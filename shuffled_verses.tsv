Travis Scott	33	SKELETONS	ASTROWORLD	2018	[Verse]	"We just rocked Coachella, I gave her half of the check
It was good sex, honorable mention to the neck
()
Didn't pass the loud, that was out of respect
Afterwards, pass the towel, I was out of Kleenex
If you take a girl out, do you expect sex?
If she take her titties out, do you expect checks?
First visit, I gave her a pearl necklace
Next visit, I'ma need your girl naked
Took a church visit, you know, 'cause the world hectic"
Kendrick Lamar	16	For Sale? (Interlude)	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Chorus]	"Get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (Want you)
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I (Want you)"
Snoop Dogg	0	Bitch Niggaz	2001	1999	[Interlude]	"Bitch niggas (Bitch niggas)

Eric B. & Rakim	14	What’s On Your Mind	Don’t Sweat the Technique	1992	[Verse 1]	"I seen her in the subway, on my way to Brooklyn
""Hello, good lookin', is this seat tooken?""
On the A-train, pickin' at her brain
I couldn't get her number, I couldn't get her name (I'm curious!)
I said I still like your style of fashion
But I hate your high saddity attitude with a passion
Is it because brothers like to hawk a lot?
Is it because you're shy and don't talk a lot?
She turned away, no play, I said okay
You don't really look good, I hope you have a bad day
Sat back, relaxed though the ride was tight
I was thinkin' of the rhymes I wrote last night
Next stop was mine, a familiar scene
I was meetin' my friend Killer Ben in Fort Greene
Where the girls are real, and tell ya how they feel
If you're soft, you're soft, or if you're hard like steel
See, I don't bend, and I won't rust
And I don't break, and I won't bust
Stomped up the street, and did I hear a treat?
Hard high heels tappin' on the concrete
I took a peek, it was the girl from the train behind me
Did she live in the area? Was she tryin' to find me?
Hmm.. I didn't wanna play myself out
I played it off, stopped and I bought a Guinness Stout
Now, was she shy? She didn't walk by
She came in the store, and she even said ""Hi""
Curiosity, at a high velocity
Maybe possibly, she had the hots for me
I said if we're playin' games, then we're gonna play mine
I'mma lay the rules 'cause it ain't much time
If you hide your feelings, and they hard to find
I wanna know what's on your mind"
Kanye West	5	POWER	My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy	2010	[Chorus]	"No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)"
Prodigy	8	Animal Instinct	Hell On Earth	1996	[Verse 2]	"To all my Mobb crimey, money-hungry and grimy
Mobb sheisty, Godfather III, and Gotti
Rapper Noyd, Ty Maxx, and Ty Nitty
Scarface and Gambino, New York City
It's P live and direct, stab the neck
Icepick bloodied up your whole entire shit
Live shit, one-nine-nine-six, ask your bitch
My crew run wild, snatch chains and bracelets
Your time's wasted for figuring P
There's two sides of me
Snake niggas obviously
You get lumped somethin' horribly and then we calmly
Guzzle Spumantely and Dom Pérignonly
Move through crowds, overproof the fuck out
After God drinks, had to shoot our fuckin' way out
Sparks flyin', niggas dyin', bitches cryin' and shout
Mobb niggas to the exit, we out"
Gang Starr	21	Aiiight Chill...	Hard to Earn	1994	[Interlude]	"Ayo, Premo, what's up, yo?

Aight? Chill"
Snoop Dogg	0	Betta Days	No Limit Top Dogg	1999	[Chorus]	"Be smart, fresh start is all you need
First things first cuz, stop smokin cess weed
You are what you smoke, my nigga stop hating
That's why you broke and that's why we celebrating
""But life's so hard on a G"", that's what they all say
But somehow someway, you got to make a better way
(Somehow someway)
You got to make a better way
(You got to make a better way)
You got to make a better way

You got to make a better way

Future	30	Rockstar Chainz	Pluto x Baby Pluto	2020	[Verse 1]	"I'ma get me a B up out it, started with a milli'
Made it out the trenches, I can't ever plead guilty
Crushed her heart when she found out I crushed her friend
Played it smart 'cause either way, I gotta win
I wear my heart on my sleeve, they ain't real as me
We could've kept it way more cordial, but it's chemistry
You kept me over through the night and boost my energy
I'm thankin' you, I'm thankin' me for curiosity
Coolest thing to do is to be cool with a nigga and fuckin' on his bitch
I know niggas'd do it to me so I'm always gon' send that hit
She said she true and she said she loyal, that's how they come to me
I know what really turn you on and I'ma keep our secret"
Nas	9	God Love Us	Nastradamus	1999	[Verse 1]	"He who has ears, let him hear
And he who has sight, let him see
He who has life, let him be
See, everything goes through change
Those who know, don't talk
And those who talk don't know a thing
Men are born soft and turn tough
Dead, they are stiff and hard, I've been kissed by God
I've been hurt, I've been marked for death, almost ripped apart
By the beast, but he missed his mark
Alone in the dark, my thoughts had sparked up
When I saw my body on the floor, from above, I watched it all
Yo, it came to me, the pain in me
Many slain empty skulls where a brain should be
It strangely seemed, like it was a dream
But the si-rens had never woke me
Only reason I'm here now is 'cause God chose me
And to me, I'm only just a crook nigga
But God love us hood niggas"
50 Cent	19	Gangsta Shit	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Chorus]	"They, they talking that
That gangsta shit
They ain't about that
Man, matter of fact
Hand me my strap
Show me where they at, I'll stop 'em from talking like that
They, they talking that
That gangsta shit
They ain't about that
Man, matter of fact
Hand me my strap
Show me where they at, I'll stop 'em from talking like that"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Chapter Six	Section.80	2011	[Chorus]	"Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one, one)
Oh, oh, we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one, one, one, one, one)
Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life

Dr. Dre	1	Compton’s N The House (Remix)	Straight Outta Compton	1988	[Verse 1]	"To the people over there
To the people, the people, the people, people, the people, the people, people
From everywhere watching the show
Paying top dollars because they know
When we're on the stage, we're in a muthafuckin' rage
What up?
Yeah
And show 'em how Eazy-Duz-It
So if you punks wanna make somethin' of it
Step up, run up, get up, what's up, suckers?
Then you're a stupid muthafucka
Kickin' - like the kick from a kickdrum
Yella boy on the drum gettin' dumb
Programmin' - a beat that's hittin'
And if you listen then you know we're not bullshittin'"
Dr. Dre	1	What’s the Difference	2001	1999	[Verse 1]	"Back when Cube was rollin' with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business
But sometimes, the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga, Doc, and Eazy, I'm still wit' you
Fuck the beef, nigga, I miss you, and that's just being real wit' you
You see, the truth is, everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then, I got these fake-ass niggas I first blew with
Claimin' they nonviolent, talkin' like they— (Do not resist the beat)
Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
Move units, then talk shit, and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speakin' your name
Just keep my name out of your mouth, and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference"
Kurupt	4	The Hardest Mutha Fuckaz	Space Boogie: Smoke Oddessey	2001	[Verse 4]	"Yeah, a penny for your thoughts in a hour glass of time
Surround sound beats for the Dogg Pound chiefs
Jump the volts up in each single switch
Stick somethin fat up in each single bitch
Bombshell, and for every dick apiece
That ain't from the hood driftin get 5 shells each
Split bustaz, no bustaz allowed
No punk motha fuckaz allowed, loosen the crowd
Dogg Pound say it loud (Dogg Pound!)
Scream it at the top of your lungs
Tell these niggas where we from
Say Kurupt...Kurupt (Kurupt!)
Yeah nigga the hardest mutha fucka in here

Remy, gin and juice, tequila, and grapefruit
Chocolate thai, indigo sticks, and a thick bitch

Down at the Dogg House with Dre, Cube, & Ren"
Snoop Dogg	0	Vapors	Tha Doggfather	1996	[Verse 1]	"Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season of catching the vapors
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is tell you how it's spreading throughout my crew
Well you all know Nate Dogg, who sings on my records
""Never Leave Me Alone"", ""Ain't No Fun"", now check it
Back in the days before Nate Dogg began
He used to try to holler at this girl named Pam
The type of female with fly Gucci gear
She wore a big turkish rope with a weave in her hair
When they tried to kick it, she'd always fess
Talking about, ""Baby please, you out here serving stress""
Since he wasn't no type of big chronic dealer
The homie Nate Dogg didn't appeal to her
But now he wear boots that match with his suits
And push a Lexus Coupe that's extra cheap
And now she stopped fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming round the Pound every single weekend
To get his beeper number she be begging please
Dying for the day to eat these"
Scarface	11	The Diary	The Diary	1994	[Outro]	"Ayy, ayy, ayy, where you fin to go, fool?
(I can't fuck with it, you got it, man)
Come on, nigga! You wanna rap, nigga?
(I can't do it) Let's rap nigga, come on
You see, you see! That's how motherfucker is, dogg
That's how motherfuckers be, funky ass hoes
You motherfuckers better quit fucking with me like this
That's really doe"

I never meant to bring you to my world

I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
But now you're sittin' in the corner, crying
And now it's my fault, my fault"
Snoop Dogg	0	I Knew That	BUSH	2015	[Chorus]	"I knew that, I knew that
You were lookin' at me
That's when the blood start rushing
I knew that, I knew that
You would leave your spot when you got hot
And you're goin' again
I love when you seein' she's goin' to the bathroom
Got 5 minutes to exchange them buds
No I'm not callin' you, what's your sign
I know your name, it must be under cover"
Travis Scott	33	SIRENS	UTOPIA	2023	[Verse 2]	"Now I got your attention (Look out)

Big Pun	24	Watch Those	Yeeeah Baby	2000	[Verse 1]	"I'm quick to dumb out, run up in yo' crib with the guns out
Spray your peeps, smack the baby teeth out your son mouth
Who can stop me? I told shorty I'ma shoot you papi
Caught him in the crapper with the clapper;
While he was doin caci
I'll probably die in jail - make it through life and fry in hell
Either way I'ma lead the way, 'cause only time'll tell
I rhyme for real, not that imaginary vocabulary
I really will stab you and every one of my adversaries
There's no remorse - fuck these thug niggas, show me the boss
Gimme a hustle worth the risk of goin' up North
I love my freedom, and you know I love my bein'
So sometimes I gotta get ugh and mug for my per diem
I'll see him in hell, we'll settle it there, better it there
And no innocent bystanders to get hit with a spare
Like I really care who catches strays from the MAC
Like I really care who you paid to rap on your track
Nigga you wack - you ain't bringing nuttin for us
I got songs with the Devil and Jesus singin on the chorus
You can't ignore us, nigga you know how we roll
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole"
Kendrick Lamar	16	The Art of Peer Pressure	good kid, m.A.A.d city	2012	[Verse 3]	"Braggin' 'bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain't got the CD in
But Jeezy still playin'
And our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you sayin'?""
Pull in front of the house
That we been campin' out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want"
Kanye West	5	Black Skinhead	Yeezus	2013	[Verse 2]	"Stop all that coon shit (Black)
Early morning cartoon shit (Black)

Back out the tomb, bitch (Black)
Black out the room, bitch (Black)
Stop all that coon shit (Black)

Big Boi	26	Liberation	Aquemini	1998	[Verse 2]	"How many times I sit back and contemplate?
I'm fresh off the dank but I'm tellin' my story
My relationship with my folks is give-and-take
And I done took so much, now give me my glory
To have a choice to be who you wants to be
It's left up-a to me and my mama n'em told me (Yes, she did)

Scarface	11	On My Block	The Fix	2002	[Verse 2]	"On my block, we duck the nigga-haters and the cops
Fuck a IROC, we race Impalas, chromed-out
On my block, it ain't no different than the next block
You get drunk and pass out, and they back you to the house
And when you wake up on the couch, you going right back at it
On my block, when you're that fucked up, they laugh at it
On my block, it's just another day in the heart
Of the Southside of Houston Texas, making your mark
On my block, we're cuing all the time, playing dominoes
Keep the Swishers sweet down until my mama goes back inside
Then we can fly, pass it around a few times to get high"
The Game	13	Touchdown	LAX	2008	[Verse 3]	"There she go again talking all that (trash)

Get inside you and (slash)
You drive me crazy girl, I could just (crash)
Jump in your pool and (splash)

Big Boi	26	13th Floor/Growing Old	ATLiens	1996	[Verse 4]	"Like some eagles, people don't understand
Just like their parents don't be caring
I'm speakin' about you playing with that phony stuff you sharing
In your raps Mercedes Benz and all your riches
Thinking you got it but get it, get it but you ain't pimping no bitches
'Cause you flau-ging; falling like leaves into driveways
Isn't it lovely smoking good and sloppy head on highways
Fridays are tight but Saturday just makes it old
Winter nights are hot warm enough to feed your soul
Growing old"
Big Pun	24	Parental Discretion	Capital Punishment	1998	[Verse 2]	"Aiyo, my shit's the truth, 150 proof, no question
Parental discretion advised, keep out the eyes of the youth
It's too explicit, bullshit! I challenge the statistics
Violence existed before our music was even suggested
Arrested on sight, it's like there's no rights
That's why I rhyme so aggressive and bring every message to life
I Fight the Power, spike the powder — the 90 percent
Keep 10 and feed Twin half for personal reasons
The seasons change, things rearrange, but I stay the same
I played the game for the wealth until I've made myself a name
So blame it all on the gangster rapper
Thanks to Joey Crack for the chance to do it My Way like Frank Sinatra
I ain't an actor, so it's all facts
Strictly raw rap, totally intensive for y'all
Dressed in all black, with the ski mask or the pantyhose
Makin' cameos in liquor store cameras with the twin Calicos"

Scarface	11	Safe	The Fix	2002	[Verse 3]	"So listen up my niggas, and I ain't tryin to preach
I'm just tellin it from my side 'cause I'm in the streets
I done been there, done that, seen a whole neighborhood
Destroyed by the government bein tipped off by one rat
He caught a dope case and they threatened him with time
He get his own fuckin people jammed and he take the five
That's the shit there; they ain't even catch him with dope
But they gave him thirty-five years 'cause the nigga done spoke
Snitchin, that's a motherfucker, watch what you say
You don't know no-motherfuckin-body, nigga, you lame
Watch your so-called homeboys, keep to yourself
Stay away from niggas gettin caught that get out of jail
Don't talk about your business, keep yo' thoughts in yo' head
And this game it got a paper trail, watch where ya spend
Don't write down names and numbers, it's a memory thing
Never shit where ya sleep, keep the crib out of range
And plus you never let these niggas know where you stay
'Cause when the push turns to a shove, they hittin your safe
True motherfuckin' game, true motherfuckin' game"

Scarface	11	On My Block	The Fix	2002	[Verse 1]	"Every day, it's been the same old thang on my block
You either working or you slanging cocaine on my block
You had to hustle, 'cause that's how we was raised on my block
And you stayed on your hop until you made you a knot
On my block, to hang out was the thing back then
And even when you left out, you came back in
To my block, from Holloway, Bellfort, to Scott
Reed Road to Phlox, we know the spots
Smoke weed and rocks, drink all the blue dots
On your block, you pro'ly bred a Fat Pat or 2Pac
Or Big Pun, or B-I, your homeboys from knee-high
And even when it was storming outside, that nigga'd be by
That's me, dog, on my block, I ain't have to play the big shot
Niggas knew me back when I was stealing beers from Shamrock
And my nickname was ""Creepy""
If Black June could see me, he'd be tripping
And I'd bet he still try to tease me"

André 3000	27	SpottieOttieDopaliscious	Aquemini	1998	[Verse 2]	"As the plot thickens, it gives me the dickens, reminiscent of Charles
A lil' discotheque nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville, USA
Via Atlanta, Georgia
A lil' spot where young men and young women go to experience they first little taste of the night life
Me? Well, I've never been there
Well, perhaps, once, but I was so engulfed in the Ol' E', I never made it to the door
You speak of hardcore
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems and troubles of the day
While this fine, bow-legged girl, fine as all outdoors, lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with ""Set It Off"" in the right
But it all blends perfectly, if you let the liquor tell it
""Hey, hey—look, baby, they playin' our song!""
And the crowd goes wild, as if Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality, it's only about 3 a.m., and three niggas just done got hauled off in the ambulance, sliced up
Two niggas done started busting—""Wham! Wham!""
And one nigga done took his shirt off, talking 'bout, ""Now, who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Court?""
It's just my interpretation of the situation"
50 Cent	19	Beg For Mercy	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Chorus]	"Sticks and stones may break bones and the shells may hurt me

Keep your eyes wide open, nigga's lookin' for a jux
Shit is real 'round here, you surrounded by crooks"
Dr. Dre	1	A Nigga Witta Gun	The Chronic	1992	[Verse 3]	"I breaks 'em off, but I ain't speaking about between the thighs
I'm talking about cocking a gauge in between your eyes
It'll make you drop to your knees 'cause you realize
That a gat'll make any nigga civilized
Old buster-ass nigga talking bullshit
Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
Get lit or hit up by the doctor
A nigga that breaks 'em off properly
Real G, so don't doubt it
I'm the one who's doin' it while these other niggas talk about it
And if motherfuckers come at me wrong
I straight put my forty-four Desert Eagle to his motherfuckin' dome
And show him why they call me the notorious one
The name is Dre Eastwood when I'm packing a gun
You don't believe me, well step up and give it a try
And if you die, you's a buster, 'cause real niggas don't die
But some still don't hear me, though
You're too near me not to hear me, nigga, yo
So now you know"

I'm creepin' with you, sleepin' with you
It's gettin' bad on a nigga, now I'm beepin' you too
And meet me at the hot spot and work that skirt
You know the blue one, the new one, girl you know the truth hurt
Heart beatin' while I'm cheatin', tryna catch a nut
Bad little bitch got a nigga caught up
I'm slidin' in the rag top Chevorlet
Got a nigga all out of bounds in West L.A
I'm tryin to find your granny's house, is your auntie house
Well um, you know we sorta kinda burn it out
You know I turn it out whenever I'm in the mix
I'm creepin' with my secret (Shhhh) and that's how I wanna keep it, peep this"

My style's smoking like after a Glock spit
Game get the blood money, fuck bitches and pop Crys'
-tal like it's New Year's, cause this a new year
Look at the tracks, either Bigfoot or The Game been through here
The Benjamins won't stop, and neither would a chrome Glock
I kill a fire-breathin' dragon wit a dome shot
Come through your hood in a Chevy Malibu, on stocks
We had a meeting before we got here, so shit gon' pop
Heads gon' roll, Patron gon' spill
Fitted caps getting peeled like the chrome on the wheels
Got a half a mil' say your wounds won't heal
I declare war, nigga who gon' deal?"

They played your freestyle over 'Wipe Me Down'
They played it two times, said it might be crowned
As the best thing out the H-Town in a while""
He picked up his son with a great big smile
Rapped every single word to the newborn child
Then he put him down and went back to the kitchen
And put on another beat and got back to the mission of
Get his momma out the hood, put her somewhere in the woods
Keep his lady looking good, have her rolling like she should
Show his homies there's a way, other than that flippin' yay
Bail his homie out of jail, put a lawyer on his case
Throw a concert for the school, show the shorties that it's cool
Throw some candy on the Caddy, chuck the deuce and act a fool
Man, it feels good when it happens like that
Two days from going back to selling crack, yessir"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	Casualties of War	Don’t Sweat the Technique	1992	[Verse 2]	"Day divides the night and night divides the day
It's all hard work and no play
More than combat, it's far beyond that
'Cause I got a kill-or-be-killed kind of attack
Area's mapped out, there'll be no, Stratego
Me and my platoon make a boom wherever we go
But what are we here for? Who's on the other side of the wall?
Somebody give the President a call
But I hear warfare scream through the air
Back to the battlegrounds, it's war they declare
A Desert Storm, let's see who reigns supreme
Something like Monopoly - a government scheme
Go to the Army, be all you can be
Another dead soldier? Hell no, not me
So I start lettin' off ammunition in every direction
Allah is my only protection
But wait a minute, Saddam Hussein prays the same
And this is Asia, from where I came
I'm on the wrong side, so change the target
Shootin' at the general, and where's the sergeant?
Blame it on John Hardy Hawkins for bringin' me to America
Now it's mass hysteria
I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor
Causalities Of War"

Fuck is that? Stop hammering, goddamn (Guys, hey, stop arguing)
That's what it sounds like in my brain
Much as I fight to restrain
I have the right to remain violent
Any rhyme that I say can and will be used against you
Icicle veins, mics'll get slain

But life making records ain't easy
It ain't what I expected, it's hectic, it's sleazy
But I guess that the streets is harder
Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
My homie is making it elsewhere
Striving, working nine-to-five with no health care
We both had dreams of being great
But his deferred and blurred and changed in shape
It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make
To be great, I'm giving it all it takes
Trying to shake the crates and fakes and snakes
I gotta take my place or fall from grace
The bullet's late, the pace is quick and great
Smiling face to hide the trace of hate
But my homie would never do me wrong
That's why I wrote this song, if you ever need me, it's on
No matter who the foe, they must fall

Wasn't supposed to get introduced to that (To that)
I don't deserve to get used to that

And I tell her, 'That ain't your job'

Wild hair and rock smells make the cops tail

With afrocentric stamps I'm mailin' thoughts to my Gods held in court
I dwell where rebellion's taught, and emotions seldom walk
I try to walk like an Egyptian, but Hieroglyphics fail to talk
I guess the hustlin is the unspoken Gospel
Love that I'm an apostle, feel the holy spirit of Chicago

Since pimps was pushin' pink Caddies
With the fish tank pumps
Bumpin' and grindin' simultaneously windin'
Climbin' up the walls screamin' big dog you wasn't lyin'
I'm a diamond in the rough, crushin' in my cabin
You ain't fit for the job if can't fit the magnum, yo

Slammin Cadillac doors and mackin whores on the regular
You used to boost, the slickest of suits
Climbin through the back windows on the bus, you was ill Dukes
Until that chick you vicked, for the Cutlass

Affecting lives is where the wealth and the merit is
I realize what I portray day to day, I gotta carry this
And beats, rhymes and life is where the marriage is
Had dreams of fucking R&B broads, it came true
Journalist I wreck, shared the same view
Picked up a fallen angel on the path that I emcee
Familiar voice, come to find out the angel was me

Okay, okay, okay

I ain't stunting these hoes, man, I'm 'bout my paper
If your bitch really 'bout it, nigga, I'm gon' take her
Backseat of my Jeep, fuck 'til I fuck up her makeup (Uh-huh)
Take her to the Diamond District, introduce her to Jacob (Woo)
Tell her if she like me, she should keep me icy
My game fuck with a bitch brain 'til she think she wifey (Yeah)
Spent her life savings in a day, 'cause she likes me
Committment from me, uhh... nah, not likely
Went out with Vivica, I thought
I was onto something
But then the next week, nah
Man, it was nothing (Hahaha)"

Stay in your little hole, then coward, duck your head

Is what I say, best run the other way
In case of physical breakdown, y'all can break now
My kitchen full of heat, if you can't take the temp'
Make yourself exempt
Pussy-footin' around be gettin' y'all nowhere but stuck
Nowhere to duck, bullets flyin', niggas dyin'
By gettin' blasted, how drastic
They got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do
I got the nerve to serve you up just like a waiter do
But naw (Naw, naw), I take that back, that's my problem
Turnin' and walkin' away just ain't gon' work when they be robbin'

Don't matter where you from, if you old or young
Seesaw we raw like ooh-la-la
Fuck the law, we don't get caught, we just do-da-da
Yeah nigga we shakin' the cops
You niggas out there just be makin' it hot

For men that get pornographic with that chick

Eminem	15	Careful What You Wish For	Relapse	2009	[Verse 1]	"So this is it, this is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But somethin' changed the minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit, then it turned me to a monster
I became a hypocrite, concert after concert
I was rakin' in the dough, rollin' in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sewin' machine
But I was losin' my freedom, there was nowhere for me
To not go and be seen, and just go and be me
And there was no in-between, you either loved it or hate it
Every CD, critics gave it a three, then three
Years later they go back and re-rate it
And call The Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic, The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be Illmatic
And eight years later, I'm still at it
Divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleepin' pill addict
And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk"
Scarface	11	Sellout	The Fix	2002	[Verse 2:]	"Fo sho I talk a lot of shit but you can bet that I'm the nigga
Out here backing it up, while you acting it up
I can prove you ain't as real as what you claiming to be
You the king on your block, but you ain't shit in DC
You ain't shit off in the city of Chi
You ain't shit off in the Do It or Die
They want to skin you alive
Out here talking like you carrying arms
We don't shoot at motherfuckers, we done flipped the script to carrying bombs
I can end it for niggas out here who's hard in the booth
Any city I can hit the hood cause Scar is the truth
I know so much about these streets that I can walk them asleep
You can't tell me shit about your hood, I walked on your beat
I know your whole life story, plus I've seen for myself
You got caught smoking dope, that's why they sent you to jail
Had you locked up with wet backs, only real niggas suffer set backs
90 days and I ain't goin' to respect that
And you can sniff a snitch a mile away
Fuck him in his ass and feed him dick, a pound a day"

I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care
And, uh, I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em
You know what makes me unhappy? (What's that?)
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
()
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't, we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up"

Common	22	The Corner	Be	2005	[Verse 3]	"Black church services, murderers, Arabs servin' burgers
As cats with gold permanents move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn't just fertile, it's people workin' and earnin' this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It's so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is, where the money movin', the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
It's so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners"
Eminem	15	Marsh	Music to Be Murdered By	2020	[Verse 1]	"Checked in at the Royal Garden
To chill and avoid my problems
Until paranoia caused me
To feel like I'm going bonkers
For real, think my toilet's talkin'
I spilled like, like forty bottles
Of pills, think your boy is startin'
To feel like a spoiled carton of milk
'Cause it just occurred
My girl's cheatin', I'm kickin' that fucking bitch to the curb
But the word ""fucking"" ain't meant to be a descriptive word
The type of bitch she is, ain't no adjective, it's a verb
Ho thinks her snatch is magical
But that's how she attracts men, though
Traps 'em and attack similar to an actual arachnid
Or a vaginal tarantula or black widow
In fact, it'll be nothin' to throw that lil' bitch with a capital B out the back window
Of the black Cadillac limo like a whack demo
When I'm strapped, when I spit rapid, like a ratchet
A halfwit, I'll aim at, then I'll
Been fire bitch, I can outrap Reynolds
A pad and pen'll be great, but a napkin'll do
Return of the whack sicko
Head spinnin' like Invisibl Skratch Piklz
Yeah, Shady's back, see the bat signal
It's time to go bat shit, like you accidentally ate a Louisville slugger and crapped it
I'd like to introduce myself
Hi there, bitch..."

Struck it rich with the struck of the luck of the Dutch
Tripled you up, you little late for the flush (Flush)
You got plans for honeymoon (Honeymoon)
I got plans to move your fine ass up in my living room
At the studio on the D-low, is you with it? (With it, never leave you, no)
You gots to stay committed
To do what I say, no matter how I spit it
You're with it

Now go"
Kurupt	4	A Doggz Day Afternoon	Dogg Food	1995	[Verse 3]	"D.P.G. eliminates the whole area
Beyond the thought dismemberin', muthafuck surrenderin'!
Who? What? When? Let's tear shit the fuck up!
The homies coolin' while you and ya chest get fuckin' blew in
Provoke us, survey wit' the superior focus
I'm Dat Nigga like Daz, crooked as scoliosis
It's impossible to survive on my arrival
When I arrive, it's left to ya instinct of survival
Mashin', cashin' in chips, I gotta lick
Sadistic, sick minded I find it, I'm mentally sick
And badder, it doesn't matter when ya enterin'
Ya just entered in a war zone all alone
Wit' ya microphone unguarded
I just started — poetical poltergeist precise and cold-hearted
Empty! Tempt me? Simply ya get shot
Ya forgot I'm down to empty out my clip on ya block
Stop! Make the whole place evacuate
Wait until we face-to-face, then it escalates
Duck down! Kurupt clowns niggas daily, hoes can't play me
Observe — I serve those that betray me!"
Eminem	15	Business	The Eminem Show	2002	[Verse 2]	"Quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers, Dre, holy bat syllables!
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone, time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it
Flow's too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People, when you're rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!"
Jay-Z	12	Can’t Knock the Hustle	Reasonable Doubt	1996	[Verse 2]	"Last seen out of state where I drop my sling
I'm deep in the South, kicking up top game
Bouncing on the highway, switching fo' lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thang
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
Why play with fire? You burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
'Til legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
What y'all don't know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 'cause you can't knock the hustle"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	Keep the Beat	Don’t Sweat the Technique	1992	[Verse 1]	"She asked could I keep the beat?
So, here's the beat, every time it pounds, you get weak
Comfy, embedded like a pillow, bouncin' with an echo
My voice is moist and plus mellow
I got it goin' on, you're gonna wanna come
Skins is the drum, I said I'm the drummer, give the drummer some
And we'll see if you can hang wit' Ra
Hmm, let's see if you can Shangri-La
Easy like Teena Marie, I play it slick like Rick James
I'm the Fire and your Desire's flames
I heat up your temperature, keep the tempo raw
When you start to smoke, rest assured
I start to think 'cause you're a singer like Anita
High pitched like a tweeter, deep beats start to beat her
Much harder than love taps, my rap's above that
I get girls where I want with a maze full of love traps
But I don't want to fall in love
I stand in love, good balanced with a plan to shove
Acapella as we start to speak
Heart to heart and cheek to cheek
Then I complete the beat"

Everyday up on your life thank your God for your life
That money makes the world go round
Without a doubt
They all want to see you about a clout
They don't know, don't want to know or see what it's about
We faced with danger, do any thing for the paper
Scarred for life mentality of the street life made us
Watch out for the snakes and fakes
Out to take what's yours to make it theirs so prepare and beware
Money makes the world go round for some niggas
Money make the world kill all niggas quicker
The sckrilla, the cabbage, the cheese, the scratch, the cheddar
Whatever you call it, it's all hot"
JAY-Z	6	Smile	4:44	2017	[Verse 3]	"I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic 'bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me, that was nothin'

Ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy
Anita Baker's ""You Bring Me Joy"" slappin' out of the toy
The separation is clear
In my rear-view mirror objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah, I was born with a pair, playin' for high stakes
Norman's Cay, he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
In charge of my own fate, respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power, huh
So our music is ours, niggas own their own houses
Ours was, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Now it's, ""Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue""
That blood money I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss' habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, I still ain't trippin'
That's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America like me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, ""Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips""
God sent me to break the chain, I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh, what did I do? 'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside a line or two
Oh, these that drugs, heron flow
I spaz on the stove, this is Hov, no flex zone
Nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you're a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Feel for you bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter, smile"

'Cause to me they ain't nothing but harassers
That misuse they badges to whip niggas' asses
Then one day they slow rolled through the hood
With the .38s cocked, 2 deep, up to no good
They say that my skin was black so they attacked
Threw me my back and stuck a gat to my fucking cap
One murdered my man like it was okay
For the life he ended he got suspended with no pay
But if a man woulda took the cop life, he woulda got life
And never again see the street lights and that's trife
Around my way they shot many teens
And them cops better stop or I'ma stop 'em by any means
The Big L won't hesitate to cold diss 'em
And if you ask me, motherfuck the whole system
There are too many young black brothers doing life bids
'Cause justice means, 'just us white kids'
So take heed to the rhymes I kick
I'm about to flip

Street's a matter of life and death, no regrets
Life's a test, it's trife with special effects
Neighborhood's full of reps, cities are projects
Where the young cadets get stripes from the vets
And comrades to quest to be the next to finesse
Collect debts and select bets with death threats
Object — cheddar; better your total net
Where trends are set from ways to express the outfits
Friends get wet tryin' to make ends connect
Avenues to check, boulevards to sweat
The smell of gunsmoke's more common than cigarettes
(WE GOT) cliques for wreck
(WE LIKE) Pits for pets
(WE GOT) Giants and Jets, the Knicks, Yanks and Mets
(WE LIKE) much respect, the sex extra wet
And high-tech dialect you ain't catch yet
The Bronx

No doubt!
Brooklyn
Ya out there?"

Got friends that ask me for money knowin' I'm in debt
And like my wife said, I still didn't say no
People tryna say I'm goin' crazy on Twitter
My friends' best advice was to stay low
I guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills
Especially when you got family members on payroll
The media said it was outlandish spendin'
The media said he's way out of control
I just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'
I'm not out of control, I'm just not in their control
I know I'm the most influential
That TIME cover was just confirmation
This generation's closest thing to Einstein
So don't worry about me, I'm fine
I can see a thousand years from now in real life
Skate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like
Troll conventional thought, don't need to question
I know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive
Thank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission
Did it with no permission, on our own conditions
Most blacks with money have been beaten to submission
Yeezy with the big house, did it way different
Never listen to Hollywood producers
Don't stare at money too long, it's Medusa

What the fuck is goin on? This rap game is made to make money
You niggas is taking the shit outta hand, actin' way too funny
Doin too much, y'know I see it from the get-go
What the fuck's goin on wit you niggas, y'all tryin to play a low pro
And tryin ta be hard and tryin ta be big willies or whatever they call it
I guess it's time for me to act just like an alcoholic
And step to the game, I'm a stumble in like I don't know
And if a nigga say somethin wrong, I'm takin off from the get-go
I ain't givin no room to try to get me first
Cos I done been bombed on before and I'mma tell you, man, that's the worst
Fifth in the world, but I'mma keep my thang together
Cos I'mma keep makin money and hope everything is still together
Havin papers, man, now what y'all niggas doin?
All y'all broke on the corner
Drinkin your drink, wanna be doin what I'm doin
But don't get mad and don't be tryin to play-hate
Cos, uhh, takin trips around state to state
Representin, uhh, what y'all wanna represent
But y'all can't represent it cos y'all got no dollars, no cents
I'm movin on, groovin on and I'm movin
Makin more moves than the average Cuban
Tryin ta get G's across the town, tryin ta make more hits
And tryin ta get my game tight and get at your bitch
Now if she wants to get with this, she gone come holla at a player, do'
Cos she know that Snoop Dogg is got that white Rolls Royce
And she wants to jump in, bring a friend
Cos everything is like alphabet, come on in
Come on in and bring a friend and you can come on back
Cos when you do, we gone be sippin on some Cognac
It's on me, I'm feelin good tonight
Cos I'mma do mines and I'mma keep everything tight
I ain't lettin nothin leak cos if thangs leak, then I'm get caught
And I can't get caught cos you know how they do it about that child support
Shit, bitches is cold on a nigga who ain't got his game tight
Gettin 18-point-5 percent, half your life
Shit, I love my baby boy and all
But I ain't gonna be payin no bitch, no no, no way Dogg
I'm too slick on my toes, I'm too tight
I'm guaranteed to get away from some shit like dat, ain't that right
Cos, uhh, when you play in this game you got to be the real player
You can't be no fake ass nigga talkin about you wanna be the man
Cos if you ain't with the game, the game ain't gonna be wit you
And I can put that on everything including you"
Nas	9	Hate Me Now	I Am...	1999	[Verse 1]	"Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, flows that I try
Close your eyes, picture me rollin' sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that's swollen, the riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed, Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence, for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gate dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate? Be my guest, I suggest –"
50 Cent	19	My Toy Soldier	The Massacre	2005	[Verse 1]	"Listen up close now, follow instructions
Catch a nigga slippin, run up on him and buck him
I ain't got no conscience, no morals or nothin'
They ain't wit us, they against us, we supposed to touch 'em
Here's what to do if you see him approach me
Pop that nigga, I don't care if he know me
Half the niggas hatin on me used to be homies
I don't trust 'em when they smile or when they frown cause they phony
Everytime I come around they call the police on me
That's why the D's in the precinct know me
They know about my rap sheet, they know 'bout how I clap heat
Run like I'm in a track meet, swift with the mac, B
You can see the envy in they eyes fo' sho' mayn
Mad as a motherfucker that I'm holdin
See me in the back of the Phantom, rollin
Quick to make examples out of niggas fo' sho' man, hold me down"
Future	30	Drankin N Smokin	Pluto x Baby Pluto	2020	[Chorus]	"We drink up and we smoke, but she always do the most
It kinda turns me on the way she lickin' on my stones
My chains on antifreeze, it look like I made a clone
Wanna see you get more sassy, if it bring out better emotions
She called me her God, the way I floated in her ocean"
The Game	13	Don’t Worry	The Documentary	2005	[Verse 4]	"It used to be caramel skin tones, Sprewell rims on
Glass house, ass out, Jacob watch, gemstones
Bandanna, Nike Airs, tennis bracelet, wife hair
Black rag, do or die, .45 right here
Every time I was down, you was always right there
Whenever visitin hours came, I know my wife there
So pink diamonds right here, chain hang, ice there
The reason for my tattooed tear - I need you to hold me down"
Snoop Dogg	0	Snoop D.O. Double G	R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece	2004	[Verse Three]	"""Whatchu gone do next, how you gone say it
When yo album come out dawg, I can't wait to play it
Tell the truth, my nigga, I love all ya work""
Well, from me to you loc, welcome to the Church
Mi casa, su casa
So, get ya drank on and smoke on nigga, go on an' boss up
You can holla at baby, it's ok to me
Damn, I love it when them motherfuckers say to me"
Daz Dillinger	2	Doggy Dogg World	Doggystyle	1993	[Verse 3]	"Diggity-Daz out of the motherfuckin' cut once mo'
So grab a seat and grab your gin and juice and check out the flow
I flip-flop and serve hoes with the fat dick
'Til I die, I'm still screamin' out (""Bitches ain't shit"")
Now, I'm the mack daddy, had he
Not known about the city where I'm from, dum-diddy-dum
As you groove to the gangster shit
The D-O-double G, the P-O-U-N-D, the gangster clique
Now as Tha Pound break it down with the gangster funk
I can see and I can tell that's what the fuck you want
So I blaze up the chronic so I can get high
I promise I'll smoke chronic 'til the day that I die"
MC Ren	17	Real Niggaz (LP Version)	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Verse 1]	"Prisoner like a hostage
Yo, you should've covered your muthafucking head like an ostrich
Deep in the dirt cause you's a sucker
Bend ya ass up high so I can kick the muthafucker
Don't try to hang, you best avoid
Cause my foot will be so far up you ass, you'll get hemorrhoids
Because if you try to fuck wit Ren
I'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting a size 10"
Lil Uzi Vert	31	Off Dat	Pluto x Baby Pluto	2020	[Chorus]	"Smoke good gas (Gas), might cough back
Move good work (Work), that soft pack (What?)
Gotta off that (Yeah), gotta off that (Yeah)
Gotta off that (Yeah, ), gotta off that (Yeah, )
Gotta off that (Yeah, ), gotta off that (Yeah, )
Gotta off that (Yeah, ), then relapse (Yeah, yeah)"
Common	22	Testify	Be	2005	[Verse 3]	"The judge yelled for order court
Reporter making her words shorter
His lawyer sat next to him
She could see how the trial was affecting him
It hurt for her eyes to connect with him
Using her lies for protecting him
They arrested him for murder and gun possession
As they read back her confession, she screamed"
Eminem	15	Berzerk	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 3]	"And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yo—we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are, though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And, girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow (Ha-ha!)
Word, Rick? (Word, man, you heard)
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam"
Eminem	15	Evil Twin	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 1]	"I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grimmin' every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
‘Cause I'm mentally rearrangin' his face
I need a change of pace
‘Cause the pace I'm workin' at's dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger, and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey
And started slowly roastin' 'em
‘Cause that's where most of my anger is based
Fuck your feelings
I feel like I play for the Saints
I just wanna hurt you—aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanyes, Jays, Waynes, and the Drakes
I'm frustrated ‘cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm goin' all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is, I'm strapped for battle
Suck a duck, crawl out the back—it's a bar fight
Prepare your arsenal
And beware of bar stools flyin' through the air and bottles breakin', mirrors also
And I ain't stoppin' 'til the swear jar's full
""You done called every woman a slut but you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall"" (Palin)
Oh, my bad, slut! And next time I show up to court
I'll be naked and just wear a law suit
Judge be like, ""That's sharp
How much that motherfucker cost you, smart-ass?
You're lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker!
You're so fuckin' gravy, Marshall, I should start callin' you 'au jus'
‘Cause all's you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo""
Evil Twin, take this beat now, it's all you
I believe people can change but only for the worse
I coulda changed the world if it wasn't for this verse—so satanic
K-Mart chains panic ‘cause they can't even spin back the curse words
‘Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker
Rekcufrehtom!(Rape your mother)— Tihs!(Kill your parents)
And these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screamin', ""Fuck! Shit! Fuck!""
Adult with a childish-like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out, I was like, ""Merits?
Fuck that! I'd rather be loud, and I like swearin'""
From the first album even the gals were like, ""Tight lyrics, dreamy eyes!""
But my fuckin' mouth was nightmarish
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and opposition felt the opposite
Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches to make sure I keep up with my competition (Haha)
Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first, then ignore the replies"
The Game	13	From Adam	The Documentary 2.5	2015	[Verse 3]	"Let me tell you how I met my nigga Wack
Shit, he ain't always have a nigga back
When I met him, he was standing behind Suge
And everything is all good when you banging for your hood
Compton
That nigga Wack got my number and came through
Now let me tell you the type of shit the Game do
He walked in the booth where I was spitting
Gave him ten thousand, couldn't even finish his fuckin' sentence
I ain't owe him shit, but real recognize real
Now we like two red-nosed Pits
Cross him, you gotta cross me
And don't forget about where my nigga AR be
He be in the cut, that niggas nuts, don't give a fuck
Love his nigga Game to death, and he mean it from the guts
Blood, what's up? Which one of you dumb mothafuckas wanna try us?
()"
Common	22	Payback Is a Grandmother	Like Water for Chocolate	2000	[Verse 3]	"My imagination roamed as I got in the chair
Thinkin - when shit went
Down, I wish I was there
Fuckin with fam' - who you are, I don't care
Have your guys pourin liquor witch'ya name in they swear
These chicks claim they was there, knew the niggas who done it
Said it was Smoke and them from the Wild 100's
Eight million stories got me runnin in place, it's gettin tricky
(Like who?) Like dude, that do drum'n'bass
There was a air in the place, that made me suspicious
Normally, they'd be
Talkin like bitches
My barber cut me with a quickness (what?)
Asked him where he got the new bracelet
He said it was his sister's - I knew then
What made it official, he gave me my change
The money clip had gramp's
Initials (c'mon)
As I, whooped his ass up, six niggas masked up
Pulled up in a Cadillac truck
{*gunfire*}"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	Keep the Beat	Don’t Sweat the Technique	1992	[Verse 2]	"She said, ""R, so far, you didn't miss a beat yet""
Pop in another cassette, then I'm in to wreck
I'll give you a beat you never had before
I had to explore and came up with more
Deep trunk kicks with a brick for a drum stick
You know the song, don't hum along, come quick
You lay like Sade, it feels like paradise
At the top of the pyramid, we review new heights
The scenery of Egypt, you and me as we get
So deep in the groove, when you move, you get seasick
You seen enough, close your eyes and relax
Move wit' the tracks, and stay tuned for the sax
The instrumental enters your mental
Tense, but gentle and sentimental
Acapella as we start to speak
Heart to heart and cheek to cheek
Then I complete the beat"
Eminem	15	Careful What You Wish For	Relapse	2009	[Chorus]	"So be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said, ""Be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it
And if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it
'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold"""
Big Boi	26	Snappin’ and Trappin’	Stankonia	2001	[Chorus]	"Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over k.b. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating 'cause
I'll box you in your muthafuckin' mouth
Don't you be looking at me crazy like ya want to
The game is over k.b. baby won't you
Just quit the contemplating 'cause
I'll box you in your muthafuckin' mouth"
The Game	13	One Night	Doctor’s Advocate	2006	[Verse 2]	"Red bandana in my back pocket, I'm for real
This ain't a pastel color khaki suit, and I ain't Pharrell
I don't front about shit I pull my gun up out shit
And let everything fly to keep my son up outta this
I thought you loved me nigga, talk is cheap
Remember, the bulletholes in my son's car seat
My baby momma found four shells
I ain't get one ""keep your head up,"" all I got was ""keep it real""
'Keep it real' my niggas?
Last year alone I spent one point five mill' on my niggas
After the bullshit, I stayed right there
Took you to award shows, there go Jay right there
Where? Right there!
I had all you niggas in suits, cleaner than a pair of fresh Nike Airs
I'm supposed to enjoy this shit but it's quite clear
The last twelve months been a fucking nightmare"
Kanye West	5	Feedback	The Life of Pablo	2016	[Chorus]	"Ayy, ya heard about the good news?
Y'all sleeping on your boy, had a good snooze?
Wake up, nigga, wake up
It's time to get the paper"
Prodigy	8	The Start of Your Ending (41st Side)	The Infamous	1995	[Verse 2]	"Yo, it's the P-E Double, push a Lex bubble in the winter
You can't come along, only the hoes can enter
Told her to meet me at six on the hill, at the center
Took her to the west way and bent her right over
Stay intoxicated, never sober
Faced it, violate and get lace'd
Why you wastin' slugs? You ain't buckin' nothin'
You better off buckin' yourself, you need to stop frontin'
I used to drive an Ac' and kept a MAC in the engine
Littles painted in black with crack sale intentions
To blow up the whole projects
The Infamous — our sons will grow up to be murderers and terrorists
It's the nigga in me, accompanied by the Cognac
You can ask around, don't fuck with the Mobb
I could've told you that, where you been at? You must've cut class
If it ain't me, another member of my crew will kick your ass
(What, what, what)
We do damage to limbs
In '91, stompin' you out with black Timbs
Prodigy and the H-A-V-O-C, fom the Q.B.C
Puttin' cowards where they supposed to be
If I don't know your face, then don't come close to me
I got too much beef for that
Drama in the 3rd degree
And to the kids — you don't wanna be me
I'm up in the mix of action, where niggas wanna kill me
But it's the start of they endin'
My man's lendin' me his Linden
Forty-two shots dependin'
On whether or not the clip is full to the top
We bustin' caps non-stop, blazin'
In all the shows, and even at the hoes
(Nah, nah, chill, son)
What?"

Kanye West	5	Love Lockdown	808s & Heartbreak	2008	[Verse 1]	"I'm not loving you way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me all the way home
So you never know, never, never know
Never know enough 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, ""No, no, no, n-no""
I'm not loving you way I wanted to
See, I wanna move, but can't escape from you

So everybody else don't have to know"

2Pac	18	Me and My Girlfriend	The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory	1996	[Verse 3]	"I was too immature to understand your ways
Inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat you, the secret to keep you
Being faithful, ‘cause now cheating's lethal
We're closer than the hands of time
Deeper than the drive of mankind
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
In time I clock figures, droppin' niggas as we rise
We all soldiers in God's eyes
Now it's time for war, never leave me, baby
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with you loaded by my bedside, crazy
Jealous when you hang with the fellas, I wait patiently alone
Anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waitin' by the phone, this is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realest
So if you ever need me, call, I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall: me and my girlfriend"
JAY-Z	6	Never Change	The Blueprint	2001	[Verse 1]	"I am a Roc representer (Oh)

One CD or three hundred and sixty pies
What's up to E and Kirk? Welcome home to Taj
Let no amount of money ruin this thing of ours (Uh)
We run streets like drunks run streetlights
We collidin' with life as we speak
We knee-deep in coke, we key-deep in ice
We flood streets with dope, we keep weed to smoke
We all fish, better teach your folk
Give him money to eat, the next week, he's broke
'Cause when you sleep, he's reachin' for your throat
Word on the street, you reap what you sow
Not out of fear, but love, love for the game
Roc family first, we never change, man"

Big L	25	No Endz, No Skinz	Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous	1995	[Verse 1]	"Let me get to the point real quick
When your pockets are thick, mad chicks be on a brother tip
When you're sportin' jewels and drivin' in a groovy car
All the hoes gon' sweat you like a movie star
To get in your pockets, that's what them girls wanna do
But if you not rich, then them chicks gonna front on you
No matter how strong your rap
You only knock boots when you got loot and you on the map
'Cause if you broke, you'll get a whack slut
If you got dough, you get a ho with a fat butt
With fresh gear, long hair and a cute face
And if you live alone, she's gonna pack her suitcase and move in
Then you start losin' all your bucks
Soon, you broke as a joke and out of luck
Then she takes off and breaks off, your ho's gone
""So long, dear, I'm outta here"", a good relationship's been torn
'Cause when you on top, everything's okay
But when you broke, you gets no play"

Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like The Holy Qur'an
Niggas get shook like 5-0
My .45 is next to me when we ride, for survival
Money-makin' plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes ‘cause they breed freely
See me rise, located worldwide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Born on a dope fiend's titty, huh, in every city
You'll find me, look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me, nah'mean?
I hit the scene, niggas duckin' from my guillotine stare
I'm right there, my every word a fuckin' nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs, down to die for y'all
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in ’em
Cut ’em down, to Hell is where we send ’em
My whole team trained to explode, ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gon' cry
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them ""my bitch-nigga eaters""
And not a whimper until I'm gone
Thug Life runnin' through my veins so I'm strong
Bye, bye, bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggas, but I'm not gon' cry
I'm a Bad Boy killer, Jay-Z die too
Lookin' out for Mobb Deep, nigga, when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me? Yay-yay!

Should have never fucked with me
I want money, hoes, sex and weed
I won't rest until my road dog's free – bomb first"

Mmm, ah-ah
I wonder where I lost my way?
Mmm, ah-ah
Been waiting on your call all day
Tell me you in my corner right now
When I fall short, I'm leanin' on you to cry out
We all got enough to lie about
My truth too complicated to hide now
Can I open up? Is it safe or not?
I'm afraid a little, you relate or not?
Have faith a little, I might take my time
Ain't no savin' face this time"

And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot, that's how Ma$e screwed up
Throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase, so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat, haha
You see, I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's ""Dior Homme,"" not ""Dior, homie""

You love me for me, could you be more phony?"

Would he still be the ladies, most wanted, doggonit you want it
He got it-type nigga 'round the town, town, town
Had he not played it so flashy, ashy when half of these niggas

Kanye West	5	See Me Now	My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy	2010	[Verse 1]	"Now I'ma need you to kill the hypocrisy, this is an aristocracy
I'm Socrates, but my skin more chocolatey
What's up with who? That's old news
I'm in a speedboat, in my boat shoes
Huh? I swear my whole collection's so cruise
I might walk in Nobu with no shoes
""He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods
That nigga crazy, I told you""
Immature adult, insecure asshole (Aha, what else?)
If you fall on the concrete, that's your ass fault
If you pass on a Kan' beat, that's your last fault
Get what you ask for, I swear that your ass slow
She got a big booty but she couldn't drop it as low
'Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cashflow
When you gettin' money they be all up on your ass, yo
When you gettin' money cops don't let a nigga pass, go
Straight to jail yo, in a hellhole
Right next to Lucifer, tell 'em I said ""Hello""
Ask if I'ma be there soon and tell him I said ""Hell no""
Yo what you say when your people get outta jail, huh?"

Guru	20	Sabotage	The Ownerz	2003	[Verse 1]	"The names have been changed to protect the innocent
Each step is intricate, I rep magnificent
Knew this kid named Ronnie, used to make cash with Caesar
They made a lot of money back in the 80's crack fever
Caesar was an overachiever, a kingpin and 18-and-a-half
He got knocked and left Ronnie to watch the team and the stash
Plus his crib, his jewels, his whip and his girl
And Ronnie's self-interests had him livin' in a different world
He rocked Caesar's chains, he pushed Caesar's Range
Smokin' mad wools all day, with Caesar's change
Not to mention he pushed up on Caesar's wifey
A move like that my man, extremely sheisty
It all got back to Caesar in the bing
They found Ronnie's body in the playground by the swings
Anyone can get it, for sure it don't matter dawg
Especially when a nigga tries committin' sabotage"

It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under, I ponder
And try to keep my

They say become a doctor, but I don't have the patience
Adjacent to that situation
I want an occupation that I'm into
Cause yet have I begin to
Live to my potential, I went to
School for fourteen years and my best teacher was experience, I reminisce
And wish, I could go back in time to eighty-nine
When there was just' 'sunshine'
But now it's like, I'm gettin' older there's so much strain and stress
I don't think I'll ever be happy until I rest in peace
Of mind, and find who I am
But thank God I found you"

Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down, we playin' Tetris
A.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m., funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk

Prodigy	8	Hell on Earth (Front Lines)	Hell On Earth	1996	[Verse 3]	"Yo, the heavy metal king, hold big shit with spare clips
You see eclipse when the MAC spit, your top got split
Layin' dead with open eyes, close his eyelids
Turn off his lights, switch to darkness
It's deep in the abyss of street life
Blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
You's the wild child, Kicko turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power, leave my mark on this planet
The phantom of crime rap, niggas is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth like Guinness
P.O.W. niggas is found M.I.A.
We move like special forces, Green Beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in '89, the same way
The God P walk with a limp, see
But simply, to simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me, you must be bent, G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it's full for so long 'cause I don't waste shit
You properly hit, blood in your mouth so you could taste it
Quiet is kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs claimin' that they gonna rob the Mobb when they see us
I tell you what, black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take these missiles
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm tryna make cream and that's that
Whatever it takes, however it gots to go down
Four mics on stage, a motherfuckin' four-pound
Speakers leakin' out sound and niggas leakin' on the ground
I could truly care less, the God gon' get his regardless
Blow-for-blow, let's find out who hit hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself, see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point, never disregard shit
Or forget the essence from which I emerged
P is sick, so save that bullshit for the birds (Nigga)
Live up to my words, if I got beef, niggas comin' in herds (Nigga)
We flush through, your clique get purged (Word up)"

Lookin' at my fake Gucci, it's about that time
It's time for some percolator
I circulate around the block black
So give me a six-pack and a half of Harold's Chicken
A good combination
When I get bubbly, I do it in moderation
One brew, one brew, I said one brew at a time
Yes, check it
I didn't grow grow up up po' po'
But once you get grown, and out on your own
Bills upon bills upon bills is what you have
Before you get your check then you already spend half
See, I make money, money doesn't make me
I'm a reflection of my section and my section 8"

As if they can't see the misery in which they live
Blame me for the outcome, ban my records – check it
Don't have to bump this, but please respect it
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
Turned it to a plus, now they stuck livin' blinded
Hennessy got me feelin' bad, time to stop drinkin'
Rollin' in my drop-top Jag, what's that cops thinkin'?
Sittin' in my car, watch the stars and smoke
I came a long way, but still I got so far to go

Tell Setchu that I love her, but it's hard today
I got the letter that she sent me, and I cried for weeks
This what came out when I tried to speak – all I heard was…"

Scared that some killer might fuck him in the ass
Staff getting rigid, wasn't gon' take away the visits
Segregate niggas by theyself and make 'em stay with it
Wicked, swung the shank around on a mop string
They had to pull him out the cell with a SWAT team
That's a cop team
They sent hella cops to stop, the helicopteriiiing...
Man, he'd thought that he'd fly away
Like a kite, take flight, like a letter on a string
Like propellers on a wing (but the kite was the key)
They made electric chairs for his dying days
Last meals, no appeals for him to try and stay
On Death Row like Suge and the late Pac
Maybe he could dig a tunnel outta A Block
And wear gloves for the razor-wired gate top
Scared thugs going crazy in a caged box
Looking at the world through the TV
And they gone, rapping over beats from the tabletops
Ay! That's how it is in a police state
When your life is just a number and release date
When you're rehabilitated so correctly
And let's hope that's how you're living when you're set free"

Neighbors look at every bag you bring through your doors
Lock the top lock, momma should've cuffed me to the radiator
Why not? It might've saved me later from my block
N.Y. cops, hookers crawlin' off the stroll, coughin'
Stitches in they head, stinkin' and I dread thinkin' they be snitchin'
But who else could it be?
Shook at these unmarked vans, parked in the dark
NARC's — where's your heart?
Hustlers starve, they bust a U-ey, I jog
To my building, come out later wearin' camouflage
See the sergeant and the captain strangle men
Niggas gaspin' for air 'til they move no more and just stare
With dead eyes, tired of riots, shit is quiet
Simple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews
Overcrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sisters pregnant
Fathers on drugs, moms is smokin', beds is piss-infested
Had eight partners growin' up, eight turned to seven
Seven turned to six niggas, got two in heaven
Six of us holdin' it, now it's five rollin' thick
The 6th one's parole flipped, five niggas went to four quick
When he went O.T., college life
Converted into gangbangin', four niggas still hangin'
Years passin' and slang changin'
Three of us now, 4th nigga ain't around
We all thought he was real, he did the snake shit, fake shit
Beat his ass down
Yo, his mouth could've got us all wasted, what a fuckin' clown
All I got left in the end is two of my best friends
And we all goin' out to the death for these ends!
What?!"

You ain't a chump, you want your Grandma to think you a punk

Bought me a house, diamonds, and a brand new car

Now on ATLiens, we was killing it
And then my auntie passed, she was like my mother, I was feeling it
The first person close to me to die, I needed healing
But I see her as an angel when I look up at the ceiling
Like my daddy and granddaddy on both shoulders steady chilling
So you got to keep on living like each day is the beginning
It's your birthday, even on your worst day
Live it like the first day, I'm Antwan Andre

And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night, for you in the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If Heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anythin'
Friends we'll stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family, love ain't simple
Why can't it be anythin' worth havin' you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine"

Common	22	Sum Shit I Wrote	Resurrection	1994	[Verse 3]	"My foundation is a black block of niggas that rock they hat cocked
I'm real like a fight with my rap, rappers I slapbox
Back I got my rap cocked get your Glock out the black face
Got tall flavor with fat taste, the rap race is a rat race
Just cause you got Adidas with the fat laces and the fro don't make you
Hip-hop
You sorry excuse for funk rap
Why is there so many cranks trying to rhyme, yo funk that
The real shit's starting to come back
The Go is where I'm from and where I'm at, jack
I started eating cat when I was 10
Before then I was getting big dog like Glenn Robinson
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
But comes a time when you gotta come off of that booty
The facts of life I didn't learn from watching Tootie
But living in the big city but I still like Tootie cause she got big titties
My style is steep, I rip rhymes on the incline
Splat guts bust fat nuts and lay up like a crip line
I'm slamming, jamming on the one
I'm a bad man, you're just a good son, come on"

And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so"
André 3000	27	13th Floor/Growing Old	ATLiens	1996	[Verse 3]	"Our dearly beloved, we are gathered like soap is to lather we come clean
Some issues need to be addressed like envelopes I mean
Oh, like Liberty Bells, yes them bullets keep on ringing
On fire like the Georgia Mass Choir, we keep on sanging
Bringing our folks closer together cause they severed us from the get green
Light and we ain't gon' stop until we hit the big screen
Psych, because no one is free when others are oppressed
So, we hit the stage and then we fly back to our nest
Growing old"

Used to grow up in the backwoods
Come take a ride with the real, it's the last of us
We gon' make them Vogue bitches turn racheter
First task, 'nihilate, you used to laugh at us
Pass the Actavis 'cause a nigga past passivist
Imagine my world of misogyny
Nigga, fuck a, fuck a monogamy
Got her head tipped over the driver's seat
Meet me, don't go tell my mama 'bout this, baby
Hold up, we gon' own the summer
Never, never stressin', no, we always hit the numbers
Cuzzo always stressin', always cuffin' different numbers
Know he tired of makin' shit, you know the streets don't make diplomas
Drunk somethin', tryna find my keys
I find myself lookin' down at the stars, the bees
The stars align, remember when it was Ramadan
Might try a line, might try some crime, might try to dime
But now it's time
Baby, now it's time, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na

Gamin' the hoochies at the neighborhood block parties
I remember, breakdancin' to Melle Mel
Jekyll and Hyde, LL when he Rocks the Bells

Be careful don't let the transit cops see me
It ain't nuttin' like the old school!"

Relocate, jump on the same G5
Checkin' for me heavy 'cause I go, yeah, I go, yeah
They never been ready, yeah, I know, yeah, know, yeah
100K spread across the floor, 'cross the floor, yeah
None of y'all fuckin' with the flow, yeah, the flow, yeah
Years in the makin', and don't y'all mistake it
I got 'em by a landslide, we talkin' about races
You know this'll never be a tie, just look at they laces
You know careers take off, just gotta be patient
Mr. One through Five, that's the only logic
Fake my death, go to Cuba, that's the only option"
Travis Scott	33	HYAENA	UTOPIA	2023	[Verse 2]	"Uh, yeah
C-notes, B-notes, I took the biggest boat
We stayed down for life, it's like a jingle to do 'em all
We too much involved to spend a single ounce of time
She bust a whole ounce by doin' lines
I had to leave, like the leaves do trees
I'm finally home, I wiped the stress, then I touched that sweat
We took 'em 35 to 1 like this shit roulette
Hold up, beg your pardon, we done lit up, baby
Set up, told the preacher, ""Never finish,"" that's to say the least
Buy it, never lease it, but I gotta lease it
Mobile, Mona type of pieces, Met Gala, night Jesus
Skip it, hit the city, party pack, I got it with me
I'm shotty while I let you with me
I'm too bent to let you ride, barely 'til it's empty
Gotta feel me, pockets dumb fat and I got a skinny
Squad is with me, and that's everything I know about it"

The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined (Uh-huh)
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine (Woo)
God's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines knowin' The Source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today, my phone'll stop ringin' again
These industry niggas ain't friends, they know how to pretend"

Child to raise

They do not want to hear it
Because they'd rather be bouncing and shooting
And killing and bouncing and shit, get down
Return of the gangsta, thanks ta'
Them niggas that think y'all soft and say y'all be gospel rappin'
But they be steady clappin' when you talk about
Bitches, and switches, and hoes, and clothes, and weed
Let's talk about time travelin', rhyme javelin
Somethin' mind unravelin', get down
Return of the gangsta, thanks ta'
Them niggas that got them kids
That got enough to buy an ounce
But not enough to bounce them kids to the zoo
Or to the park so they grow up in the dark
Never seein' light 'til they end up being like yo' sorry ass
Robbin' niggas in broad-ass daylight, get down
Return of the gangsta, thanks ta'
Them niggas who get the wrong impression of expression
Then the question is, Big Boi, what's up with Andre?
Is he in a cult? Is he on drugs? Is he gay?

I recognize your fragrance, hol' up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, it's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that
Pour up plenty of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range, I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari
Nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell

Say goodbye to the toasters and Pop-Tarts
Yo, it's real
Swallow a little pill, there's a four-course meal
Say hello to the one world
Say hello to the sky, something's out there watchin' you and I
More enticin' than Star Trek, StarTAC phones
Your genes and DNA is used to make clones
You got CD-Rom, everything operates by computers
Then what happens when circuit breaks?
Y2K's the big scare
Scientists say we ain't prepared
What I feel is contrare
Alexander Graham Bell made telephones, yes
But now we request for your e-mail address
I might be old fashioned, stuck in my ways
But nothin' make me more happier than seein' today"

Bein' down for the same team
What just seems to be reality is just a dream
Eye to eye, the colors that I wear is do or die
When I walk down the street, will I meet evil in disguise?
So, I tote a .44 wit' hollow tips
While my mind tellin' me 'Should I not?', or 'Should I pull it?'
What I represent, God only knows what lies for myself
Jealousy and hatred, niggas is out for my wealth
Will I perish? Livin' selfish for the rest of my life
'Cause those who live wrong is bound to live a short life
Will money be the root of my destruction?
Without the money, I can't even seem to function"
Eminem	15	Hello	Relapse	2009	[Verse 2]	"My equilibrium's off—must be the lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man—people give me 'em
It just becomes everyday, extra-curriculum
No reason in particular—it was strictly fun
A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151
Fifty-one people asleep in my damn living room
Excuse me, hun, but what is your name? Vivian?
I woke up next to you naked, and, uh, did we, um?
Of course, we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy, hun?
I'm looking for the torn wrapper, but there don't seem to be one
No offense, baby girl, I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
I find the package, and I'm cool—I immediately run
Like Speedy Gon-zales to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of 3's—I'm fiending for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum"

But I'mma go ahead to college like my father want me to""
Well um, off to my cell withcha body on my mind
And I'mma call you back tomorrow round the same time

On another phoneline, holla'n at my other ho
This bitch ain't sayin SHIT, cause the bitch ain't SHIT
Old fat golddiggin-ass county check receivin BEOTCH
I bail up in the Day Room and get in a scrap
Niggas watchin Soul Train and I wouldn't turn it back (man fuck y'all)
Never caught slippin, always on strap
And now I'm back in the hole with no motherfuckin get back
Sit back and contemplate, and think about baby
And hope she don't get caught up in the world that's so crazy
But while I'm up in Wayside, and she off in college
She gettin a little mo' than a schoolgirl knowledge
Cause gangsta-ass niggas go to school nowadays
I tried to make you wait, but I can't change yo' ways
She fell in love with the local G

Now as far as the hearing, I've found it
It was as far as the distance from the earring to the ground is
But the doorknockers on the ear
Of a stewardess in a Lear, she's fine and she's flying
I feel I'm flying by 'em, cause my mind's on cloud nine
And in a mine at the same time
Pimps see the wings on the Underground King
Who's also Klingon, to infinity and beyond
Something really stinks, but I Sphinx like Leon
Or lion in the desert
I'm flying on Pegasus, you're flying on a pheasant
Writer of the white powder, picker of the fire flowers
Spit, ""hot fiya"" like Dylan on Chappelle's skit
Yeah, smell it on my unicorn
Don't snort the white horse, but toot my own horn

Without the eight, right, maybe you could test my weight, right
I dip, spit quicker than you ever seen
Administer pain, next the minister's screamin' your name
At your wake as I peek in, look in your casket
Feelin' sarcastic, ""Look at him, still sleepin'""

V.I.P., my shit parked valet
On the prowl again to get honeys familiar with the smile again
Some try to assault Dre, its still cavi
I'm eatin' steak while they struggle to break the slave mentality
I givin' livin' definition long as my hearts tickin'
I fought and made the world listen
Whatever flop Dr. Dre invented?
Turn on the box and let my son watch these studio clowns on 60 inches

And my plan is, not to leave this town 'til I'm rich
Gotta find a nigga selling all them ounces and shit
Tell them get down with the clique or get found in a ditch
See I drop down and strip, I turn around and spit
Not to hit em, just to let 'em know the sound of shit
Return later that evening in the club with Fox
And I got the snub nose for those that love to box
I'm in search of them young niggas that hug the block
All day, 'til it's light gray outside
Shoot dice talking shit all day outside
And even when it's hot, they outside
Let em know how its gonna go, Bonnie and Clyde
And ayo, you would want me on your side"
Common	22	Retrospect for Life	One Day It’ll All Make Sense	1997	[Verse 2]	"Seeing you as a present and a gift in itself
You had our child in you, I probably never feel what you felt
But you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are
Through our trials and tribulations, child's elimination
An integration of thoughts I feel about the situation
Back and forth, my feelings was pacin'
Happy deep down, but not joyed enough to have it
But even that's a lie, in less than two weeks we was back at it
Is this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust?
Bustin', more than the sweat in somebody you trust
Or is it that we don't trust each other enough?
And believe, havin' this child'll make us have to stay together
Girl, I want you in my life 'cause you have made it better
Thinkin' we all in love 'cause we can spend a day together
We talkin' spendin' the rest of our lives
It's too many black women that can say they mothers, but can't say that they wives
I wouldn't choose any other to mother my understanding
But I want our parenthood to come from planning
It's so much in my life that's undone
We gotta see eye to eye about family, before we can become one
If you had decided to have it, the situation I wouldn't run from
But I'm walkin', findin' myself in my God
So I can, discipline my son with my rod
Not have a judge tellin' me how and when to raise my seed
Though his death was at our greed, with no one else to blame
I had a book of African names, case our minds changed
You say your period hasn't came, and lately I've been sleepy
So quit smokin' the weed and the beadies and let's have this boy"

Low on energy, find peach cobbler then gobble it, yeah

Blinking gradually quickens 'til they isn't here

Kanye West	5	All of the Lights	My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy	2010	[Verse 2]	"Restraining order, can't see my daughter
Her mother, brother, grandmother hate me in that order
Public visitation, we met at Borders
Told her she take me back, I'll be more supportive
I made mistakes, I bumped my head
Them courts sucked me dry, I spent that bread
She need her daddy, baby, please
Can't let her grow up in that ghetto university"
Common	22	So Cool	Be	2005	[Verse 1]	"I was rose in a city where the blood is cold
Big hats, Cadillacs, and we loves the gold
Looking for something real, something pretty to hold

Then, I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check—wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah, I stole—never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Asking me about some khakis
But let some Black people walk in
I bet you they show off their token blackie
Oh, now they love Kanye
""Let's put him all in the front of the store""
So I'm on break
Next to the ""No Smoking"" sign with a blunt in the mall
Taking my hits, writing my hits
Writing my rhymes, playing my mind
This fucking job can't help him
So I quit; y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love, dude
Lock yourself in a room
Doing five beats a day for three summers
That's A Different World like Cree Summer's
I deserve to do these numbers
""The kid that made that deserves that Maybach!""
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow!"

I been gone away from home for so long
Seems like everything I try to do without you go wrong
I'm confused about a lot of things, but not with my faith
So I'm depending on your holy ghost to guide me the way
See, I'm a sinner in the third degree
Ain't afraid to admit it, 'cause I seen niggas worse than me
Who am I to judge a man when I'm a man myself
In the dark, trying to get me some help?
I went from pawn to king, king back to pawn
Doing my best to try to ease out the storm
I know that every tunnel's got an end and a light
And I prepared a new beginning in Christ
My life is like a jigsaw dulling in time
And as I'm thumbing through this jigsaw puzzle of mine"

All of my whoadies coyotes, we stickin' together, we comin' like shottas
Put a tracker on that bitch if you love her, 'cause she comin' through like a goon squad

Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better 'cause instead of you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops

Runnin' and duckin' out the Hot Rocks parking lot

While you fidget, you could get killed for your digits
I'll creep on the low, keep it a secret yo
I swore an oath to dump on you, out the Jeep window
I don't care if you a geek or a thug, you sleepin' on us
And you could catch it, some royal heat from the snub
Since the streets is watchin' niggas might see us often
We told you rap cats we would keep it poppin'
See all I got is a lot of bad news for y'all
You're gonna need more than a lot of tattoos on y'all
You got an army, you still ain't got no wins against us

Eric B. & Rakim	14	My Melody	Paid in Full	1986	[Verse 2]	"So what? I'm a microphone fiend, addicted soon as I seen
One of these four emcees so they don't have to scream
I couldn't wait to take the mic, blow into it to test
Then let my melody play, then the record suggest
That I'm dropping bombs, but I stay peace and calm
Any MC that disagree with me, wave your arm
And I'll break, when I'm through breaking, I'll leave you broke
Drop the mic when I'm finished and watch it smoke
So stand back, you wanna rap, all of that can wait
I won't push, I won't beat around the bush
I wanna break upon those who are not supposed to
You might try, but you can't get close to
Because I'm number one, competition is none
I'm measured with the heat that's made by sun
Whether playing ball or bobbing in the hall
Or just writing my name in graffiti on the wall
They shouldn't have told me you said you control me
So now a contest is what you owe me
Pull out your money, pull out your cut
Pull up a chair...
My name is Rakim Allah, and R and A stands for ""Ra""
Switch it around, it still comes out ""R""
So easily will I E-M-C-E-E
A repetition of words, just check out my melody
Some bass and treble is moist, scratching and cutting a voice
And when it's mine that's when the rhyme is always choice
I wouldn't have came to set my name and run the same weak sh—
Putting blurs and slurs and words that don't fit in a rhyme
Why waste time on the microphone?
I take this more serious than just a poem
Rock from party to party, backyard to yard
Now tear it up, y'all, and bless the mic for the gods"

I'll find a way out, yeah, I would if I could
But the government is doing a project
So I live in the projects
Where we fight for elbow room to the doom
Try to live long but you die too soon
I might not be alive to see 25
Taught at ten to make money and strive
I sold tapes at school and made some ends
Met alot of skins and even made some friends
Cool, 'cause now I got a crew to run with
Break a couple of rules, have crazy fun with
But every now and then, they give my knuckle game a test
But I won't fess, I just get rid of the stress
And then shake hands like a man
'Cause it's a family thing, only the crew would understand
But you had a one on one fight with drugs
When we ain't cool no more, we bust slugs
Clip after clip, until one of us is gone
(Hey bruh) what's going on?"

Eyes light green penetratin' the moonlight
Hair done in a bun, energy in the room like
Big Bang for theory, God, hopin' you hear me
Phone off the ringer, tell the world, ""I'm busy""
Fair enough, green-eyes said her mother didn't care enough
Sympathize when her daddy in the chain gang
Her first brother got killed, he was twenty-one
I was nine when they put Lamont in the grave
Heartbroken when Estelle didn't say goodbye
Chad left his body after we FaceTimed

Yeah, that tuxedo might have been a little guido
But with my ego, I can stand there in a Speedo
And be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory, the story, the chain, the polo, the night
The grind, the empty bottles of No-Doz
Tank on empty, whipping my momma Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes, shit that you don't floss
The Goyard so hard, man, I'm Hugo's boss
Why I gotta ask what that TUDOR cost?
House on the hill, two doors from Tracee Ross
And I'm asking 'bout her girlfriends, yeah, the dark skin'ed ones
She asking 'bout the speed boats, yeah, I admit we rented 'em
When you meet me in person, what do you feel like?
I know, I know, I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You know, B.I.G. and Pac, you know to get it hot
I guess after I live, I wanna be compared to B.I.G

You beef with me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
'Cause when I smoke out, I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Oh no) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin' tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out (C'mere) his blond dreads (Fuck you)

Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people
And drink, jump behind the wheel like it was still legal

Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill

But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white? I don't even exist

And me and you together, baby, we a lucky pair
It's been a long time, we walked a thin line
Others say they got you, but you been mine
As I sit back and watch all the catfights
Domestic violence — is that right?
But you love the Dogg, gave me the spotlight
And now I'm growin' up, showin' up, blowin' up

Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy, disillusioned lately
I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady, don't trust my lady
'Cause she's a product of this poison

Just like a baby: all alone— that's if you wasn't a twin
You must begin to fend for self when the umbilical's cut
The doctor put you under the heating l your spirit is touched
You know what? I take that back (Why?) You was alive
Date of conception, interception, 'cause the sperm did collide
From T 'n' A to DNA, feelings turn to chil'en's
The morning after pill didn't put a halt to our very existence
We living; breathing; soon, we'll be teethin
Our granny got a gold, and now, we want one for that reason
An adolescent mind is so impressionable in those stages, but
Parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages
Cell therapists, beware of this loogie that I spit:
Incarceration without rehabilitation really don't mean shit

But Uncle Darnell and Ol' Dirty Bastard still in the joint"

Rakim	10	I Know	The Master	1999	[Verse 3]	"The editor, forevermore the predator
I set it off, spread a war like never before
Spit literatures like a ghetto braud raw to cause ?
'till menopause
With raw metaphors, I set it off
But I just begun the best is yet to come
Blessed with a majestic tongue since I was young
But I was stressed for funds and obsessed with guns
Test the one, let Allah protect your son
Cause I'm the musical magician, the Asiatic author
The microphone magician when I have a magic marker, a mentor
You can explore, every sentence is a tour
The inventor is more than adventure
You'll be blown away, in the zone when it play
It's so ill, I still grab the microphone and say
One of my own displays like I'm known to blaze
And I bet rhyme pays until I'm old and gray"
Future	30	Freak Hoe	DS2	2015	[Chorus]	"Freak hoes, freak hoes
Bounce that ass, make your knees touch your elbows

Lay it down, niggas kickin' in your front door
Freak hoes, freak hoes
Bounce that ass, make your knees touch your elbows
Freak hoes, freak hoes
Bounce that ass, make your knees touch your elbows

André 3000	27	Liberation	Aquemini	1998	[Verse 1]	"There's a— there's a— there's a— there's a fine line
Too late, but baby, I'm on it, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yo, yo, uh-huh)
There's a fine line between love and hate, you see
Came way too late but, baby, I'm on it
There's a fine line between love and hate, you see
Came way too late but, baby, I'm on it
Can't worry 'bout what a nigga think
Now see, that's liberation and, baby, I want it
Can't worry 'bout what another nigga think
Now that's liberation and, baby, I want it

Scarface	11	What Can I Do?	The Fix	2002	[Verse 1]	"I thank the Lord, for every morning, he allows me to rise
And though the sun is shining, there's a cloud in the sky
Lettin' me know, that at any moment, there could be rain
And as beautiful as life is, there still can be pain
Down the park, I hear the sirens, just a screamin' away
And then the inevitable happens, the end of them days
As sad as it sounds, but that's the price we all gotta pay
And the whole world knows God giveth, will taketh away (will taketh away)
I live and I learn, I sit and watch my cigarette burn
Down to the ash, it reminds me of the now and the past
I say me a prayer, cause eventually I'll stand in the path
Of the souls and dark roads that lead to rest"

Ha, whoa!"
Big L	25	Games	The Big Picture	2000	[Verse 1]	"Check it, a year ago, I did a show for some dough
Puffed a bag of hydro, then broke out on the low
And on my way out, it was a female on my trail
Who followed me from the stage to the Benz SL
I asked honey her name, she replied, Monique
Soft and sweet, from her head to feet, hotter than heat
Jump in the passenger seat, let's go get something to eat
She said I was that Roc-a-Fella she'd been dying to meet
I tried to hit it first night, she said she wasn't a freak
Yeah right, it's all good, so I waited a week
Then one night to my crib she decided to creep
Knocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep
I let her in before you know it, we was doing our thang
I drove her home, and said tomorrow give me a ring
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
With some bogus ass story that was off the wall
Claiming she's pregnant with my child, I think that's quite foul
How is that, I wore a Lifestyle"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Go Baby	Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool	2007	[Pre-Chorus]	"Where my ladies at?
I said where my ladies at?
Let's find somewhere we can go crazy at
And for you baby I'll be your maniac
Hey hey hey hey
And you don't have to worry 'bout nothing
Cause every time I see you baby you'll be rolling with me
Oh I'll be on the sidelines rooting for my dime
Holding up my sign and it say"
50 Cent	19	P.I.M.P. Remix	Get Rich or Die Tryin’	2003	[Chorus]	"I don't know what you heard about me

No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

Rakim	10	Real Shit	The Master	1999	[Verse 1]	"This is that lost abstract off the rack kind of a track
You forced to rap, remember that? It's that
You know where I'm at, there go the gat
Pass me a bat, the kill-or-be-killed kind of attack
Steamin' the sack, speedin' navigatin' the map
Negotiating with a chick, she got her head on your lap
Ya hand on your gat premeditated plan of attack
With two of your most deadliest mens in the back
Comb the block, stop in the zone that's hot
Get out like you own the spot, home or not
It's that no mood to play, move out the my way
Yo, I been whistlin' this tune from throughout the day
Hey, yo, this is that ol' y'all niggas don't wanna battle
Turn it up loud make the whole block rattle
Boom boom- this one is gettin' crazy hot
Boom boom- make you bust another shot from the Glock"
Havoc	7	The Set Up	It Was Written	1996	[Chorus]	"Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo, it's do or die

Lift you up, bless you with a shorty then we set you up"
Future	30	We Don’t Trust You	WE DON’T TRUST YOU	2024	[Verse 1]	"I been in the cold, couldn't feel my toes, but I still stuck to the code
Money won't fold, pockets won't hold enough
Takin' my pole in there, F&N in there
Take me anywhere, I'm takin' over the trap
I see the real clear, woodgrain Cartier
Poppin' a real pill, higher than Beverly Hills
I got too much spill, I give a bitch chills
Took out a small bill, make all the hoes strip
You need a weed feel, I get it vacuum sealed
Came from the Eastside, shooters on detail
Go purchase a new Chanel, I need a refill
Strikers in Trackhawks, ridin' the V12
I peeped the mood, dog, I peeped the intel
Get to trippin', all you gon' see is shells"
Nas	9	Every Ghetto	Stillmatic	2001	[Verse 3]	"My skin is a art gallery, right, with paintings of crucifixes
Hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business
Was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders
But since I tasted paper it started losin' the friendships
Watchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor
How could I tease them with Benzes and feel no remorse?
Drivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin'
Red stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones
Fuck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex
And spendin' time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des?
Got guns when I'm with my daughter
Hate to bring a violent aura in her presence
She know what daddy taught her, it's lessons
Black princess, it's a ugly world
I put my life up for yours, see I love that girl
Could you believe even my shadow's jealous?
My skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones
My brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs
Though my songs come from the Father
I'm lonely, hold me, it's gettin' darker"
Kendrick Lamar	16	m.A.A.d city	good kid, m.A.A.d city	2012	[Verse 3]	"If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust, what?"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	Follow the Leader	Follow the Leader	1988	[Verse 1]	"Follow me into a solo, get in the flow
And you can picture like a photo
Music mix, mellow maintains to make
Melodies for emcees, motivates the breaks
I'm everlasting, I can go on for days and days
With rhyme displays that engrave deep as x-rays
I can take a phrase that's rarely heard
Flip it, now it's a daily word
I can get iller than 'Nam, I kill and bomb
But no alarm, Rakim'll remain calm
Self-esteem makes me super, superb and supreme
But for a microphone, still I fiend
This was a tape, I wasn't supposed to break
I was supposed to wait, but let's motivate
I wanna see you keep following and swallowing
Taking and making, biting and borrowing
Brothers tried and others died to get the formula
But I'ma let you sweat, you still ain't warm, you a
Step away from frozen, stiff as if you're posing
Dig into my brain as the rhyme gets chosen
So follow me and while you're thinking you were first
Let's travel at magnificent speeds around the universe
What could you say as the Earth gets further and further away?
Planets as small as balls of clay
Astray into the Milky Way, world's out of sight
Far as the eye can see, not even a satellite
Now stop and turn around and look
As you stare in the darkness, your knowledge is took
So keep staring, soon you suddenly see a star
You better follow it 'cause it's the R
This is a lesson if you're guessing and if you're borrowing
Hurry, hurry, step right up and keep following the leader
Follow the leader
Rakim'll say
Follow the leader
Rakim'll say
Follow the leader
Rakim'll say
Follow the leader (Keep following)
Rakim'll say
Follow the leader
Rakim'll say
Follow the leader
Rakim'll say
Follow the leader
Rakim'll say
Follow the leader"

Where the homies not doin' it right
I mean he found him a ho that he like
But you can't make a ho a housewife

You heard the talk around town I don't need shit
Compton! Deep water got 'em seasick
Murder, murder shit and ain't nobody see shit
Bomb weed, palm tree, gold D shit
Who that nigga that said I wasn't gon' be shit?
Cocktail through the window with the indo

(We) Do what we wanna when we want to
(And we) Never hesitated to confront you

It was normal to us, it might take you

'Cause more guns will come and much more will die
Why? Yo, I don't know, black
Some motherfuckers just be living like that
They like to feel the chrome in their hands
The shit makes 'em feel like little big man
Twelve years old, catching wreck
'Cause there ain't no supervision puttin' kids in check
People get wounded, others, they perish
And what about the mother and the child she cherish?
The city's wild, up steps the wild child
Tension, anger, living in danger
What the fuck you gonna do in a situation?
It's like you need to have steel just to feel relaxation
Tons o' guns"
The Game	13	Don’t Need Your Love	The Documentary	2005	[Verse 3]	"I was gassed up, Murder Inc., Roc-A-Fella passed up
Sat in Daddy's House with Black Rob and Lou and asked Puff
Now The Game's set in stone, the Franck Muller's set in stones
Dre cut me a check, I'm gone
Tryin' to be the king of the streets, niggas'll wet your throne
But I got nieces to feed, two coasts to please
So I roam through the city like the ghost of E
Gotta put Compton back where it's 'sposed to be
Nuthin' between all my niggas that's close to me
In the streets with two fellas packin' toast for me
I'm 'posed to be, got all the critics watchin' my pivot
On my block in the Coupe readin' kites from prison
I got niggas doing life in prison
All my fallen soldiers is one of the reasons we pour out liquor
So this song is for Ms. Wallace, Afeni Shakur
And all the mothers of dead sons that went out in the war"
Snoop Dogg	0	California Vacation	Doctor’s Advocate	2006	[Chorus]	"My heart beat for the West

2Pac	18	Blasphemy	The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory	1996	[Verse 1]	"My family tree consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers
Strugglin', known to hustle, screamin', ""Fuck their feelings!""
I got advice from my father, all he told me was this:
""Nigga, get off your ass if you plan to be rich!
There's ten rules to the game, but I'll share with you two
Know niggas gon' hate you for whatever you do
Now, rule one: get your cash on, M.O.B.
That's Money Over Bitches, 'cause they breed envy
Now, rule two is a hard one: watch for phonies
Keep your enemies close, nigga, watch your homies""
It seemed a little unimportant, when he told me, I smiled
Picture jewels bein' handed to an innocent child
I never knew, in my lifetime, I'd live by these rules
Initiated as an Outlaw, studyin' rules
Now, papa ain't around, so I gotta recall
Or come to grips with bein' written on my enemy's walls
Promise if I have a seed, I'ma guide him right
Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight
I got words for my comrades, listen and learn
Ain't nothin' free, get back what you earned
No doubt, gettin' higher than a motherfucker, bless me, please
This Thug Life'll be the death of me
Come on, yeah"

No tricks in '86, it's time to build
Eric be easy on the cut, no mistakes allowed
'Cause to me, MC means move the crowd
I made it easy to dance to this
But can you detect what's coming next from the flex of the wrist?
Say indeed and I'll proceed 'cause my man made a mix
If he bleed, he won't need no Band-Aid to fix
His fingertips, so I rhyme until there's no rhymes left
I hurry up, because the cut will make 'em bleed to death
But he's kicking it 'cause it ain't no half stepping
The party is live, the rhyme can't be kept in-
Side of me, erupting just like a volcano
It ain't the everyday style or the same old rhyme
'Cause I'm better than the rest of them
Eric B. is on the cut and my name is Rakim"

We used to hustle in the hood for all to see
Problems; I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Let him unlock doors off my keys
Yeah, we spoke, much more than cordially
Man, he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint 'til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
He's talkin' reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said: ""Damn, dog! What, nine weeks and you're home?""
He said: ""Main man, you think shit's sweet 'cause you're home.""
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
Them crackers up there bleachin' your dome, you're reachin'
I said: ""The world don't stop, I got to keep, keep on.""
From there I sensed the beef was on
I ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
Can't be too safe, ‘cause niggas is two-faced
And they show the other side, when they catch a new case
It's on"

Everything he sees, he absorbs and adopts it
Mmm, he mimics and he mocks it
Really hates the box, but he can't remember how to stop it
Uh, so he continues to watch it
Hoping that it'll give him something that he can box with
Or how to locksmith, see, the box is locked in a box
Ain't got the combination to unlock it
That's why he watches, scared to look away
'Cause at that moment, it might show him
What to take off the locks with"

Common	22	Maintaining	Resurrection	1994	[Verse 2]	"I need me some new socks (uhh), I need me some new drawers
I draws attention, like a letter to a sergeant
There's a few good emcees, the wack I'm giving code red
Slim say I ain't got no body, but when they see me at the party
They be like, ""Go 'head, go 'head""
'Cause I got's the cuts like Bobbitt, rappers are dickheads
Shoppin' they demo, I do 'em like Big Red
My office hours are from 9 to 5
While you avoid the party I make it live
The fellas nod and the chicks dance
While I'm coolin' in my jumpers and my big pants
I'm as dope as PCP; MC's see me and they start having flashbacks
I don't flash scratch, I gotta watch my back
Nowadays blacks don't know how to act
Besides Larry Fishburne, Charles Dutton, and Wesley Snipes
Marks wanna test me because I test the mics
But I check 'em like sound, and like Goose, I'm down
Plus I done got better since ""Soul by the Pound""; I'm maintaining"
Kanye West	5	Waves	The Life of Pablo	2016	[Verse 1]	"Step up in this bitch like (Turn it up!)
I'm the one your bitch like
Yeah, I'm the one your bitch like (Turn it up!)
And I be talkin' shit like
I ain't scared to lose a fistfight (Turn it up!)
And she grabbin' on my, like
She wanna see if it'll fit right
That's just the wave (Turn it up!)"
2Pac	18	Papa’z Song	Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...	1993	[Verse 2]	"That's when I started hatin' the phony smiles
Said I was an only child"
JAY-Z	6	Public Service Announcement	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 1]	"Allow me to re-introduce myself
My name is Hov, oh, H to the O-V
I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z
I guess even back then you can call me
CEO of the R-O-C, Hov
Fresh out the fryin' pan into the fire
I be the music biz number one supplier
Flyer than a piece of paper bearin' my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin' my chain, that's right
Hov, oh, not D.O.C.
But similar to them letters, ""No One Can Do It Better""
I check cheddar like a food inspector
My homie Strict told me, ""Dude, finish your breakfast""
So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude with the Lexus
Fast-forward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
I shoot at you actors like movie directors
This ain't a movie, dog (Oh, shit)"
Guru	20	Sabotage	The Ownerz	2003	[Verse 2]	"Treachery, deception, it's best to keep a weapon
When you think that they be breddren, they underhand your plan
It's over for the cowardly, we grow more potent hourly
I'm knowin' where the power be, I'm schemin' to get even
Dissension can occur from within one's ranks
The chain can be weakened, by just one link
Pricks be galavantin' from one crew to the next
Musical click-ass niggas catch two to the chest
My usual guess is that they choose to digress
Disillusioned by greed, causin' you to distress
Just do what's best, clean house, leave out
Them punks can't touch what they can't peep out
See I'm a raw nigga, and like my pops I'm a lawgiver
Can't throw a wrench in my game, I'm a boss figure
Take you under my wing, it don't matter God
Dead you if you try to commit, sabotage
Rise for me now, kneel for me now
Time to pass judgment, can't feel for you now
Lay in your bed, accept your fate
Try to clean it up, accept you're late
From the streets to the industry, peep the chemistry
It's Gang Starr shit, makin' a livin' see
We put it on and when it's war it's war
Sabotage'll have me dumpin' the four {*gunshots richochet*}"
Scarface	11	One	The Diary	1994	[Chorus]	"One (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)
Three (Go to Joe's and pick up a dime)
And four of the finest bitches that your ass can find
Can you, one (Bring your boy a bottle of wine)
Two (Don't forget the papers this time)

And four of the finest bitches that your ass can find"

Rakim	10	All Night Long	The Master	1999	[Verse 1]	"I'm back, the god remains, still at the end
They sabotage the game, still I'm a win
Rakim Allah's the name, ill with a pen
No one can dodge the rain, kill' em again
In a club or the streets I swerve, cool in the cut
Looking to see what occurs, cruisin' the truck
Shorty got deadly curves, soothin' her up
If I must explain with words, I smooth as a fuck!
The world's most greatest hip-hop's elite
You obsolete, you cannot compete, drop the beat
Keep ya ear to the ground when I rock the street
Cock the heat, we deep papi got to eat
So cut on the mic and spit, I'm much rougher
Plenty of ice and a whip, and plus a crusher
Because I don't like to stick, or bust a brother
Long as they never forget I'm a ill motherfucker"
Common	22	Making a Name for Ourselves	One Day It’ll All Make Sense	1997	[Verse 3]	"I pursue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair
Other nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs
On knots I landed, players get played like Hamlet
Supposedly nice, taken for granted like life
I write twice and drop singles in record pools
Niggas I'm dunkin' like when cops mingle
Fuck hip-hop jingles! Rhymin' big words and not sayin' shit
The clique that you came in with, accents you flavor with
Like moose, I go to the caves and get niggas off all fours
I'm the shit that's uncalled for, the shit that you fall for
Far more advanced
Than a rapper whose career you could only take a glance
Couldn't make the transition from B-boy to C-note stance
I stand in a circumference of humbleness
But in the Chi rumble, it's mistaken as a weakness
When poetry's in motion, like a picture, I'm the main feature
Amongst hard-workin' teachers and corrupt preachers
I make my livin' off of singles like Latifah
In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses
You couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence
I'm cold with numb intentions"
50 Cent	19	Just a Lil Bit	The Massacre	2005	[Chorus]	"All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot, baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, in a lil' bit"
Nas	9	I Want to Talk to You	I Am...	1999	[Chorus]	"I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president
I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin' congressman
I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president
I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin' congressman
Can I talk to ya?"
2Pac	18	Point the Finga	Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...	1993	[Verse 3]	"One two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
I bring skills and I build, kill at will
Smoke sess til I'm ill, still feel me?
I say one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
Pick it up, pick it up, give it up
Best to duck or get fucked for your bucks
Scream one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
I can't give up, it's a black thang
And I ain't goin back to the crack game
(You can do it son; be a man and stand up or run)
Bitches, let 'em point the finga
(You can do it son; be a man and stand up or run)
Snitches, let 'em point the finga
Yo, one two three, peace to my real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
I guess nobody loves a rap singer
That's why these motherfuckers...(hahaha!) point the finga"
Scarface	11	Someday	The Fix	2002	[Verse 3]	"Lord, I know that I've been wrong
They say a man is lost without a prayer, without a song
So I'm singing on my knees 'cause I believe you'll keep me strong
Until it's time for me to bring it home
But until it's time for me to bring it home
I'll be out in these streets, hanging in the hood
Even gangsters need to pray, 'cause when I pray it's understood
That I got flaws about myself, I can't make it by myself
I need the Heaven's help, I want to follow in your foot steps
Done seen the strongest man bow down to a higher power
And given all his glory to God 'cause God towers
Over all, and in that I save this prayer
For all my homies that's been trapped out there
That's stuck in their ways, it's different now than back in the days
So fuck what they say, 'cause ain't no coming back from the grave
So when the gun goes pop and the lights go out
Then you'll understand what I'm talking about"
Snoop Dogg	0	Hourglass	Paid Tha Cost To Be Da Bo$$	2002	[Verse 1]	"Wiggle it round c'mon down
Doggy-d-o-double's in town
I know you wanna get down
So why you lookin' at me like that
Bitch break that shit down
I wanna make your kitty cat growl
I wanna hit it get it right now
So what you playin' with it for
Back it up slow move it around and dance to the flow
Now put your hands on the floor (c'mon)
C'mon on and gimme some more
It's crazy but baby think that maybe we gonna fuck in her man's mercedes
Bitch I ain't that loco
Fuckin' with a broke ho
Get a nigga smoked tho, no-no, na-na, nae-nae
She got a whole bunch of kids like Bebe
Listen what the pimpin say"
Guru	20	Make ’Em Pay	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 1]	"First and foremost, some rappers are sweet like fructose
When I cock back these lyrics, y'all punks best be ghost
I be the seven twenty-one, eighteen twenty-one
The illest one, I'm almost doper than anyone
Straight out the late nights of Bed-Stuy
Stepping up, y'all put your weapons up, I make heads fly
You're artificial like saccharin
You're crazy fake, it's more than skills you be lacking in
Concepts you bite, cause your identity ain't tight
Trying to be something you're not, like pulling a knife at a gunfight
I'm trooping on night air like flight number 106
And getting all up in your fucking mix
You got me upset, and I got you uptight
Cause my committee's in your city tonight, aight?
We got seventeen million of us plus, two million Indians
That makes 19 mil, lighting shit up like Wild Bill
I be the, supreme father plus the ill kid, with drama
My karma, creates the Teflon to pierce your body armor
And make sure you check the shit before you walk to me, or talk to me
Stepping to me improperly, you just may catch the weaponry
My specialty is tearing tracks out the frame
You know my fucking name, I rule all game
I'm universal on all planes, what's your claim?"
JAY-Z	6	Song Cry	The Blueprint	2002	[Chorus]	"I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry, uh
Can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Chapter Six	Section.80	2011	[Interlude]	"I'm glad we was able to talk about her vice and her evils
There is an even more important topic I'd like to discuss
The dysfunctional bastards of the Ronald Reagan era
Young men that learned to do everything spiteful
This is your generation
Live fast and die young
Who's willing to explain this story?"
Future & Metro Boomin	32	GTA	WE DON’T TRUST YOU	2024	[Verse 2]	"Hemi, Trackhawk, Scat Pack, dash
458 Ferrari, drivin' it fast
Trappin' is a hobby, you ain't gotta ask
Turned her to a Barbie, spoilin' her like a brat
Punch sodas, woo, pour my Tus' for me, baby
Puttin' the motor in the truck, then I go crazy
Loaded up on new ice, yeah, load up on new car
Workin' it out of the 'partments, nigga, trappin', servin' hard
Young niggas campin' outside, sleepin' in your yard
Coppin' a bigger house, forty car garage
See what hustlin' get you when you goin' against the odd?
No cappin', I'm taxin', wrappin' up a bale
What kind of ice, that's a chandelier
My earrings blindin' me when I look in the mirror"
Eminem	15	The Real Slim Shady	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Verse 1]	"Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said
Nothing, you idiots, Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha-ha)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka-chicka-chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who"", ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade they've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals
Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Hi-Definition	Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool	2007	[Verse 2]	"And in my flyness, I've become the hero and the sidekick
The rider and the nigga that'll ride with
In your ear like the maker of the ""Vivrant""
Assalamu Alaikum to the maker of the ""Vivrant""
Them other niggas I don't vibe with
Now I was 'bout three when the eyes went
But I could see everything that you trying to be
You can't hide it
While you coming out your throat like a Heimlich
I came up out the belly like an Hype script
Only my circumstance revised it
Hijacked the role and went and shot the pilot
I'm trying to go public so I can get to private
Then send Busy to go and get the pirates
Then hit Africa, try to fix the virus
Go back to the hood, tell Huggy, ""Open the hydrants""
R.I.P Stack B., I'ma keep you alive, kid
Dressed in something so fresh and wonderful
F-N-F and S-N double O-P"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Auntie Diaries	Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers	2022	[Verse 2]	"My auntie is a man now
I think I'm old enough to understand now
Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Back when it was comedic relief to say, ""Faggot""
""Faggot, faggot, faggot,"" we ain't know no better
Elementary kids with no filter, however
My auntie became a man and I took pride in it
She wasn't gay, she ate pussy, and that was the difference
That's what I told my friends in second grade
She picking me up from school, they stare at her in the face
They couldn't comprehend what I grew accustomed
We pull off bumpin' Quik like it was nothing
My auntie is a man now, what a relationship
I grew up fast, I needed no one to babysit
He gave me some cash then gave me some game
Cherry freshener on the dash, I never complained
She even cut my hair at the pad, was loving my fade
The first person I seen write a rap
That's when my life had changed
House full of demo, smoke stuck on the window
Cameras on the microphone, all women and men know
My auntie was a man now, we cool with it
The history had trickled down and made us ign'ant
My favorite cousin said he's returning the favor
And following my auntie with the same behavior"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Go Baby	Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool	2007	[Verse 1]	"There my lady at
I said there my lady at
That's my honey if I give her money she ain't gotta pay me back
No you ain't gotta pay me back
Hey hey hey hey
And I'll forever give you my love cuz
When I'm down you always put a smile on me
And when all of my strength's up, and I'm 'bout to give up
And I need a lift up, I hear her say"
Havoc	7	Drink Away the Pain (Situations)	The Infamous	1995	[Verse 3]	"My man P put me on to the shorty Henn Rock
Now, Henn Rock is strong enough to make your heartbeat stop
One sip, I thought the bitch was a fuckin' warlock
The more she started givin' me, the stronger I got
Pushed her off to the crew, then she started gettin' jealous
Steamed 'cause I spent more C.R.E.A.M. with the fellas
""Fuck them niggas! Spend that cheese on me
See if they be around when you need pussy""
Then I thought to myself, ""Yo, this trick is right!""
Gathered up all my dough, so I spent the night
I can't help it, she got my brain in a headlock
Niggas started riffin', ""Why you trickin'? Yo, this shit must stop!""
Moms like ""You need to see the AA
Better hope they help your ass out on the same day""
But never that, I got the shakes so I need that
Son call me stressed out, I just be that
But when it comes to Henn Rock, dunn, I need that
She's my shorty for life, so fuck the feedback"
The Game	13	Let’s Ride	Doctor’s Advocate	2006	[Chorus]	"(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)
Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back
(I turn it into a strip-club)
Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass
(If I could fit the hole world in the club)
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch
(Pop bottles and twist up)
Roll up chronic and hash
In a blunt, call it Aftermath"
Travis Scott	33	lose	Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight	2016	[Pre-Chorus]	"My Lambo gon' skrrt, my crib ain't got service
I got shit to lose, that shit make me nervous
I got shit to lose, gotta keep my cool
Gotta watch the dupes, can't let them come through
I got shit to lose
Hold up, wait, more to gain, more at stake
I got shit to do
Had to move, with the crew, away from you"
Eminem	15	Bad Guy	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 2]	"And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped? Shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone but he's not forgotten
And don't think 'cause he's been out the picture so long that I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him's same shit you did to me, cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee, who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on ya
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh"
Rakim	10	Finest Ones	The Master	1999	[Verse 1]	"I got rhymes I love to bust, looking for a club to rush
It's like thugs will rush the illustrious
We all love to touch the voluptuous
It's a must that we lust, plus we love to crush
Women pose, from Timberland's to feminine clothes
Check there portfolios and put 'em in centerfolds
Pen explode, draw crowds respond with yells
I stay calm as hell surrounded by bombshells
Careful as I get near 'em, stand near and compare 'em
Or all girl harem, I'm the man with the serum
Assets, probably dressed but still bear 'em
It seem like they wear 'em, just for me to tear 'em
In quakes, I see more things shake then spring break
It's like a dream state, perfect shape same date
You got a lot to give and look how hot it is
You so provocative and it's your prerogative
Baby, bounce"

Drop up some violence because they asked me to end this
Some trouble that I caught 'cause I was noisy
A nigga tried to take advantage because of the kamikaze
He took a swing for my head, thought I was faded
Started running for the door but the fucker never made it
The sound of the nine went ""Bang!""
And all over the wall was his motherfucking brain
'Cause I'm a nigga you can't sleep on
So set the alarm 'cause I hit like a motherfucking bomb
I do damage with the nine in my hand
But the average nigga that don’t know me don’t understand
I'm from the streets, so therefore
You know I don't care for a sucker that ain't down
With the real niggas, the niggas, the niggas
Yo, and that's the way shit gotta go ain't even sober
Any time that the nine wanna leave
I got a .38 hidden up the sleeve
And it's ready to go to war 'cause that's what it's here for
I shoot down a million niggas and shoot one more
And that's a million and one they couldn't hang with the appetite
'Cause they wasn't rapping right
So I had to destroy whoever was standing in my presence
For fucking up the essence
Appetite for destruction"

In these beanies and these rags living fantasies, frontin' (C'mon)
Like it's all fun and games 'til they shoot 'em up bang

Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'ma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers (C'mon)

And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, woah, yo, ho
Hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you martial
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start showing you fucking old farts

What made them real was the action in between
She dreamt that Assata was free in their old house in Queens
The fact that they always came true was the thing
Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldn't've done
Medical evidence shown she couldn't have shot the gun
It's time for her to see the sun from the other side
Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side
Time for this beautiful woman to become soft again
Time for her to breathe, and not be told how or when
She untangled the chains and escaped the pain
How she broke out of prison I could never explain
And even to this day they try to get to her
But she's free with political asylum in Cuba"

Eminem	15	3 a.m.	Relapse	2009	[Verse 2]	"Sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube, maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana then
I reach for the aloe and lanolin, bust all over the wall panellin'
Dismantlin' every candle on top of the fireplace mantel and
Grab my flannel and my bandana, then
Kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens
Causin' illusions again, brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin, razors, scissors, and pins
Jesus, when does it end? Phases that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who gave these molecules to
Me, what am I gon' do?
Hey, the prodigal son, the diabolical one
Very methodical when I slaughter them"

Pizza man don't come here no more
Too many niggas on the block, too many niggas getting shot
So the pizza man don't stop (pow, pow, pow)

JAY-Z	6	Marcy Me	4:44	2017	[Verse 1]	"Uh, back when ratchet was a ratchet and a vixen was a vixen
And Jam Master Jay was alive, I-I, I was mixin'
Cookin' coke in the kitchen
Back when Rodman was a Piston
Mike was losin' to Isiah, but he soon would get his sixth one
Gave birth to my verbal imagination
Assume a virtue if you have not
Or better yet here's a verse from Hamlet
""Lord, we know who we are
Yet we know not what we may be""
So maybe I'm the one or maybe I'm crazy
I'm from Marcy Houses, where the boys die by the thousand
Back when Pam was on Martin
Yeah, that's where it all started
When Denzel was blottin' carpet, I'll pack a nine millimeter
When Slick Rick made ""Mona Lisa""
When Lisa Bonet was Beyoncé of her day, I had divas, y'all
Think I just popped up in this bitch like a fetus? Nah
Pregnant pause, give you some second thoughts
There's room on the bandwagon, don't abort

I've been sinnin' since you been playin' with Barbie and Ken and
You can't change a player's game in the 9th inning

Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' fifty a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I'm 'sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic

Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
Her anatomy is God's temple
And it's quite simple, her castle is 'bout to be destroyed
She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
Undercovers, the dummies that look like decoys
Remember sergeant let her slide
Said if he seen what's between her thighs, he'd compromise
To no surprise
She took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome, then felt him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
'Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she toppin' off police"

My abdomen is the clip, the barrel's my dick
Uncircumcised, pull my skin back and cock me
I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggas shock me
I see niggas bleeding, running from me in fear
Stunningly, tears fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys
For years, I've been used in robberies
Giving niggas heart to follow me
Placing peoples in graves, funerals made 'cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf with a grenade
Met a wrecked-up TEC with numbers on his chest that say:
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five-and-zero
Had a serial defaced, hoping one day police would place
Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo, I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand"

M11 on your ass, bitch
Loadin' up my weapons, gettin' ready for
Another street-sweepin' neighborhood drug war
Police come around in a meat wagon
Knowin' that tonight they'll be draggin'
Off motherfuckers to a six-foot ditch
I hope your insurance paid up, bitch
'Cause tonight is the night, motherfucker
Be a good killer or a damn good ducker
'Cause if you ain't, your ass is fallin' to the paint
Bloodshed seems to make a nigga faint
Not me with a .9 in my hand
I could fall asleep lyin' next to a dead man
You gotta understand me
It's been a vet sorry motherfucker layin' out dead, see
So if you wanna come, come hard
Or you'll be another nigga in the morgue"

Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick

Why you rushin'?
You rollin' with a nigga, bitch, or what?
Walked out lookin' kinda sexy
Jumped in the vehicle, and you know what happened next, G
Took her about an hour to get hot, heh
But once I got her started it was hard to make it stop
She started makin noises, and then the heavy breathin'
I started suckin' her titties and rubbin' the pussy
Easy, he-he-he, yeah, but anyway
She was more like beggin', and pleadin' for the fuckin'
Unzipped my trousers, and then started suckin'
Had me sayin' shit, I grabbed her by the sweater
She wants to lick my booty, I guess I betta let her
Once I came I didn't want the bitch to kiss me
Thought I wanted a long one but I only wanted a quickie

Runnin' with niggas that wanna see niggas
That get it and niggas who strive

I don't trick, man I barely even feed a bitch
She say I'm stingy, I say, ""I don't need you bitch""
Go 'head leave, see if I chase you, shit!
Tell yo' mammy, I catch her in the streets I'ma get her

She just mad, cause a nigga pockets on swole
When she ask to borrow some, I say, ""Hell naw!""

I must confess that in the Chi' you're so blessed
Leaving nothing on my mind but Doggy, you and safe sex
This ain't a test, you fucking with a cold mess
Meet me in Chicago, let me hip you to this real west
It's real strong, real fat and real long
Doggies in the building, holdin' something they can feel up on
And once they get it something they can build up on
Take that skinny nigga home, work that filling till it's gone

A hole straight through your brain and leave you open (Oh, shit)

You start sweatin' and goin' through convulsions from dope shit I writ
Leavin' niggas stuck, I let stick
Trapped up in a web of a nigga that's sick

A dangerous, it's risky business fuckin' with this
Contender number one, I put you on top of the list
You're the best challenger so far, I'll give you this

Man down, now who dares to go next?
Like General Monk Monk, orders to chop necks

I cocked the baby 9, that nigga gravy mine, clanked him
What was he thinkin' on my corner when it's pay-me time?
Dug 'em, you owe me, cousin, somethin' told me ""Plug him!""
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped, son
Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came, askin' me my name, what the fuck?
I got stitched up, it went through, left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop, so how the fuck I get clapped?
Black was in the Jeep watchin', all he seen speed by was a brown Datsun
And yo, nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily

She on the sofa, holdin' a remote controller
Candles burnin' lower, favorite dish gettin' colder
She hot as solar 'cause I told her I wanna hold her
But her mission — she sittin' in one position like Yoga
A TV show is on, to top it off, she dead sober
Then I open the door up and kiss her on the shoulder
She say I'm rollin' like Mr. Lover Lover
We had a hard day, ready to parlay

Eminem	15	Love Game	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 3]	"So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record cliché
It's all my fault anyway, she's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behaviour
Back together, but forgot today was her B-day
She cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding, but just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' seventy-three, thank God there's an exit comin' up
What the mother-F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt
Hit a fuckin' tree, now here she comes at full speed
She's racin' at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch that bitch out her car through the window
She screamin', I body slam her on the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Buried the stink ho in it, then paid to have the street repaved
(The fuck?) Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, 'cause she's layin' next to me in bed—directly aimin' a gat at my head!
Woke up again and jumped up
Like, ""Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab""
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic
Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic
I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, ""Hit the road"", then after she left
I sent that bitch a text that said, ""Be careful driving
Don't read this and have an accident""
She glanced to look at it and wrecked (*Car crashes*)
Too bad, thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oréal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytellin'
While the whore was yellin', ""Rape!""
'Til her vocal cords were swellin'
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date though
Don't be late, well, the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the game of— (*Message sound*)
Wait, ""dinner at eight""? I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly 'cause of the—"

Kendrick Lamar	16	The Heart Part 5	Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers	2022	[Verse 3]	"Celebrate new life when it come back around
The purpose is in the lessons we learnin' now
Sacrifice personal gain over everything
Just to see the next generation better than ours
I wasn't perfect, the skin I was in had truly suffered
Temptation, impatience, everything that the body nurtures
I felt the good, I felt the bad, and I felt the worry
But all-in-all, my productivity had stayed urgent
Face your fears, always knew that I would make it here
Where the energy is magnified and persevered
Consciousness is synchronized and crystal-clear
Euphoria is glorified and made His
Reflectin' on my life and what I done
Paid dues, made rules, change outta love
Them same views made schools change curriculums
But didn't change me starin' down the barrel of the gun
Should I feel resentful I didn't see my full potential?
Should I feel regret about the good that I was into?
Everything is everything, this ain't coincidental
I woke up that morning with more heart to give you
As I bleed through the speakers, feel my presence
To my brother, to my kids, I'm in Heaven
To my mother, to my sis, I'm in Heaven
To my father, to my wife, I am serious, this is Heaven
To my friends, make sure you countin' them blessings
To my fans, make sure you make them investments
And to the killer that sped up my demise
I forgive you, just know your soul's in question
I seen the pain in your pupil when that trigger had squeezed
And though you did me gruesome, I was surely relieved
I completed my mission, wasn't ready to leave
But fulfilled my days, my Creator was pleased
I can't stress how I love y'all
I don't need to be in flesh just to hug y'all
The memories recollect just because y'all
Celebrate me with respect
The unity we protect is above all
And Sam, I'll be watchin' over you
Make sure my kids watch all my interviews
Make sure you live out our dreams we produced
Keep that genius in your brain on the move
And to my neighborhood, let the good prevail
Make sure them babies and the leaders outta jail
Look for salvation when troubles get real
'Cause you can't help the world until you help yourself
And I can't blame the hood the day that I was killed
Y'all had to see it, that's the only way to feel
And though my physical won't reap the benefits
The energy that carry on emits still
I want you"

I'm losin' hope, they got me stressin', can the Lord forgive me?
Got the spirit of a thug in me
Another sip of that drink, this Hennessey got me queasy
Don't wanna hurl, young nigga take it easy
Picture your dreams on a triple beam, and it seems
Don't underestimate the power of a fiend
To my homies on the block

Things I gotta do, just to prove to you

Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry

But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see

Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office and back at my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze? Ho, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-Gs
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep

And I wonder how the hell they records sell
They raps are stale and frail, and false like fairy tales
Your technique and everythin' you speak's weak
You got a little airplay because of your beats
Your fame and your name, but your lyrics are lame, black
Step to this and get ran over like a train track
Your raps are poor to wack, and you went on tour with that crap
Don't understand it, 'cause rhyme skills you lack
I got more soul than Nike Airs, givin' MC's nightmares
Rappers be frontin' hard, and rhymes — they don't write theirs

You got a bodyguard, I let my nigga tote the biscuit
Twist ya cap back, you got blood off on ya fur hat
Cap, cap, ya link snapped, you slumped off in ya Cadillac
For what though, some diamonds and a Bentley
What you dying for?
Alright hoe, I'mma bank my cheese and let my mic glow
Prioritize to live to tell these other niggas how you
Bought yo' kid some tennis shoes
Let these brothers know that your mama she got her house too
Let these niggas know that your sister wouldn't have finished

So please don't ever give me records I can't sample
So I could vacay where it ain't no channels

And I heard she drag-races, *burp* swag
Tuck in my Hanes shirt tag
You're Danica Patrick (Yeah?) word, skag
We'd be the perfect match
'Cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag
My apologies, no disrespect to technology
But what the heck's all of these buttons?
You expect me to sit here and learn that?
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda?
Be an expert at computers?
I'd rather be an Encyclopedia Britannica, hell with
PlayStation, I'm still on my first man on some Zelda
Nintendo, bitch! Run, jump, punch, stab, and I melt the
Mozzarella on my spaghetti
Put in on bread, make a sandwich with Welch's, and belch
They say this spray butter's bad for my health, but
I think this poor white trash from the trailer
Jed Clampett, Fred Sanford, and welfare
Mentality helps to keep me grounded
That's why I never take full advantage of wealth, I
Managed to dwell within these parameters
Still crammin' the shelves full of Hamburger Helper
I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt, a
Creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves, goddamn it, to hell, I
Can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I could yell, the
Other day, someone got all elaborate
And stuck a head from a fuckin' dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger King—they spit on my onion rings
I think my karma's catchin' up with me"
Eminem	15	Stronger Than I Was	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 3]	"You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide
That you caused, ‘cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde
Nah, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
‘Cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
It's like you put a knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the
Other side of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chew on a nineteen footer!
‘Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the
First time since you left
And left me with nothin' but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda had and we coulda been
But I'm breakin' out of this slump I'm in
Pullin' myself out of the dumps once again
I'm gettin' up once and for all—fuck this shit!
I'ma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fuckin' punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ
So don't lump me in with them chump-ions
I'm done bein' your punching bag
It was November 31st today
Woulda been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the 1st of May
I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call
But couldn't think of the words to say
But they came to me just now—so I put 'em in a verse to lay"
50 Cent	19	Gunz Come Out	The Massacre	2005	[Chorus]	"Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)

Persona is invulnerable, trust me son

Allow you that the chronicle has just begun"
2Pac	18	Trapped	2Pacalypse Now	1991	[Verse 1]	"You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on the streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought
Nine-millimeter kickin' thinkin' about what the streets do to me
'Cause they never taught peace in the Black community
All we know is violence, do the job in silence
Walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Too many brothers daily headed for the big pen'
Niggas comin' out worse-off than when they went in
Over the years I've done a lot of growin' up
Gettin' drunk, throwin' up, cuffed up, then I said I had enough
There must be another route, way out to money and fame
I changed my name, played a different game
Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
If one more cop harasses me, I just might go psycho
And when I get 'em, I'll hit 'em with the bum rush
Only a lunatic would like to see a skull crushed
Yo, if you're smart you'll really let me go, G
But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the Uzi"
Eminem	15	Superman	The Eminem Show	2002	[Verse 3]	"First thing you say:
""I'm not fazed, I hang around big stars all day

You're just plain old Marshall to me""
Ooh, yeah, girl, run that game
""Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
'Rot In Pieces', uh, that's great""
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans"
JAY-Z	6	Girls, Girls, Girls	The Blueprint	2001	[Outro]	"Yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya

Holla at you when I come off tour"
Rakim	10	Strong Island	The Master	1999	[Verse 3]	"Grew up in Wyndanch, formerly known as Crime-Danch
Me and my mans we travel lands to find jams
Where violence usually ends in sirens
By all means, we all fiend for finance
We make cash on the street called straight path
We take class, build with the Gods with great math
Everyday true to the street, and never fronted
Along the way, learned from the best that ever done it
Bein exposed to life's highs and lows
Got my flows ready for shows, I'm ready for the pros
I put it on a tape and then the city I tested
Then on the radio the R's requested
Now the whole world's whylin, all the girls smilin
You know, it's on, soon as they let the crowd in
The rhyme that I'm stylin, smooth as a violin
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island"
Jay-Z	12	Brooklyn’s Finest	Reasonable Doubt	1996	[Verse 3]	"Can't fade it
While y'all pump, willie, I run up and stunt silly
Scared, so you sent your little mans to come kill me
But on the con-trilli, I packs the MAC-milli
Squeezed off on him, left them paramedics breathin' soft on him
""What's ya name?"""
Scarface	11	For Real	The Untouchable	1997	[Verse 1]	"I got this coffee pot of white soap
Stuck my hanger down the center
When I entered I spent it cause it was like dope
But on the real-a he was jackin' me for scratch
'Cause out of 36 ounces this motherfucker brought me 20 back
I'm slanging 20 sacs cause I done lost 16
And these goddamn streets ain't going to bring me back
Now could it be the Southside big baller
Bolo rock slanger stones done got slaughtered-damn
I'm going up on my whole thangs
And stepped on don't go runnin my clique cause it's a cold game
And all I ever wanted was some hundred stacks
I went from slangin' O-Z's to movin' hundred sacks
Gotta make my money back
'Cause I done came too far up in these goddamn streets
To get my money snatched
I'm so for real about this motherfuckin' skrill
That any obstacle obscuring my paper is gettin' killed
For real"

I've been patiently waiting to blow
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to ""The 50 Cent Show""
This is my life, my pain, my knife, my gun
Now that I'm back, you can't sleep, I'm a nightmare, huh?
You hired cops to hold you down 'cause you fear for your life
But you done heard about them guns I done bought, right?
I ain't going nowhere, I done told you, nigga
I'm a G-Unit motherfuckin' soldier, nigga (They not gon' like you)

You don't know Elliot? Bitch, that's my jeweler
Elliantte, Fante, diamond cooler (Let's go)
I got a lot whole lot of bands in my pants, they from France
My girl from Chicago, she said she don't like rappers
I told her, ""Give me a chance""
This is a Range Rover, this not a Lamb'

I cannot count it up right with my hands
You know my gun, it came with hundred round
Yeah, and the inside, it came with a fan
Yeah (Brr), yeah (Brr)
Here I go again (Brr, hello)
If you try me, we gon' have to hit your man"
Common	22	Hungry	One Day It’ll All Make Sense	1997	[Verse]	"I walk the night in rhyming armor, bomb a nigga like a winter coat
Have him on Death Row searching for an Interscope
Yet I sparkle like Irene Cara
Symbolize dope like sirens do terror
Mary Lou just had a baby someone else decapitated
Flashbacks of past raps make me so glad I made it
Players is getting traded
I drop a gem on them who's style is jaded
My juice is grated
Shit is so banging niggas say it's gang-related
On philosopher's rink of thought, I've skated with precision
Crews is getting split like decisions
Com'a let it ride and collision
Vision like Coleco or Intelli', I battle stars in stellar
Regions, my thought scheme was my like my offspring
Now it's teething
My reason to rhyme applies to season and time
Seizing the mind, body and regions divine
In mom's cookouts, I'm leaving the swine
Verbal vegetarian, squash beef with Ice Cube
Came in this rap life nude
Now I'm fully clothed with flows
You tricks can't hide behind expensive cars and clothes
Old niggas I expose like Luke does hoes in videos
With classic material, imperial and rugged like
Got mag, but my slugs a mic
You fake like a smile, like a hug, I'm tight
Skip ladies, this is rip-a-motherfucker night
Auricle air-outs, niggas don't even run for cover right
Downtown, interracial lovers hold hands
I breathe heavy like an old man with a cold can of Old Style
Hold a Stone Isle profile
Mix between Malcolm X and Sef when I go wild
Hold mics like a second nut until the second coming
Humming coming towards you with power like forwards do
Hip-hop, you my bitch and like a Ford, I'm exploring you
Some wack niggas be cool, with them, I stay cordial
Flow at room temperature, cats is presumed miniature
Like golf, soft like Tiger Woods
At real nigga angles, I've stood with ways that's geometric
Don't need to rob banks with dyke broads to set it
I levitate to the occasion, lounge like a lyricist
Rhyme-wise, you a rest haven
You sat by the door spooked like I was Wes Craven
You need to do more deleting and less saving
A praise in hell, raising heaven as the bill on my pager leavens
What you should have known from day one you will on day seven"
Big Boi	26	Ova da Wudz	ATLiens	1996	[Verse 1]	"Undercover, over the hills and through the woods I go
Like green lights, a Southern nigga that's comin' for your throat
But not no guillotine see, we be them Southern playas
Remember the football socks, aerobic Reeboks and Decaturs, now
You up to par and ready for your lesson
I got an ounce of dank and a couple of drinks so let's crank up a session
Like Tri-Cities High School, was pulling 'em in a broke down Rabbit
I spit a couple of words and laying 'em down was just a habit
Just like Smokey, choking off da pee-wee that we rolled up
Talking about the clique will get you nathaniel but swolled up
Hootie Hoo slapped you boys across the cheek with Isotoners
And went to tell yo momma and yo pop that you was a goner
Tell 'em Big Boi did it; I swear that nigga be rhyming
Every lyric that he spit be turning charcoals into Diamonds and Pearls
Girl, when you giving up them drawers, 'cause
I got a couple of niggas down the hall
That want to hit it too, I'm not the type to be acting selfish
Set it out and let it out and I'll be right back just like Elvis
'Cause the postman rings twice... (Yeah)
Hey Mr. Postman... (It's like that)
Yeah"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Poe Mans Dreams (His Vice)	Section.80	2011	[Verse 1]	"I used to want to see the penitentiary way after elementary
Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalized
My intuition had said I was suited for family ties
My mama is stressin', my daddy tired
I need me a weapon, these niggas ride
Every minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me
How I'm gon' listen when I don't even hear God?
Heaven or hell, base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty, you worried 'bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that kill with you'll squeal with you
I deal with you like my son, stare at the sun
And you'll be looking in my eyes, homie
Stand for something or fall for anything
And you working with two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway, this for my niggas
Uncles, twenty-three hours, sendin' me pictures
I want you to know that I'm so determined to blow
That you hear the music I wrote, hope it get you off death row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A Metro PC phone, then you went back in
So when I touch the pen, the pen is in my view
I'ma get it right, just so you"
Nas	9	Watch Dem Niggas	It Was Written	1996	[Verse 1]	"They never realized how real Nas is, so decisive
It's just the likeness of Israelites mist that made me write this
A slight twist of lime rhyme, be chasing down your prime-time
Food for thought, or rather mind wine
The Don Juan features the freak shit
My thesis on how we creep quick
Fucking your wife, that ain't no secret
It's mandatory — see, that pussy, they hand it to me
I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story
There ain't no drama that my niggas never handled for me
My gator brand is Mauri, walking through rough land before me
Where the snakes put a smile on they face
Hoping and praying I'm stuck
Scoping, they lay in the cut, weighing my luck
Player haters play this in cell blocks and rocked stages
Winking at some female cops with cocked gauges
Really, it's papers I'm addicted to
Wasn't for rap, then I'd be sticking you
The MAC inside the Triple Goose
Face down on the floor's the routine
Don't want hear nobody blow steam
Just C.R.E.A.M. or it's a smoke screen
Imagine that, that's why I hardly kick the bragging raps
I zone, to each his own in this ghetto inhabitant"
Big Boi	26	Hootie Hoo	Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik	1994	[Verse 3]	"Well, you know we getting blizzard
'Cause we got that chicken gizzard
In the dungeon and scope
But some of you niggas can't cope with it
So, Opie, hip-hop, to the front, to the back, it don't stop
From the streets of ATL to the slums of College Park
So God Almighty know, it's Outkast for the '94 era
You heard the player's call, we takin' it to another level
So 'lujah, Halle, let me get a swallow of that Martell
And you may go to Hell"
Travis Scott	33	TOPIA TWINS	UTOPIA	2023	[Verse 4]	"It's not electric, this shit gassed up, can you catch it? (Skrrt, skrrt)
The Virgil jetski one of one-fifty, check the leverage
Got two twins, they top tier, that's my favorite fetish
Deep in her throat 'til she tear, I'm her favorite beverage (Straight up)
Ran out of time, made ten APs, man, I can't retire
Been on the road collectin' rubber bands to match attire (Yeah)
I got the vision, ain't no dippin' in that ayahuasca
This shit get thicker than a bitch with stripes, LSU Tigers
Ayy, twin, call up twin, tell her I'm in town now
London bitch, she wanna link, she dropped the pin to pound town
Ass thick, when she walk, it got its own surround sound
And she tryna ride me like a wave, I'ma drown, drown
She say she like the way the soul chop, it make her bounce, bounce
She from the west, but when she with me, she from down south
Flew into town, not to hotel, but to the town house
I send the drop, they hit the drop, we brought the drops out"
Kanye West	5	Facts (Charlie Heat Version)	The Life of Pablo	2016	[Verse 1]	"Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, I feel so accomplished

If Nike ain't have Drizzy, man, they would have nothin', woo!
If Nike ain't have Don C, man, they would have nothin', ooh!
But I'm all for the family, tell 'em, ""Get your money""
Yeezy, Yeezy, Yeezy, they line up for days
Nike out here bad, they can't give shit away
I stuck to my roots, I'm like Jimmy Fallon
I ain't dropped the album but the shoes went platinum (Woo!)
Every time I talk, they say I'm too aggressive
I was out here spazzin', now y'all get the message?!
On the field, I'm over-reckless, on my Odell Beckham
2020, I'ma run the whole election, yah!
I've been trending years, y'all a couple days
Yeezy in the house and we just got appraised
Nike, Nike treat employees just like slaves
Gave LeBron a billi' not to run away (You!)
Ten-thousand dollar fur for Nori, I just copped it (You!)
Your baby daddy won't even take your daughter shoppin' (You!)
I done wore designers I won't wear again
Make 'em niggas famous, they get arrogant"

The Game	13	Like Father Like Son 2	The Documentary 2.5	2015	[Verse 2]	"Ten years later, I love you too sons
I do life in the box if they ever fuck with my two sons
You're my lil' man, I remember the first day you came out
Your lil' face, your big nose, your lil' feet, your lil' hands
You turned one, come in the room wobbly, lil' stance
And every time I walked in the house he used to do this lil' dance
On the cover of the album with them Chucks on
You cried for 6 hours, your mama in here going nuts on me
She said you had enough, I said we having fun
All babies cry when they're one, my career had just begun
And so did being a daddy
Car seat in my Escalade, you want me in the Caddy
Playing Like Father, Like Son, looking in the back seat
He don't look nothing like his mama if you ask me
On the first album Busta Rhymes did the hook
Now he can do it for himself, watch him and his uncle cook

Prodigy	8	Can’t Fuck Wit	Murda Muzik	1999	[Verse 3]	"Soldier boys stay on ya toes, be on ya P's and Q's
Keep ya eyes bright comin out ya buildin, duke
You might bump into a bullet or stumble on ya death
Niggas slumber, I put 'em in a deep coma
I keep guns cuz it's like that, you figure it out
I got an arson for niggas tryin to figure me out
You ain't a killa, you just talk more, runnin ya mouth
The type of nigga, we'll stomp out and bloody down
Look, we a Mobb for real, don't let the LP's twist it
Cut me a cheque cuz I don't talk business
Drop anthems worth millions and spend millions
Take trips with my niggas to the Keys on the weekends
Serious jewels, pissy off the fruits
Dunn, we move like the marines, move when we come through
Seduce bitches dizzy, half they friends and they moms wanna hit me
Y'all know my stiggity"

It's on so you can swerve when it's heard in clubs
Thought patterns displayed on Persian rugs
Equations are drawn up in paisley form
Mic it stay warm, my flow is Evian
Deep as a Nautilus, you stay dipped in Ra style
From the shores of Long Island to Panama Canal
Intellect pitches new trends like a clothes designer
I'm in effect, quicker than medicines in China
Split the mic open fill it with somethin potent to go in
And take a toke then, mental planes start floatin
Hot science is smokin altitudes cause chokin
Product is hypnotic you're soakin and still smokin
Showin better scenes than grams of amphetamines
Plans to scheme, means I'll forever fiend
Long as the mic is loud and the volume is pumpin
I'mma move crowds to 2000"

Showed some effort, made fat records, but still saw no green
Know what I mean? They tried to stifle us
Nigga you could not believe how really ill and trife it was
Fed up so we headed on a serious mission
Wishing that we could better our position
Two businessmen, Guru and Preme, we enterprized
Too strong to be stepped on, creatively wise
The dedicated ministers of underground sound
When we're doing our thing, you know we don't fuck around
No matter how bizarre and different you think you are
Your team wouldn't dream of competing with Gang Starr
Premier in the rear with the beats and cuts
And Guru with the mic ready to tear shit up
Take us out the game nigga? How you figure?
The name is well kept, and the rep just gets bigger"

That make it rain, all my niggas throw a stack money
Stack it to the ceilin' then call it Shaq money
That walk in the club, straight to the back money
Flavor of Love, Deelishis sittin' on my lap money
That rap money, niggas get clapped money
Air Force One's don't bend when I trap money
Ooooh, I'm Rich like Porter
Havin' Alpo nightmares whippin' that water
Like McDonald's, I was flippin' them orders

Usually I'm dolo, and I got a crazy team
Call 'Kiss to ride on you, watch for the laser beam
Shit, it's that O.G. flavor
Remind you of a corner bodega and that Olde E behavior
On play, but I ain't trying to scuffle with chumps
My long joints got the culture power plus the double pump
Troublesome to anyone who stands in the way
I'll stand and I'll spray, fuck if your man's in the way
Your girl want me ‘cause I do it better than you
The whole world wants me, nigga, I'm a legend to you
Like LL, Rakim, Ice-T and them niggas
Like Cube, Snoop and Dre, I'ma be seeing them figures
It don't matter, you don't have to be liking me, man
Keep playing, you'll be laying there, right where you stand"

2Pac	18	If My Homie Calls	2Pacalypse Now	1991	[Verse 2]	"It's a shame, you chose the dope game
Now you slang 'caine on the streets with no name
It was plain that your aim was more 'caine
You got fame, now you reign with no shame
I chose rap tracks to make stacks
In fact, I travel the map with raps that spray cats
But now I don't wanna down my homie
No matter how low you go, you're not lonely
And I hear that you made a few enemies
But when you need a friend, you can depend on me
Call if you need my assistance, there'll be no resistance
I'll be there in an instant
Who am I to judge another brother, only on his cover?
I'd be no different than the others
H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E
I'm down to the E-N-D
'Cause it's a fall in no time at all
I'm down for y'all, when my homies call
Word, if my homies call"
Eminem	15	Cleanin’ Out My Closet	The Eminem Show	2002	[Verse 2]	"I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
'Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show"

He dealt with measurements his language, was mathematics
His theoretical wisdom of the numerical system
The complete number nine which means born or existed
He gave birth to all planets, inorganic, and organic
So you wouldn't take it for granted
They rotated they own distance around the sun
And fully submit to the existance of one
And each one was promised everlasting perfection
If each one keeps spinnin in the same direction
To the East, and each speak the motion of peace
And harmony, and each show devotion to teach
The universe is to come, the whole world must go according
Know your galaxies and mirages stars start fallin
So stay in your orbit maintain safe and sound
Like the planets each cipher remains perfectly round"

In the hood, summertime is the killing season
It's hot out this bitch, that's a good enough reason (Woo)
I've seen gangstas get religious when they start bleeding
Saying ""Lord, Jesus help me"" 'cause they ass leaking
When that window roll down and that AK come out
You can squeeze your little handgun 'til you run out
And you can run for your backup
But them machine gun shells gon' tear your back up
God's on your side? Shit, I'm aight with that
'Cause we gon' reload them clips and come right back
It's a fact, homie, you go against me, you're fucked
I get the drop, if you can duck, you're luckier than Lady Luck
Look, nigga, don't think you safe 'cause you moved out the hood
'Cause your mama still around, dawg, and that ain't good
If you was smart, you'd be shook of me
'Cause I'll get tired of looking for you, spray your mama crib and let your ass look for me"

Ooh, I don't want more than that; girl, I respect the cat
I promise, just a touch
Let me put the head in

You gotta learn how to shake the snakes, nigga
'Cause the police love to break a nigga
Send 'em upstate 'cause they straight-up hate the niggas
So what I do is get a crew of zoo niggas
Straight fools into rules and do niggas
And one-time had enough of me
I'm still raw so the law can't fuck with me
They wanna send me to the pen', punk, picture that
I stay strapped, motherfuckers better get your gat
It ain't easy bein' me, I can't take it
Life as a celebrity ain't everything they make it
And ever since the movies these hoes try to do me
If they can't screw me, they find a way to sue me
Now can you picture me coolin' at a night club?
Nothin' but love, but motherfuckers wanna mean mug
Since I wear a lot of gold, they plot
Don't know what I got and get shot with the hot ones
And, aw yeah, I wanna feel guilty
But you punk motherfuckers tried to milk me
You'll get smacked behind the ear with my phone or my pager
It's beepin' while I cut you with my razor

'Til the day that I drop, you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck"

Walk in the strip club, make it rain for three hours

Perc'd out, took chances in my hood like Nevada

Hundred thousands, I just cashed out on designer
Gotta devour, nigga, I learned that in the jungle
Once I sell this load, that's a million in a week"

So don't be upset if I toss your girl
I got cheddar to blow, pockets never get low
Bitches sweat me wherever I go
I cruise in a GS Lex', Cartier specs
Nautica sweats with the fresh Gortex
Jewels with baguettes, swingin like the Mets
Throwin the dice and takin all side bets
Never bummy; sip rummy, get money
When I hit honies she felt the dick in her tummy
On the le-low I see dough from here to Rio
Flamboyant Records, C to the E-O - what?"
Big L	25	Size ’Em Up	The Big Picture	2000	[Chorus]	"All my wolves in the house, are you live or what?

Look at my chest, now you seen Vegas
Treat my money like the Cristal that we wastin'
Cause I'm a money machine, I could re-make it
You a fool thinkin' that Freddy could see Jason
I've been iced out, like who the fuck need Jacob
The doc told me to be patient, but I want
Money like Dwight Howard, next time he a free agent
I'm tryin' to make enough money so I could feed Asia
Have Asians in the kitchen cookin' in Louis V. aprons
Word to Martha Stewart, if I could park a Buick
Then I could flip a Brink's truck, I got the heart to do it
Ball like the nigga Tony Parker do it
Speak no Ingles but dinero I talk it fluent"

When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock

Put you punks on blast for not knowing the law
Don't deny yourself, learn to apply yourself
Or end up by yourself, I multiply the wealth
I got the titles, deeds, licenses and policies
Complete ownership, Don Gurizzu they call me
Primo said that we should just, lock it all down
See the bigger picture, so we can profit all around
Now everybody's riding the dick, once I spit again

Equipped with night vision, shell catchers and inf-beams, huh?"

Wannabe thug get smacked for back talkin'

No conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs once I'm on that pedestal
Frightenin', so fuckin' frightenin'
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don't sing, or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang
The drama it bring is crazy, product of the late '80s
Tryna stay above water, that's why we shun the Navy

You not the first person
The first person from your first curse until your first cursive
And your curse words is in the curve version
It occurs virgin is the word version
That refers perfect to the first person
In the third verse, who's really me
In the third person but prefers the first one
That's me, again
Master cleanse in a syringe
From a gerber until your first burger
Pamper to her depends
Everything between is just drawers
Even in between is no loss
Even where the king is no boss
Meet it with a swing it's so south, yeah
Unless you Bamm Bamm
Knocking them pitches into the grand stands
In the club, watching the women just do them handstands
Like you a man's man
That's washing down a ham with the Zam Zam
Who got a baby in here with these strippers?
She's two weeks pregnant
Didn't even know, he's dancing with her, damn..."
Dr. Dre	1	Lil’ Ghetto Boy	The Chronic	1992	[Verse 2]	"Now I'm holdin' a dub, sittin' on swoll
Twenty-seven years old, up for parole, stroll
I'm back up on my feet with my mind on the money
That I'll be makin' soon as I touch the streets
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right
But it ain't no thang to me
'Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed OG
The lil' homies from the hood with grip
Are the ones I get with 'cause I'm down to set trip
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so what you wanna do?
Didn't know he had a twenty-two
Straight sittin' behind his back
I grabbed his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground with blood on my hands
I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I used to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get (For what?)
For tryin' to jack the lil' homies for they grip"

He's more confident to live his plan now (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)
But the family in disbelief this time (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)
Convincing themselves, ""He ain't living discreet, he's fine"" (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)
They said they never seen it in him, but I seen it (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
The Barbie dolls played off reflection of Venus (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
He built a wall so tall you couldn't climb over
He didn't laugh as hard when the kids start joking (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
""Faggot, faggot, faggot,"" we ain't know no better
Middle school kids with no filter, however
I had to be very mindful of my good cousin
I knew exactly who he was, but I still loved him
Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
I mean he's really Mary-Ann, even took things further
Changed his gender before Bruce Jenner was certain
Living his truth even if it meant see a surgeon
We didn't talk for a while, he seemed more distant
Wasn't comfortable around me, everything was offensive
But I recall we both had a sick sense of humor
Made raw, but time changes all"

We Mobb Deep anytime we stomp niggas out
Or I might catch you all on myself and spaz out
How ever it plays out, niggas is assed out
Take yourself to the first safe house and lock it down
So we wildin, for two thousand and two poundin
Any nigga out runnin with they mouth bound em
Guns clap security be callin for back up
Mildew bullets drop niggas leavin em bagged up
While we mash in a jag truck, with the 22's
They spin like how the 44 spun on you (uh-huh uh-huh)
And clap you niggas in the first degree (uh-huh uh-huh)"
André 3000	27	Call of Da Wild	Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik	1994	[Verse 1]	"I'll be comin' around the ghetto when I come kickin' one for the treble

I ain't braggin', folks draggin' me up and down the road (Yeah)
They'll be fucked up when I gets into my clownin' mode
Then cut the clown up on they ass like Bozo
Oh, no, then dance on top of they asses like Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggas with machine guns, I think that is the answer
But the question, ""Should we take that bullshit from them people?""
I'm makin' 300 on my SAT, yet I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to forehead of suckers tryna serve us
To graduate is really becomin' a very stressful journey
I feel like a steerin' wheel, for them is tryin' to turn me
Into a hatemonger, and I'm wishin' and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer?
I think not, Officer Friendly tryna dig up in me
He said I'm half-assed and got no future and so he sent me
Up the creek and shit, strokin' like hell without no paddle
But niggas is gettin' smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years
It's the call of the wild, nigga, uh, there it is"
Kurupt	4	One By One	Dogg Food	1995	[Verse 2]	"Connectin' lyrics like dot-to-dot, connectin' blocks

Murderin' MC's for no fuckin' apparent reason (Muthafucka!)
This lyricist kicks lyrics
So intent to disable to kill your whole vocal existence
Again, for instance, the murderous methods of my ridin'
To Thunderdome, nigga's head I'm squabbin'
Shit! All I know is you could talk that talk (It'z Dogg Pound!)
And you best to be able to walk that walk
Because we ride right, daylight or after midnight

....Now, gettin' back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back - New jacks are made hollow
Expressin' ain't their subject because they like to follow the words
The style, the trend, the records I spin
Again and again and again
Yo ya on the other end
Watch a brother playin' dope rhymes, with no help
There's no fessin' and guessin' while I'm expressin myself
It's crazy to see people be what society wants 'em to be
But not me
Ruthless, is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto, and rap for the pop charts
And those musicians, curse at home
But scared to use profanity, when up on the microphone
Yeah they want reality, but you won't hear none
They rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs, and take a stand
But after the show they go lookin for the dope man
Oh they ban my group from the radio
Hear N.W.A. and say ''Hell no!''
But you know it ain't all about wealth
As long as you make a note to
(express yourself)"

I'm a hammerhead with a hammer the size of a tank
Ever heard of a gangsta? Well, you must have heard of us

Everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
Of the room, just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens a door
For conversation like I want that
I'm not lookin' for extra attention
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant
Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha!
Marshall, you're so funny, man
You should be a comedian, goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell

You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon
Heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga"

If you a pimp, why ya hoes stay outta pocket?

Nervous, burnin' down the churches
They're scared of us, rather beware than dare to trust
Throw us in jail, million dollar bail, left there to rust
Let's call in order, give ourselves a chance to enhance broader
Advance to where minorities are the majority voter
Holdin' my own, I'm livin' alone in this cold world
My sister just bought a home without a loan, you go girl
She's an exception, some people can leap to the impression
See, me myself, I start flippin' and fall victim to deep depression
I'm stressin' the issue here, so we can gross the fiscal year
Tired of gettin' fired and hired as a pistol-eer
There's no longevity livin' off negativity
Fuck it, I'd rather sell reefer than do pizza delivery
That's how the city be, everybody gettin' they hustle on
Judge singin' death penalty like it's his favorite fuckin' song
Word is bond, takin' my life you know they lovin' it

And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Mama a Benz and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now I'm rolling in a nine-trizzay El Do-Rad

I can't hold it back, I'm looking for the line
Taking off my coat, clearing my throat
The rhyme will be kicking until I hit my last note
My mind remains refined, all kind of ideas

Told the dawgs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith

Big Boi	26	Knowing	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse 2]	"Even though things started falling apart
Wanda went and bought a Honda, now she's out of a job
She would slob on a knob for a little less than a yard
A massage, you could drill her like a sarge'
She would charge and rob, pick through your pockets
She got the trick's watch and the silver locket
That he bought for his wife but Wanda left her license
On the nightstand fuckin' with this white man
She met in a little red Corvette, paid for sex
Made a deal that she would never forget, you can bet
Every action has a positive and equal reaction
Therefore everything that goes around comes around in that fashion
Fast and furiously
There was a knock on the sliding glass door, ""Bitch, it's me
You thought you was slick the way you hit me for that lick
But you slipped, now I'm gettin' in your shit"""

And take a ticket to play with it like a Slinky
So put your lips on my big chocolate twinkie
And you swallow all the nut if you bitches are smart
To make my dick pop up like a Pop-Tart
But after I nut I'mma leave ya
But first I must deceive ya, because bitch I don't need ya
And don't say that you love me too
Cause if I turn my back you would fuck the whole crew
You're nothin' but a stank ho' tryin' to take my bank ho'
So I have to let you know  at a hotel
And a motel and a holiday inn (say what?)
Because if that bitch starts fuckin' up yo
I'll just fuck her friend"

Bitches, money and guns, aimin' and you fire
Everyday is grief, if it ain't beef, it's feedin' your seed
Tryna eat? You form material needs
The weed make your brain sizzle, a pistol make it cool off
By stickin' up niggas, make them take they jewels off
His reputation is bigger than his whole life span
He never planned to fail, he just failed to plan
What does it take to realize, Satan's alive, he whispers
And any chance he get, he can take niggas
He comes in all shapes and sizes, his best disguise is
When he stand beside us, but God is inside us, within me
You are your worst enemy - my mom's words echo in my head
And if I let go I'm dead
He stepped at my door, the takes motivate my spirit
An out of body experience, so now I feel it
Lookin' at my blessings, the bullets - that missed me coulda hit me
Them court cases coulda put me in the penitentiary
I never hate, that's just wasted energy
The past is gone, the present's a gift, so what's the mystery?
The future - and time only reveals, what fear is
False expectations, appearin' real
We only human, love thy neighbor, so I was told
And I will 'til permanently, my eyes are closed"

Fake-ass facade that they couldn't keep up

Calm down, listen to a brother who knows
Cause the rappers out here come up with mad different types of flows
Switch-up, change-up, yo pull the range up
So we can build on this shit, for real that's how we came up
Used to ride the subway trains back and forth
Now I push an E-Class, four-two-zero of course
Still material gains, make one more aware
Of all the madness and the civil unrest that's out here
I doubt there, is anyplace more complex
You can get lost in the sauce, New York'll have you vexed
Who's next to get served, herbs'll get knocked off
Burning flammable rappers, is how I get my rocks off
I pop your top off as if you were the bottle
Then I'll drain all your fluid, you're better off playing lotto
Bright lights, big city and the dark alleyways
New York we get the money all day everyday"

I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi'
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said, ""Mommy, I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford""
See, you're unbreakable, unmistakable

A livin' legend too, just look at what Heaven do
Sent us an angel, and I thank you, Mama"

He never learned, so in turn I'm kidnappin' his baby's mother
My hand around her collar, feedin' her cheese
She said the taste of dollars was shitty, so I fed her fifties
About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced
I kept feedin' her money 'til her shit started to make sense
Who could ever foresee?
We used to stay up all night at slumber parties
Now I'm tryna rock his bitch to sleep
All the years we were real close
Now I see his fears through her tears
Know she's wishin' we were still close
Don't cry, it is to be
In time I'll take away your miseries and make it mine

She wanted me badly so I put it inside
She got the (front, back, and side to side)
Back and forth with the gangster glide
Started off at 6 and didn't finish till 9
Hit the showers like I been out playing ball for the Knicks
Now she's asleep, cause she just had her drawers full of dick
(now that's sick) and plus she got you staying at home
With the kids all alone while she's gettin' her fuck on
So believe me when you downin' the Brad

You were the illest man alive now I'm reading your eulogy
Eyes so serious, you told me hold my head
Pursue this rap shit and go forward never backwards
While you gripped TECs tight, and ran niggas out of town
I ripped up mics, showin wack niggas how to sound
Still your essence, was callin
By two gunshots, at close range, your frame had fallen
Now like a angel you've risen
And you will stay in my heart, and yo I wish you were still livin

I wasn't starstruck, I was just glad to be signed
And even though sometimes I run loose
You still my homeboy, Doc, I'd take a bullet for you
I'm not askin' you to take my side in the beef
But you told me it was okay to say ""Fuck The Police"",
Now it's my turn to carry the torch
And I still got the chain that you wore on the cover of The Source,
Remember when we got drunk, to do Start From Scratch?
I told you, ""You was like a father to me"", I meant that
Sittin' here lookin' at my platinum plaques
Thinkin' what the fuck am I without a Dr. Dre track,
When Doc say, ""It's a wrap"", it's a wrap
It's still Aftermath, and ain't nothin' after that"

To the set of prenuptial, got paid and too comfortable
It's all good, read 'em on the humble
And while you shinin' in the spotlight
I got this dot right to aim right and stop life
The trife life, ain't no part twos (Hell no)
When it's over, it's over, you hit
Now send your soldierlys through
Yo, chewin' chihuahua-ass niggas, pull 'em by the collar
And let the lights dim it
And you'll be swimmin' in a puddle of reality juice
Fatality too, this rap shit is the bitch you shouldn't married into
To the set of prenuptial, got paid and too comfortable
It's all good, read 'em on the humble
And while you shinin' in the spotlight
I got this dot right to aim right and stop life
The trife life, ain't no part twos (Hell no)
When it's over, it's over, you hit
Now send your soldierlys through (Nigga, bloodsport)"
Eminem	15	The Monster	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 1]	"I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Woo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—"
Rakim	10	When I B on tha Mic	The Master	1999	[Verse 3]	"To my elite peeps with the murderous mystiques
I hit the street with beats and they critique for weeks
They be like: ""How that kid Ra reach the peak?""
Pull out the heat and use my technique to speak
It's dangerous, sit calm and explain to kids
What part of the game this is in foreign languages
They hold Ra's events in different continents
Put my lyrical contents in monuments
In ghetto garments, I rock a towel like a pharaoh
Mind travel, design style like apparel
My fashions last long as a lifetime
‘Cause I can see the future when the god write rhyme
They're mad ‘cause I managed to reign so long
Like their chance to get money done came and gone
This is strictly for my listeners on the corners at night
And the sisters that be keepin' us right, when I be on the mic"
OutKast	28	Love In War	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse]	"Tonight we'll make the prettiest song
That no one will ever hear
No one will ever hear
No one will ever
These ain't the times to be alone
Cliché, the end is near
Cliché, the end is near
Cliché, the end is
Quickly approaching while we carry on
No one is promised another day
Why can't the story end like fairytales often do?
Before I let you leave, I've got to say"

Guru	20	ALONGWAYTOGO	Hard to Earn	1994	[Verse 2]	"Now in '93, realistically you should be
Well aware of all the evils out there
It's like a jungle sometimes, you get the message?
You got to rumble sometimes, it's gettin' hectic
Emotions run deep as times run out
Solutions, it's time to find some out
So according to me, suckers are barred
From obstructing my discussion 'cause I rhyme too hard
You take a whiff like a spliff here like some fresh air
I came to claim shit this year
Take a stroll down the walkway or hallway or runway
Fuck with us, kid, you'll pay
I slay and, yo, I'm still on the expressway
I kick my essay, then you know we don't play
So pray down on your knees, G
'Cause it's the best way, yes, the best way"

We got the same fuckin' moves"

Prodigy	8	Extortion	Hell On Earth	1996	[Verse 2]	"I hold a nine Ruger, with an infa-spot disc
Red dot right at your face, so set sail or rock it
And kept drivin', pull off like the Indy 5G
In a four-time Ford truck with speed
Like the motion picture, this nigga gone with the wind
My crime work, ninja style shit was did
And got away with, escaped it, the jakes from tracin' (What?)
Anythin' that lead to the source, you know the boss
Of the Mobb killin', is like an unsolved mystery
Puzzlin', nobody knows, it's all history
Madness amongst me, I frequently have to get doubly
Never fails, it's always somethin'
No rest, daily, gotta rock my vest
I shoot at your best man, yeah, your MVP
He played the front line, got struck down immediately
I wave a Mobb Deep flag, you hear the sound as it slaps wind
Heavy load, my military hold ammunition
Far from animation, it's real live, you think not?
My crew, kings of New York who takin' your spot
I put the green light on your whole clique, Island shit
Runnin' through the whole house wildin', extortin' it"
Kanye West	5	Bittersweet Poetry	Graduation	2007	[Verse 1]	"And she claims she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep, bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurting me
I'd never do that to you, at least purposely
We breaking up again, we making up again
But we don't love no more, I guess we fucking then
Have you ever felt you ever want to kill her?
And you mix them emotions with tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights, y'all have a bad fight
And you talk about her family, her aunts and shit
And she say, ""Motherfucker, your momma's a bitch""
You know, domestic drama and shit, all the attitude
I'd never hit a girl, but I'll shake the shit out of you
But I'ma be the bigger man, big pimpin' like Jigga man
Oh, I guess I figure it's"
Nas	9	We Will Survive	I Am...	1999	[Verse 3]	"I wonder what the Commodores went through on tour?
Did Smokey Robinson, have to shoot his way out a war?
What has Al Green seen, that made him religious?
Was it the drugs, put an end to the music business?
If so, should I put out the indo right now and write down
A plan and pursue my dream, turn my life around
'Cause I'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream
I'll need a extra Uzi ridin' through my own hood in Queens
It be the ones you always knew, that want it on
Tellin' everybody it was him, that you fronted on
Thought we walked a million miles it was just twenty
Not used to walkin' in the path of legit money
I thought I made it but we only took baby steps
Up the success ladder, where they pay me checks
To my clicks when I got it I said ""Baby bless""
That was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess
We in the 90's and finally it's lookin' good
Hip-Hop took it to billions, I knew we would
A lot of ups and downs in the game
Could lose or gain a couple pounds tryin' to maintain
One day you here, the next you not; when you around niggas, check 'em out
Some is 'bout it, most individuals plots
And run the spots, some choose to stay to they selves
While others have no cares and stay in jail
More than 50% of us endin' up with holes through the chest
Through the head, through the gut it shows
The future for us young shooters and old killers
Who become rich as dope dealers?
Nothin' left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments
Thug coaches with subs sittin' on the bench; either that or rap
We want the fast way out of this trap
Whether it be 9 to 5 or slangin' crack
To my deceased Gods wishin' I could bring you back
But life is a dream and y'all taught me that"
50 Cent	19	So Amazing	The Massacre	2005	[Verse 2]	"I call just to say ""Hope you're having a nice day""
You're special, I'd get into you, oops, I mean I'm into you
Every chance I get, I find time to spend with you
Jet could bring you to me, just to watch a movie
Better yet, to watch you climb in the Jacuzzi
Yeah, bubbles in a, bath, Dom in a, glass
Funny how time flies when you full of laughs
It's fun but before long, a nigga gotta dash
For the lifestyle I live, a nigga need cash to come quick
So I don't fuck with the stash
I know you like pumps and boots, I like Jeeps and Coupes
So I grind all the time, to stay with some loot
I put a spell on ya, I like to call it a spell
In the bedroom working it well
I don't kiss and tell but I don't care if you kiss and tell
You can tell your girlfriend the details"

Low pro, so low look like I'm ridin' on blades
In one year mayne, a nigga so paid
I have a straight bitch in the telly goin' both ways (Ahh)
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to you just how you like it, girl
You're now rockin' with the best
Tre pound on my hip, Teflon on my chest
They say, I'm no good, 'cause I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
'cause shit might pop off, and if shit pop off
Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Bougie-ass bitches, you can kiss my ass"
Rakim	10	It’s a Must	The Master	1999	[Verse 2]	"They said I was ahead of my time or either here before
To see the idea clear, it takes a year or more
Now times that by the years, I reign straight-seven
No hear for four years still multiplied by eleven
The silence's a set backs, make 'em regret that
One way to get back is violence and wet cats
But hold your head, black, or I'll never rap again
Just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in
Now that was two years ago and if cats start interferin'
Then I'mma go back to the gat and racketeerin'
My sabotage is camouflage and espionage
You ain't havin' Ra, so don't test the God
I'm takin' all orders, I can't afford extorters
I hit 'em in the head with a hundred dollars in quarters
So warn a friend, tell 'em it's on again
If it's a freestyle bust in a park, I want in"

Nas	9	The N... (Don’t Hate Me Now)	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Verse 2]	"The style is taboo, the chain's offensive
Brain on airplanes, Gucci frames are vintage
The two Tec Don in Yukon's and Benzes
Chicks who suck other chicks tits like infants (wow)
The Apprentice but not Trump, I'm the nigga with Glocks and pumps
That you don't see much, sucker free from chumps
Homes with cobblestones in front of 'em
He's got guns in cummerbunds, so understand you under son
Don't make me have you running from a hundred guns
Don't make me grab your only son, I'm coming from
A place Tanqueray and weed's the only escape
From phonies who hate, when you rolling with papes
That's why the god party with juicy models
They mob me, Denali, Charlie Luciano
Hardly have to tell y'all, I kill y'all for spitting songs that involve me nigga
Original verbal assassin, have to carve me a nigga"
Travis Scott	33	CIRCUS MAXIMUS	UTOPIA	2023	[Verse 1]	"A walk-in attraction

Welcome to my world where it's packed in
At the top of the tavern
How I see when this happenin'
All the real have been dabbed in
All the, all the bumps and the grabbin'
Ain't no cops here harassin'
All the looks and the laughin'
And outside, it got traffic
'Cause inside, we wreak havoc
Yеah, I know when this
Yeah, I know when this drastic, whеre it's goin'
When I back up emotions
All this here, I'm controllin'

When I'm back in the streets, on my side, I'm patrollin'
When I'm back in the, when I'm back in the (Ah)"

In the middle of the drought, I flipped pies, my niggas
I did joints with Mary J. Blige, my niggas
I've eluded the coppers, got booted with Big Poppa
Skated through with the Caesar picadas
At high school got head by the lockers
Gassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers
Rocked jewels, dropped school, still didn't fail
Rhymes still written well, hold court in the street
Never sit in the cell for a second then I'm gettin' my bail
Shoot it out with the bounty hunters
Fuck sittin' in the county for summers if they should down me
Everybody around us become one for that day
To live life get your shit right and play
Don't get it twisted like braids, if I'm missed it's okay
But life's short, don't miss a day, uhh"

It’s the secret, I want the world to know that you’re mine
But on some real shit, communications could be better
So I’m writing this song instead of a love letter
They gon’ play it on the radio a hundred times a day
I figure when you hear it you gon’ stop and think of me
I wanna get to know you and be the reason you smile
Girl you know where I’m from, you know how I get down
When times get tough, tell me that I’m special
Not rap, I mean me, that I’m special
You know they say diamonds are a girl’s best friend
Precious stones, could you put me before them?
If so, I’ll see to it they always around
Nothing but the best, now how does that sound?
If I drop a jewel when we talk you can keep it
Girl you on my mind all the time, that’s a secret"

People say I speak for generation Y
Why lie? I do, Section.80
Your son'll play me if radio won't
Daughters that just turn one 'til twenty-one listen to Kendrick
For instance
Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree
And do exactly what you see on TV
True story
Hmm
Can you repeat that for me, Soul?
See, a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
You know what all them things have in common?
Only half of the truth, if you tell it
See I spent twenty-three years on this earth searching for answers
'Til one day I realized I had to come up with my own
I'm not on the outside looking in
I'm not on the inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking center, looking around
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So, the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it
'Cause you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially-aware rapper
I am a human motherfuckin' being over dope-ass instrumentation

Could make forty off a brick, but one rhyme could beat that
And if somebody woulda told 'em that Hov would sell clothin'
Not in this lifetime, wasn't in my right mind
That's another difference that's between me and them
I smarten up, open the market up
One million, two million, three million, four

Got some shit on the free but this is shit that I wrote
Legendary like The Goat, who got game?
Give it a quarter rest while I make these quarter notes (Yeah!)
My album, niggas was expecting, now my water broke
Before it, I was sort of broke
Get the paper for the funnies (What?), sports and the horoscope
Order curry goat like Fluke Stokes order coke
You sharp with your rings and chain but you short of rope
At the end of the road trip still, I'mma hold shit down like syndrome
Rappers are like Fox Brown trying to get home
Barely get your touchdown, I'm in the end zone
You can't honor what I'm on, then bitch nigga get gone
Fuck the wind storm, my pen told the street folklore (What?)
Body language spoke raw
Don't talk to broads that are spoke for, that provoke war
Stand out like cold sores, claim you hard but you ho-core
George Bush and CIA you moving O's for (Yeah)
I write like Richard for publishing while you sold yours"
Jay-Z	12	Coming of Age (Da Sequel)	Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life	1998	[Verse 1]	"It seems, I'm like Keenan, picking up on the vibe
That he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes
I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividing the loot
Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute

Matching the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors

I hopped out in a suit"

Mama Earth is dying and crying because of you
Raining cats and jackals, all shackles disintegrate to residue
Silly mortals haven't a clue as to what the fuck is going on
I'm on the telephone dialing the Dungeon (""Hello?"")
This Dre, bring the MP and the SP
Meet me at the center of the Earth and travel carefully
Baby, grab the baby, 'cause baby, it ain't much time
Mama Earth is tossing and turning and that's a sign
Omega, nigga, I.F.O.s are landing in Decatur
Hope I'm not over your head, but if so, you will catch on later
Played the track, guess she could not take it anymo'
Raping her heavenly body like a ho, coochie so'

Never showing appreciation, busting nuts in her face when they done"

Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies

It's okay, go with him, Hailie (Dada?)"

You can spend the day with me
And we can roll and see the sights
It's going down tonight"
Common	22	Thisisme	Resurrection	1994	[Verse 3]	"Sometimes, sometimes, I get a good feeling!
When I'm chillin' at the flat, lookin' at the wall
Wondering can I come off of it, I'm off a bit
On the mic I be talkin' shit
But some say my talk don't make no Sense
I'm tryin' to make dollars
My momma told me to go to school and be a scholar
But school ain't for me
So don't even go there, I'm comin' out of nowhere to go where
Probably in about seven years, I won't have no hair
But not only am I the Hair Club President, I'm also a client
I come off like a toupee, I still have to pay 2Pc Dark
A Raider that never Lost the Ark, on the shot
But now when I shoot rock, I be all out of breath
My boy Adefo wanted to be a chef
But he went down South, and fell in love, call me love
'Cause love is gonna getcha — I'mma getcha!
I'm like B.J., my Arm is Strong and I Stretch ya
Styles from East to West, all across the country
I'm like that big fat woman 'cause cats wanna bump me
I probably would get bumped more if I was a gangster
But I am a gangsta, call me the gangsta of love
I love my music, I love my momma
I love myself, I love you, and you love me
And this is, I'm out"
Gang Starr	21	Robbin Hood Theory	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 1]	"I seek Sun, deceive none, for each one must teach one
At least one must flow and show the structure, of freedom
It's me Dunn, cause petty things we don't need 'em
Let's focus to create somethin great, for all that sees them
They innocent, they know not what they face
While politicians save face genius minds lay to waste
If I wasn't kickin rhymes I'd be kickin down doors
Creatin social change and defendin the poor
The God's always been militant, and ready for war
We're gonna snatch up the ringleaders send em home in they drawers
But first where's the safe at? Let's make em show us
And tell em hurry up, give up the loot that they owe us
We bringin it back, around the way to our peeps
Cause times are way too deep, we know the Code of the Streets
Meet your defeat; this is my Robin Hood Theory... my Robin Hood Theory"

Lupe Fiasco	23	Real	Lupe Fiasco’s Food & Liquor	2006	[Verse 3]	"Struggle, another sign that God love you
'Cause on the low, being poor make you humble
Keep they names in my rhymes to try and keep 'em out of trouble
'Cause being poor also teach you how to hustle
All they want is some shoes or some rims for they bubble
Now that I got my own I can hit 'em with a couple
Cuff my homies so they ain't got no reason to cuff you
That's my plan, if I can, on the Man up above you"
Scarface	11	Untouchable	The Untouchable	1997	[Verse 2]	"It's danger I'm standin' in the footsteps of danger
With a loaded Mac 11 stripped with rips in the chamber
The anger I aim the barrel of the hanger
Deep into the mind of this mutha fuckin stranger
I change ya outlook on living and I leave ya
Frozen starin' into space shakin' seizuring
I told ya the southside niggas roll deep
I showed ya the northside niggas don't sleep
Ya beat I'm coming down shootin up your section
You are now witnessing the gangster shit pure perfection
I'm old school O.G. niggas know me
From slanging' eightballs uncooked to moving whole keys
Now why these niggas wanna test my skills
I'm a killa and I chastise steel
To mix and mingle with this millionaire status
And send a motherfucker to hell when he fuck with Brad-it's
The killer instinct that never left me
The southside still true to the game little lefty is back
With shit that motherfuckers can't fade
Rhyming but still you motherfuckers ain't paid
So how can one try to see the unseen
Before you step your ass to the square know one thing
It's closed curtain we leavin' motherfuckers hurtin'
It's Rap-a-Lot Mafia life we all workin'
Punk we shut you down before you get it started
You can hate it but I'm goin' get mines and that's regardless- bitch
I got these niggas boo-hooin' like hoes
Jealous of the game I obtain and I chose
To exercise to the best of my ability
It ain't no motherfuckin' kill me
I'm Untouchable"
JAY-Z	6	U Don’t Know	The Blueprint	2001	[Verse 4]	"I sell ice in the winter, I sell fire in Hell
I am a hustler, baby, I'll sell water to a whale

Was born to dictate, never follow orders, dick face
Get your shit straight, fucker, this is Big Jay"
Big Boi	26	Jazzy Belle	ATLiens	1996	[Verse 2]	"See what if you was a playa, real playa not no flaw
Having the very best of life: lobster, steak and Perignon
Smoking an ounce of weed
And every single day was personal FreakNik
Tricking these hoes in Polo clothes, life as you conceived it
But your conception, deception, looking into your eyes
I see your weapon and it's depressing
They're digging up in your thighs, leaving deposits
Keeping your closets open, knocking your boots and drawers
Hoping to get you sprung like bail-bonds
Steadily calling me Antwan 'cause you thinking that you my lady
Bitch, don't play me 'cause you're janky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie, we got danky
So thank thee, for running that Southernplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame, a nigga don't even know yo' name
It's a shame, you cracking 'em up and fucking a nigga like 2Pac up (Damn)
I'm leaving these foes to be the flowers and wake don't get me
See, I gotta be feeding my daughter (Right)
Teach her to be that Natural Woman
'Cause you'll be Waiting to Exhale while you other hoes be Dumb
And Dumber, yeah, you know what I'm sayin'? Yeah"
Scarface	11	Greed	My Homies	1998	[Verse 2]	"Now say the nigga ran a Mickey D's
And made the money for the cracker who own it, shoulda did the shit for free
But now you got your hands out like Gretchen
You greedy motherfuckers want cash 'cause y'all left him
So now we lookin' at the short end of it
And bitches comin' up off they babies and y'all love it
They need to rewrite the law in every state
It's lovely when you do for child but what it take?
How come it got to be an income thing?
Claimin' they ain't got the income and then come change
And then you wonderin' the reason they left ya
'Cause she done had a talk with her friends and they didn't help
To realize it's just a dick thing
And with the money, she can play with herself, that's when the shit changed
It kinda starts a new outlook, don't it?
Especially when you offer the world and she ain't want it
And y'all tellin' me the men cheatin'?
We ain't as bad as you make us to be, 'cause y'all greedy"

The gangsta MAC, in a gangsta 'llac
Hmm.. fools be like, ""Break off some cheese""
Friends and enemies, aww nigga please
Fuck, you thought who pumped you up
Stop, you stuck too much, pop, drop, you plucked
It's all similar to gettin laid
On ya back when the motherfuckin' K sprays
I grind for my shine about my bidness
Lunatic on the shit and I get ignit (ignit)
Gonna proceed to squeeze with ease
One of these, they can't believe how I leave 'em
Look into a mind of a nigga that's crazy
Seventeen years old and still a baby
Gangstas real, they pop the pill
You cap back, young motherfucker it's like that"
Common	22	Nuthin’ to Do	Resurrection	1994	[Verse 1]	"My raps do laps around tracks and adapt
To any environment.. I'm the comma comma chameleon
I use to pop a wheelie on my blue and gray stingray, it had mags
That was when bitches had Gucci bags
And wasn't rockin' Starters, looking harder than niggas
Hoes wore clothes, that exposed they figures
8-7 stepped in the jam, next the police come
Fights there would be one, numbers I'd get at least one
We'd come to the get-together with whoever
You wouldn't know how deep we was, we all didn't sit together
Eat up all your vittles, drink your brew
And then step to the next cue, let's do it again y'all
That was when mad was tall and phat was cold
The days of Old Chicago and Fun Town
As shorties we run 'round, play strike outs till sun down
But the shit ain't as fun now, and the city's all run down
We'd troop down to Jew Town, talk a cat down on some gear
Have enough for a Polish and car fare
I stare, at what use to be better
And think about who use to cop our liquor
(Who?) Our neighborhood father figure"
André 3000	27	D.E.E.P.	Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik	1994	[Chorus]	"Deep, you wanna go deep, I'll take you deep
You know you fucked up when you let my mind creep
Deeper than the page of a book, let me look
You let me hit the stage, now I got my folks hooked
Like, deep, you wanna go deep, I'll take you deep
You know you fucked up when you let my mind creep
Deeper than the page of a book, let me look
You let me hit the stage, now I got my folks hooked

Nas	9	My Country	Stillmatic	2001	[Verse 3]	"Yo, I'm sittin' behind these prison walls
I got this pen and pad wishin' on a visit, God
Brothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape
Some brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape
How is the war, and, yo, I'm wishin' I was in your shoes
Holdin' machine guns, clean fun
Shootin' dudes with fatigues on
Anywhere is better than this
It's America's plan, every color of man inherits the shit
Yo, I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares
I know the warden is readin' the scribe, , courts, lawyers and jails
We all slaves in the system, I'm 'bout to rebel"

Wavy hair, chipped teeth
Up in this bitch deep, Queens murder cliques meet
Yellow tape on black gates
Mediterranean, projects is like Kuwait
I escape into zones that's irregular
Why debate on a phone? I'm solar cellular
Escobar 600
You just a crumb inside a world where the rich run it
Curriculum of a mathologist
Deep throats, they try to swallow this
Anthropologists, dynasties of great knowledgists I preserve in my dome
Niggas' mics is full of silicone, spot's blown
Guerilla ice on this killer's life, I put my word on it
Now you can sleep on or rock a swerve on it
Nas is ménage à trois on Mount Airy Lodges
We like a smooth fam, but rougher than how DeBarge is
Catchin' charges of marksmen, livin' heartless
Grab a cartridge, cock my shit on some Mobb shit
We mobbin', puttin' niggas in mausoleums
From Queens 'cross to Throgs Neck, heads bop, I see 'em!"

I see the head, Doc bustin through the door
He between the legs, he see the head, it's my baby boy!
11:46 the head out, she screamin makin crazy noise
Pain is love, my stomach foldin like a La-Z-Boy
I'm feelin like Mariah Carey, all these butterflies
Voices singin to me sound like Teena Marie
I'm callin niggas on tour
Jayo tell Spinz I just cut the umbilical cord
11:57, a soldier is born
And he's flesh of my flesh, young Harlem Caron"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Gotta Eat	Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool	2007	[Verse 3]	"Lovers call him King, haters call him Clown
He would say ""Bite me, that's the way it's going down""
He was having thoughts that maybe he should retire
Went to Church on a Sunday and saw a deep Friar
Said he had beef and people want him dead
He loved the hungry ones, was only scared of the Feds
He lived the fast life, couldn't get his path right
The Friar just told him 'bout the Hooters that he had last night
""Turn yourself in to the paddy wagon"", said ""No""
Bacon wouldn't take him, had the Pigs on the payroll"

You say you got the bomb? You wanna make a bet? it's on!
I blew about three zones then took baby home
Nigga what?! Motherfucker I'm grown
I have it how I want it, did it done it and stunted
Fronted a hundred to my nigga cause he want to get blunted
Ain't nothing to it, but to do it so I did it cause I'm wit it
This is the Face Off, the one hitter quitter
It'll lay you on your back fast, sweat start to trickle
Everything is moving like you on a tricycle
You caught up in the pickle but I get you out
I blow you a charge through your nose, not your mouth
Slow down! ho damn! you're doing too much
You're supposed to take two puffs then give the shit up, c'mon!"
Common	22	Reminding Me (Of Sef)	One Day It’ll All Make Sense	1997	[Verse 3]	"Nowadays, niggas is fake, like that party at McCormick Place
I don't draw with 'em, 'cause they was born to trace
At times, I contemplate movin' to a warmer place
Then the Lake and skyline give me a warm embrace
Remindin' me of the pointed parties Moe used to make
Six deep in the Hyundai bumpin' Twilight Tone tapes
Come home late, callin' broads, hang up on they mother
If it wasn't nowhere to scrap at, then we would fight each other
Get a room at the Dunes, havin' bakeouts
We'd eat at Giordano's and break out
Then, everybody thought that they could spend
High rollers had the MCM blazer blend
Girbauds and Guess jeans we was takin' and
Cranes and freight trains we was breakin' and
Tim'll be basin' Mike down at I.I.T
Rememberin' numbers depended on how high I'd be
It's a Deja-Brew, when I see bottles of Gill
My man Sef passed, I feel hollow but still"

Bunch of niggas around, I'm still by myself
I drift off on a cloud, by myself
Thinkin 'bout nothin more, than life - what else?
These days it's hard to tell who really cares for me
So when you hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day
If times are hard when you hear it, know you'll be okay
A O.G. told me God's favorites have a hard time
You're out the hood, that's good, now stay on the grind
I'm a sponge, knowledge, and wisdom I ab-sorb fast
I'm in a class by myself, you do the math"

Young with a lack on daily things
Never thought too much, homie, never trip
I got drunk as fuck, the homies blaze sticks
Look out for them niggas out to get you
It's a mistake forgetting to take your pistol with you (Your pistol, nigga)
Niggas get swallowed in the game
I cock and bust hollows to peer, duck and frame
Yo nigga, that shit sounds like I did it
Don't blaze the Indica without the Thai with it
Niggas look like they're doped up like tired bitches
With the eyes wide gone, you spit the harpoon
Wiping shit the fuck out, like typhoons
With the little homeboys, T-bone and cartoons (C'mon)
Motherfucker don't ask me for shit

Shorty, she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like that gotta be one of a kind (Woo)

You can't escape the tyrant, you can't relate where I've been
In '98, my problem: actin' too grown and shit
Cappin' at bitches, yeah, my religion through songs and shit
On me, that's on me
Raise up, nigga, you are not the homie
Bitch, I’m well-connected from my section down to Long Beach
Fumblin' with Tetris if your block neglectin' your ki
Every day, I wake up with my face up to my Father
Makin' sure my heart is pure enough to grow my seed and harvest
All my green and stuff and double up my plantation with dollar
Every dream is such reality, my déjà vu done caught up
Bitch, I'm brought up with the homies, that's on me
24/7, Kendrick reverend these cold streets
Dog, we live by it, die by it, then reincarnate
And if Game told me, ""Drive by it,"" I raise AK
Ain't no shame on it, cry about it, fuck that, I play
Like no name on it, blindsided, ain't no one safe
Documentary had identities of where I'm from
Therefore, my energy had to make sure the better me won
It ain't no better one, son, it ain't no tellin' me nothin'

Act now and get some action for a free-ninety-nine
Later on, I might charge for ménage
Heard her man was the boss of the floss
But she still want to toss me the drawers
And it ain't gon' cost me because
She my caddy 'cause she grab my golf balls in the club
And I'm still acting calm than a muh'

Always sprayin' TEC's, because I be stayin' vexed
Some nigga named Dex was in the projects layin' threats
I jumped out the Lincoln, left him stinkin'
Put his brains in the street, now you can see what he was just thinkin'
I'm chokin' enemies 'til they start turnin' pale
Satan said I'm learnin' well, Big L's gonna burn in Hell
Front and get scarred 'cause your rap style ain't even hard
I run with a thieving squad and none of us believe in God"
Eminem	15	Brain Damage	The Slim Shady LP	1998	[Verse 2]	"Way before my baby daughter Hailie
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named DeAngelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
So every day he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef
But he just wouldn't leave
He kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, ""You gonna die, honky""
The principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me
(What's going on in here?)
I made 'em think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four-inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools
This is for every time you took my orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home later that same day
Started readin' a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read
I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin', ""What are you on, drugs?!
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug"" (I'm sorry)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed, ""Look, bitch, what have you done?""
""Oh my God, I'm sorry, son""
Shut up, you cunt
I said fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck"
André 3000	27	Ms. Jackson	Stankonia	2000	[Chorus]	"I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologized a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologized a trillion times"
Nas	9	Not Going Back	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Verse 1]	"Yeah, my man Kool G Rap told me, ""Son, do not look back""
Chill up in the mansion with a fat glutious max, relax
When people act, school em' with facts, tell 'em
At this point in my life I'm all about chillin'
Ridin' around in something sick and the dress flies
And twist, homie's hermano just died, I gotta let it ride
That's what I got the public thinkin', my nigga
Just ‘cause I ain't in the hood don't mean shit, my nigga
I know who died before the body dropped
I know the guns that were used
How much money the shooter got
‘Cause on the private yacht I'm still within earshot of it all
The top ten list of the most grimiest guys of all time
Is all we talk when we talk in New York, y'all
Who to call and who to stay away from
Whose mother's address to have just to play it safe, son
Women they lust up so quick to give 'em up
What cars and what trucks they drive in
What towns they spend the most time in when they grindin'
I found out most of them are cowards
They hidin' behind reputations that's sour; I'm not going back"
Eminem	15	Leaving Heaven	Music to Be Murdered By	2020	[Verse 1]	"Five dozen flies buzzin' over your head
Call me the Grim Reaper, sleep is my cousin
You're dead to me now and I'ma be the last face you see
'Fore you die 'cause in (Yep)
My eye are tigers and I'm a survivor so I will rise up and (What?)
Be triumphant 'cause when I'm looking at my legacy (Leg, I see)
Bunch of dogs tryna dry hump it
Like Triumph The Puppet, so I'm like, ""Fuck it""
Pile the carnage up 'til it's so high, it's touching the sky
Let 'em all line up and attack
Single filing up in the stack
Call 'em toy soldiers (Yeah)
'Cause they just wind up on their backs
Now the sky's nothing but black
But I am not coming back, I done told ya
I told the woke me to go to sleep
But still, they keep on provoking me
They're hoping to see me completely broken emotionally
But how in the fuck am I not supposed to be woke
When these fuckers just keep poking me? Now"
JAY-Z	6	Moonlight	4:44	2017	[Verse 1]	"Look, I know killers, you no killer, huh?
Bathing Ape maybe not a gorilla, huh?
Glorified seat filler, huh?
Stop walkin' around like y'all made Thriller, huh?
Fake Dracos all in the videos
We show 'em, we shoot 'em in my city though
I don't post no threats on the Internet
I just pose a threat, blame Lenny S for that
I don't be on the 'Gram goin' ham
Givin' information to the pork, that's all spam
Please don't talk about guns that you ain't never gon' use
Y'all always tell on y'all self, I'm just so fuckin' confused"

MC Ren	17	Fuck tha Police	Straight Outta Compton	1988	[Verse 2]	"Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, ""Fuck you, punk!""
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound (*Gunshots*)
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin' out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say"

Are you a freak? So am I
So could we see, eye to eye?"
Guru	20	Above the Clouds	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 1]	"I-Self-Lord-And-Master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters shall be captured by kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
With a force that can't be compared
To any firepower, for it's mind power shared
The brainwave causes vessels to circulate
Like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the Father and Mother Earth
Seekin' everlastin' life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look, listen and observe
And watch another C-Cipher pullin' my peeps to the curb
Heed the words, it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turnin' a desert to a well
Experience — the best teacher
Thoughts will spray like street sweepers, little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck, plus the DJ you respect
The seven-and-a-half combined, over the front line
The ten-percenters promotin' slander in their airtime
Bear in mind, jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp blades, heavenly praise and dues are paid"
The Game	13	LA	The Documentary 2	2015	[Verse 4]	"It's time to blackout, time to spit this crack out
Niggas been fiending for this shit, Aftermath a crack house
The way I spit, niggas'll think I pulled the MAC out
I said the way I spit, niggas'll think I blew J-Lo back out
Still Compton nigga, fuck y'all thought I went on vacation?
Same nigga that used to break in houses and steal PlayStations
I hate waiting
I told Dre to put out Detox, or I'ma do it
This is that nigga, The Chronic mixed with embalming fluid
Bring your chin here blood, so I can put this llama to it
Disrespectful nigga, see this window? I send your mama through it
Do it for the coast, so we can toast to it
Who showed you all the Pirus, the SA's and how the Los do it?
Similar to how the vice lords and folks do it
You remember Bump J, out west? I'm the closest to it
Put on for my city bitch 'cause I'm supposed to do it
Straight Outta Compton, I'm the fucking movie poster to it, nigga

Kendrick Lamar	16	Real	good kid, m.A.A.d city	2012	[Verse 2]	"I promise that I know you very well
Your eyes never lie, even if they fell
Out the sky and your optics turn stale
Where they mold that's green, I can see you fit the bill
Of living in a world that come with plan B
'Cause plan A only can make another mistake
And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women, you love keepin' control
Of everything that you love, you love beef
You love streets, you love running, ducking police
You love your hood, might even love it to death
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?"

2Pac	18	Fuck the World	Me Against The World	1995	[Verse 2]	"When I was comin' up rough that wasn't even what you called it
That's why I smoke blunts now and run with alcoholics
I'm gettin' threats to me comin' from my enemies
And in their dreams it's hell where they sendin' me
Have I lost control or just another soul?
A car full of motherfuckers when we roll
Sippin' on 'gnac as I sit back, life as a big mack
Brothers come up and say ""you did that?""
Never take your eyes off the prize and even if you gettin' high
Don't ever hesitate to try
'Cause you can fall off or stay ballin', niggas, we all in
And them my motherfuckers callin'
Fuck the world!"

Eminem	15	Must Be the Ganja	Relapse	2009	[Verse 2]	"Your dreams are gettin' fulfilled, ooh, I'm literally gettin' a chill
Spittin' at will, me and Dre have just finished splittin' a pill
You're submittin' to skill, sittin' still
I'm admittin' I'm beginnin' to feel like I don't think anyone's real
Faced with a dilemma: I can be Dalai Lama
And be calm or bring drama, a step beyond of Jeffrey Dahmer
Please don't upset me, mama, you're lookin' sexy, mama
Don't know if it's the lala or the rum and Pepsi, mama
Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra topping the next time I make a pizza
How many people you know who can name every serial
Killer who ever existed in a row?
Put 'em in chronological order, beginnin' with Jack the Ripper
Name the time and place; from the body, the bag, the zipper
Location of the woods, where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they were stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate
And which model, which lake they found her in, how they attacked the victim
Say which murder weapon was used to do what in which one
Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife, and which nun
Don't stop, I like this, it's fun, the fuckin' night's just begun"
Guru	20	New York Strait Talk	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 2]	"True if you can make it out here, you can make it anywhere
That means a lot of rappers, they should stay away from here
Cause we still care, about the total artform
Niggas could sell more records but they still can't flip a live forum
Plus everybody out here ain't talkin true shit either
Mad niggas is fakin jacks, I don't like them neither
But the competition keeps me on point
That's why I lamp in the studio composin fresh new joints
From the streets, Medina, Manhattan, Staten, Pelan
The struggle continues, everybody wants to be on
The rat race, makes this lifestyle fast paced
I've loved it since the days of fat shoelace
Screwface me all you want, but I'm used to it
I'll never give up reppin New York, I'm true to it
From forty-deuce to Queens, back to East New Yi
We takin no shorts, and plus we showin no pity
Bright lights, big city and the dark alleyways
New York, we get the money all day everyday"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Intruder Alert	Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool	2007	[Verse 1]	"She said there was no love in her heart
'Cause one day a rapist attacked her and broke that all apart
She said there was no way to fix it or to cover her scars
Then one day a guy came along that probably could help her start
He was sincere, made her believe it was safe for her to trust again
Before long, she was cool with givin' hugs to him
Knew that it was right 'cause somethin' was wrong
The alarms in her mind didn't tell her he didn't belong
There was no"

Heartbroken, she walked right out of mad nigga's life
So when I bagged her up right, I had to make her my wife
And I ain't gonna lose her like those other lames did
I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big
She keep me jig, glorifying medallions
Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions
Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked
She been around for years, know the hustlers, pimps, and macks
Bankers and diplomats

We hit the bodega got her a few 40's
We jumped in my ride we drove and she cried
Twisted off the cap there and opened her mouth wide
Swallowed it, whole bottle's half empty
Drinks like a fish, now she's past tipsy
The truth came out as we got to her suave house
Chopped and screwed her mouth and sat me on the couch
I said, ""It's gettin late, come on, give it to me straight
Who's ya sponsor lady?"" She says, ""Bill Gates.""
What are ya born '77 or '78?
She says, ""Nah it goes way to an earlier date
Slave times,"" claims the slaves said rhymes

Was born in West Savannah way before I started rappin'
My mamma had a nigga at the age of fifteen
My daddy was sellin' that sack, now he's gots responsibilities
Stayed at me granny's while me mammy was at work
And she couldn't watch my every move so shit I started servin'
Around Frazier Home, down in the Westside projects
Changin' over foodstamps, and hittin' a lick was next see
I'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So flyin', or floatin', a Brougham is what I'm sportin'
Sade is in my tape deck, I'm moving in slow motion, boi
So meet me deep in the streets that's where I learned the capers
Us lickin' blunts, lickin' leaves, rolling reefer papers
I'm slightly slouched, in the seats off in my bucket
But the niggas around the Ave. and the hoes, they love me (Yeah)
They wanna be me and my family too
Because the money that I make be puttin' cable off in every room
So follow the fiends, follow my lead through the nooks and crannies
It's everyday life off in my hood so come and holla at me
But go 'head on, with that foolishness bitch
Let me get lovely with my swerve because I'm true to this shit
And if you coming with eight dollars, you shit out of luck
Because the Westside ain't taking no shorts on the dime
So fire it up"

Eric B. & Rakim	14	Put Your Hands Together	Follow the Leader	1988	[Verse 1]	"This is for thousands of people who came
A show from road to road, you're entertained
I don't even have to say my name
'Cause when the place is ripped in half, I'm to blame
Masses of posses packed up, schemin'
Ladies lovely and keep on screamin'
Go Rakim, go Rakim, go
It won't be long, then it's on with the show
I'm late, so hit the brakes and park the Benzito
007, incognito
Sneak in the back door, lookin' for the stage
When I get on, you react in a rage
People from side to side and front to back
Won't dance if the MC's wack
The crowd go psycho even if I don't move
Some like the groove 'cause I'm so smooth
Then somethin' happens, feet start tappin'
You can't hold back when Rakim's rappin'
The man you've been waitin' for, rougher than ever
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together"
Big L	25	No Endz, No Skinz	Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous	1995	[Verse 2]	"Girls in the '90s ain't nothin' but crooks
It's all about what's in your pockets, not how you look
That's why you can't talk to just any whore
Leavin' brothers for the next man 'cause he got a penny more
They want a drug dealer, not a scholar
Some girls barely speak but always askin' for a dollar
And if you pushin' a fresh Benz, they'll be your best friends
Yeah, as long as you collect ends
You think she's all yours
But as soon as your dough go, your ho go, now you solo
But when you was makin' papes sellin' jumbos
You bought dumb clothes for all of them bum hoes
And you was takin' 'em to the movies every weekend
Now that you're dead broke, the girls stop speakin'
'Cause nowadays, girls want you to trick
The only thing they can get from Big L is a big—
'Cause when you on top, everything's okay
But when you broke, you gets no play"

Big Pun	24	You Ain’t a Killer	Capital Punishment	1998	[Verse 2]	"You've made a grave mistake, shouldn't have come here, you changed your fate
Your brains'll make their debut on the table when I raise the stakes
The pain is great, but only for a second
It starts strong, then lessens just when you restin', the Armaggedon sets in
Left him with so much stress (T.S.), blessed him with no regrets (yes)
Welcome to Hell, son, the threshold of death
Face the serpent that blaze your person, you get laced for certain
Leavin' Jakes no trace to work from close the case like curtains
I'm hurtin' heads severely, really tryna bring the pain
There's nothin' more satisfyin' than when you cryin', screamin' my name
It's not a game, it's Purple Rain, floods of bloodstains
Big Pun's my thug's name, bustin' my guns, that's my love thing
I'll slit your jug' vein and snatch your Adam's Apple
John Madden-tackle your corpse to hoist it on a cross at the tabernacle
That'll have to hurt, I'll work your body 'til it burst
Then curse tu vida like a Brujería verse
I'm worse than anything you ever been through, sick in the head and mental
Essentially meant to be the sole threat against you
When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken
Fakin' like you Satan, when I'm the rhymin' abomination"
Dr. Dre	1	Niggaz 4 Life	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Verse 2]	"Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
I guess it's just the way shit has to be
Back when I was young gettin' a job was murder
Fuck flippin' burgers, cause I deserve a
Nine-to-five I can be proud of, that I can speak loud of
And to help a nigga get out of
Yo! The concrete playground
But most motherfuckers only want you to stay down
But I'm a smart motherfucker you see
One of the best producers in the rap music industry
Gettin' paid like a motherfucker
A young brother, who don't give a fuck about another
Yeah"
André 3000	27	Babylon	ATLiens	1996	[Verse 1]	"I came into this world high as a bird
From secondhand cocaine powder—I know it sounds absurd
I never tooted, but it's in my veins
While the rest of the country bungies off bridges without no snap-back
And, bitches, they say they need that to shake they fannies in the ass clubs
They go the other route, turn each other out, burn each other out
Where a bona fide nigga like me can't even get no backrub these days
Ain't that bleak on they part?
But let me hold it down, 'cause they shut you down when you speak from your heart—now that's hard
While we rantin' and ravin' 'bout gats
Nigga, they made them gats, they got some shit that'll blow out our backs from where they stay at"
Eminem	15	So Far...	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Chorus]	"Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I could never turn my back on a city that made me
And"
Eminem	15	If I Had	The Slim Shady LP	1997	[Chorus]	"But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics (If I had a million dollars)
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on while I'm on the john (I could set my troubles free)
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough 'cause I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks (If I had a million dollars)
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Silent Hill	Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers	2022	[Chorus]	"Push these niggas off me like, ""Huh""

I put dope on my block, make the dope flip
I got work on me, nigga, I got dog shit
Get you hit in yo' shit, it won't cost shit
Take a load and run through it in one minute
With that mud in my system, I function
Took her freestyle and turned it to cash
I get fly to you, this not a caption
When I got in this shit, I got hot in this shit
I came through in a coupe, I was smashin'
I was good in the hood servin' 'phetamine
Gettin' a billion to see what's ahead of me
My real day ones, they ready catch felonies
Goin' Richard Mille for the whole team
Tote a stick and throw dice at the curb
Ho, go fuck on a nigga I birthed
If she lose, that's a choice and a curse
You lil' niggas, I take you to church"
Kendrick Lamar	16	man at the garden	GNX	2024	[Verse 3]	"Put a smile on my mama
Good health and good karma
Yeah, she deserves it all
One hundred murals out in Compton
Remember me? I kept my promise
Yeah, we deserve it all
A better life for my daughter
Made my son take it further than his father
Yeah, he deserves it all
A close relationship with God
Whisper to me every time I close my eyes
He say, ""You deserve it all""
Keep these bitch niggas away from me
Keep all my blessings faithfully
Keep my essence contagious, that's okay with me
I burn this bitch down, don't you play with me or stay with me
I'm crashin' out right now, no one's safe with me
I did it with integrity and niggas still try hate on me, just wait and see
More blood be spillin', it's just paint to me
Dangerously, nothin' changed with me, still got pain in me
Flip a coin, want the shameless me or the famous me?
How annoying, does it angers me to know the lames can speak
On the origins of the game I breathe? That's insane to me
It's important, I deserve it all because it's mine
Tell me why you think you deserve the greatest of all time, motherfucker"

Or catch a buck shot to your dome piece
I must warn — I got it goin' on, word is bond
Ducks be gettin' thrown off platforms like PM Dawn
I'm catchin' bodies like a villain's supposed to
And I squeeze triggers — not just on niggas, but hoes too
So don't try to test me, 'cause I can't stand testers
Fuck around, I'll introduce you to your ancestors
Step to this and get left with a face full of tears, pal
But man, you've been rappin' for years now
And ain't made a hit yet, you flop in a split sec
In the shower's the only time you get your dick wet
I roll with scary crews, I come outta wars barely bruised
I'm puttin' motherfuckers on the Daily News
I was a gangsta from the get-go
Leavin' fags in body-bags with tags on they big toe"

And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or going broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it

And I'm known to milk freaks and hit 'em on silk sheets
No dame can give me a bad name, I got mad fame
I'm quick to put a slug in a fag brain
I be placin' snitches inside lakes and ditches
And if I catch AIDS, then I'ma start rapin' bitches
I'm all about makin' papes, kid
I killed my mother with a shovel just like Norman Bates did
My old man in the past stuck me up without a mask
Then his ass cold dashed with my cash fast
Fifty G's is what the creep stole
So the next day, knocked on his door
And shot his granny through the peephole
That's the type of shit I'm on, word is bond
Got it goin' on, from the break of dawns to the early morn'
You know my style, I'm wild
Comin' straight outta Harlem, pal
It's Big L, the motherfuckin' problem child"

Yeah, I'm on the west, yeah, I'm on the west side
Off the drugs, know I'm not the best guy
But you know I always get it done, yeah
You done had all of the rappers, I'm the one, yeah
Ain't gon' lie, I remember how it feels, yeah
I ain't gon' lie, I'ma tell you this for real (Woah)
Split a pack of the woods down
Ride with me, yeah, you wish you could now
Always come and go and never fail
It was never love, I can tell now
She pop 'em up, Blue Chanel just to get it up
Parking lot full of foreign hoes on the regular
With them painted toes in them heels
Let's go find a place that's far from here, for real
Far from here"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Institutionalized	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 1]	"Life, can be like, a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I'll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses
So many Rollies around you and you want all of 'em
Somebody told me you thinkin' 'bout snatchin' jewelry
I should've listened when my grandmama said to me:"

Inter-century anthems based off inner-city tantrums
Based off the way we was branded
Face it, Jerome get more time than Brandon
And at the airport, they check all through my bag
And tell me that it's random
But we stay winning
This week has been a bad massage, I need a happy ending
And a new beginning and a new fitted
And some job opportunities that's lucrative
This the real world, homie, school finished
They done stole your dreams, you don't know who did it
I treat the cash the way the government treats AIDS
I won't be satisfied 'til all my niggas get it, get it?"

My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'

Strategies on how to be great amongst the averages
I picked his brain on what was ordained, highly collaborative
RET pushed the label the same, amongst the savages
Moose kept my name in the function that he would run in
TEEZ kept the vultures away from me that was comin'
Sounwave let me borrow his clothes for shows as a hype man
To cook up in this room 'til the night ends
Time flies, I'm carryin' debates of a top five
Buryin' my opps and allies
But I'd done a half job communicatin' feelings of being stagnant
Life was gettin' bigger than just rappin'
The business, what I was lackin'
Top used to record me back when it was poor me
And now we at the round table for what assures me
I guess my motivation was the yearnin' for independence
Poured everything I had left in the family business
Now it's about Kendrick, I wanna evolve, place my skillset as a Black exec'
I jog my memory, knowin' Black Hippy didn't work 'cause of me
Creatively, I moved on with new concepts in reach
Top, remember all them sessions we would strategize
To hit the streets, then come back, record three records? Ah
To tell the truth, it fucked me up when D-Man passed
The motive was the condolences, but the pride crashed
I had to bypass old mythologies I had
Put my heart on display like it was an iMac
To all my young niggas, let me be the demonstration
How to conduct differences with a healthy conversation
If that's your family, then handle it as such
Don't let the socials gas you up or let emotions be your crutch
Pick up the phone and bust it up before the history is lost
Hand-to-handshake is good when you have a heart-to-heart"

I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin' Big Willie style

Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames, plus the games people play

Travis Scott	33	I Can Tell	Rodeo	2015	[Verse 2]	"Yeah, I can tell 'bout the night tales
And all the dry wells, and all the long roads
And all my ideas before the cornrows (Straight up)
How we came up and how we came down
Goin' donuts, coffee couldn't help now (La Flame)
How we zoned out? Made it out the hood now
And what it do when they wanna be your friend now? (Oh, no)
How to get it, how to live and get it in now?
How to go from scrapin' profits, makin' his demand now?
I been impulsive, non-emotional, stayin' humble 'bout it (Yeah)
Tilt the posture, sick, pass the bottle (Yeah)
504 Hot Boyz, minus the bad rap like Silkk the Shocker (Yeah)
But I'ma pull up the silk, to shock her with the silk
Nigga, you know I been a rocker, drippin' milk and knockers
Take it up another notcher, take it up another notcher (Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot)
I top a—, pop a pill, pop a seal to forget about ya, I'll bumbaclot you, bumba—bumba—blocka shot ya (Brrah-brrah-brrah-brrah-brrah)
Bling-and-bang-a, bang a rapper, bangarang, I brought my money back, orangutan
Diamonds hangin' on my nang-a-lang (Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot), bitches hangin' on my dang-a-lang (Straight up), yeah"
Eminem	15	Brainless	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Chorus]	"""If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous"" (I'ma prove you wrong)
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus (I'ma be the bomb)
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness (Momma always said)
""Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous""
Guess it pays to be brainless"
OutKast	28	When I Look in Your Eyes	Idlewild	2006	[Verse 3]	"Sometimes I'm just a clown

Kendrick Lamar	16	The Spiteful Chant	Section.80	2011	[Pre-Chorus 2]	" be going big, bitch, suck my dick
Yeah, I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick
Tell 'em I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick
Yeah, I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Mother I Sober	Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers	2022	[Verse 3]	"I was never high, I was never drunk, never out my mind
I need control, they handed me some smoke, but still I declined
I did it sober sittin' with myself, I went through all emotions
No dependents, except for one, let me bring you closer
Intoxicated, there's a lustful nature that I failed to mention
Insecurities that I project, sleepin' with other women
Whitney's hurt, the purest soul I know, I found her in the kitchen
Askin' God, ""Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?""
Broke me down, she looked me in my eyes, ""Is there an addiction?""
I said ""No,"" but this time I lied, I knew that I can't fix it
Pure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me
Gave me a number, said she recommended some therapy
I asked my momma why she didn't believe me when I told her ""No""
I never knew she was violated in Chicago, I'm sympathetic
Told me that she feared it happened to me, for my protection
Though it never happened, she wouldn't agree
Now I'm affected, twenty years later trauma has resurfaced
Amplified as I write this song, I shiver 'cause I'm nervous
I was five, questioning myself, 'lone for many years
Nothing's wrong, just results on how them questions made me feel
I made it home, seven years of tour, chasin' manhood
But Whitney's gone, by time you hear this song, she did all she could
All those women gave me superpowers, what I thought I lacked
I pray our children don't inherit me and feelings I attract
A conversation not bein' addressed in Black families
The devastation, hauntin' generations and humanity
They raped our mothers, then they raped our sisters
Then they made us watch, then made us rape each other
Psychotic torture between our lives, we ain't recovered
Still livin' as victims in the public eyes who pledge allegiance
Every other brother has been compromised
I know the secrets, every other rapper sexually abused
I see 'em daily buryin' they pain in chains and tattoos
So listen close before you start to pass judgment on how he move
Learn how he cope, whenever his uncle had to walk him from school
His anger grows deep in misogyny
This is post-traumatic Black families and a sodomy, today is still active
So I set free myself from all the guilt that I thought I made
So I set free my mother all the hurt that she titled shame
So I set free my cousin, chaotic for my mother's pain
I hope Hykeem made you proud 'cause you ain't die in vain
So I set free the power of Whitney, may she heal us all
So I set free our children, may good karma keep them with God
So I set free the hearts filled with hatred, keep our bodies sacred
As I set free all you abusers, this is transformation"
50 Cent	19	I’m So Hood	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Chorus]	"I'm so hood, I can't help it
I'm so hood, I can't help it
Love me for bein' me, 'cause I can't change it
Can't rearrange it, I am what I am
So love me for bein' me
I'm so hood, I can't help it
I'm so hood, I can't help it
Love me for bein' me, 'cause I can't change it
Can't rearrange it, I am what I am
So love me for bein' me"
The Game	13	Dedicated	The Documentary 2	2015	[Verse 3]	"Compton ain't the same
Where all these bitch niggas come from?
Can’t even take a fade or ride through the hood
Without niggas hands out like they want some
But where you at when I need you?
See most of these niggas see through
You throw up a P, I throw up a P too
You pulling out heat, I draw the heat too
Compton made me like this, nigga
Fuck all these bitches, get money and die
Hundred niggas in my section, hundred Rollies in the sky
There's a hundred little niggas that will bang on a nigga
Put the flame on a nigga, take chains from a nigga
That will go BG, Turk and Wayne on a nigga
When the club get cloudy let it rain on a nigga
We are with the shit, let us redefine lit
That’s in the club smoking on extendos, extendo with the clip
Standing on the couch like wah
Backwood hanging out my mouth like wah
Who the fuck want a problem?
Once you’re shot, leave a nigga dead on an island
Creep out the back door with my side bitch, aye"
Kanye West	5	Barry Bonds	Graduation	2007	[Verse 1]	"It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?

I can't even explain it, I surprise myself, too"
Nas	9	Some of Us Have Angels	Nastradamus	1999	[Verse 1]	"Now this is you, dressed in all black, fatigue hat, ready for combat
A good nigga, you don't leave tracks
A hood nigga wantin' G-stacks, do what you gotta do to get that
You feel you need that, where the juxs at?
These are your niggas, creepin' they be leavin' niggas sleep wit' you
Loc' style, quiet no smile, it's the official
Sometime they grimy, speakin' on their own people
They snake you if they have to, raised tattoos
Now these are your bitches, phonin' lonely homie chickens
All the homies stick 'em, you think you own 'em man, listen
She stab you in your sleep with a knife from out the kitchen
Put a root on you, next week they find you missin'
Dead in your Expedition in the forest, fell off the cliff and
Tumbled 'til you blew up, Feds told her and she threw up
Fake bitches, actresses, wicked witch practices
Two sides of us, negative and positive"
Nas	9	We Will Survive	I Am...	1999	[Outro]	"Always survive, always
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive

Still, we, will survive (no matter what)
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my niggas just stay alive"
Eminem	15	Beautiful	Relapse	2009	[Verse 1]	"I'm just so fucking depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down then I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt
To vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that
I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:
I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—"
Nas	9	Smokin’	Stillmatic	2001	[Chorus]	"Now tell me, what y'all smokin'?
What kinda heat y'all holdin'?
Well, is your creep move potent?
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas, come on
We bi-coastin', keepin' our pockets bulgin'
We got the plan in motion
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas, come on"

Kendrick Lamar	16	Hood Politics	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 1]	"I don't give a fuck about no politics in rap, my nigga
Our lil' homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin' back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout, your shit is where it's at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game, your hood, your name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts, now, here, if them Benjamins go cuddle up
Skip, hop, drip, drop
Flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes, ""Sherm sticks, burn this""
That's what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
50-nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
El Co's, Monte Carlos, Road Kings, and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you"
Kanye West	5	Real Friends	The Life of Pablo	2016	[Verse 2]	"I couldn't tell you how old your daughter was (Was)
Couldn't tell you how old your son is (Is)
I got my own Jr. on the way, dawg (Dawg)
Plus I already got one kid (Kid)
Maybe 15 minutes, took some pictures with your sister
Merry Christmas, then I'm finished, then it's back to business
You wanna ask some questions 'bout some real shit? (Shit)
Like I ain't got enough pressure to deal with (With)
Please don't pressure me with that bill shit (Shit)
Niggas thinkin' I'm crazy, you defendin' me
It's funny I ain't spoke to niggas in centuries
To be honest, dawg, I ain't feelin' your energy"
Eminem	15	Beautiful	Relapse	2009	[Pre-Chorus]	"In my shoes, just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes"
Nas	9	Who Killed It?	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Outro]	"Listen up sweetheart now we gettin somewhere

Travis Scott	33	NO BYSTANDERS	ASTROWORLD	2018	[Verse 1]	"Bicentennial man, put the city on slam
She get trippy off Xans, lost twenty-one grams
And she did it on cam, wasn't no video dance
Make my own rules, I really don't pick, I just choose
I don't set picks, I just shoot
Chopped and get screwed
I told her it's B.Y.O.B., that mean buy your own boobs
Put it on God, He the one that put me on top
Can't be put in a box, gotta move on the opps
Devil got the move on the drop
Niggas tryna move on the Scott
And move that deep, tryna run down, shit's steep
Gotta act a fool with the squad
Next city, no sleep, back to the 7-1-3"

Yo soy El Rey de fuckin' California

Tu es muy bonita, te extrano my Señorita
Me es de negro Vicente Fernandez
Mi cuarenta y cinco, I need you to understand this
California ain't No Country for Old Men
Muy grande, sangre, ridin' on chrome rims
Translation, Asanti deuce deuce's
Mirando en la esquina, St. Luces
I'm 'bout to lose it holmes, Espera
Escribo Los Angeles en mi cara
Time to bring back my old Impala
Keep the 40 in the dash for them Eric Estrada's
Tu got pajaros then holla'

Nas	9	Small World	I Am...	1999	[Chorus]	"It's a small world (It's a...)
Nigga you reap what you sow (...Small world)
What goes around comes around, if you sleep you won't know
A very small world (It's a...)
Where beef never ends (...Small world)
At the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again

Lupe Fiasco	23	Blackout (Circuit City Bonus Track)	Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool	2007	[Verse 3]	"So this light's out, like a lighthouse
In the daytime, make it lay down
Make it go to bed, make it go to sleep
Like Deebo, when he was chokin' Craig
That's a headlock, it's what I said I got
The whole game in, like shooter box
Then the Sho Kosugi, if you don't know the movies
I ninja vanish, Michael Dudikoff
I get super low, I get super lost
I be super cool, like a super boss
Say they super bad, but they super soft
Like super chicken, without the super sauce
Let's step out, it's a rap now
Blow your candles, and your lamps out
When I pull up, you can pull the plug
Cause it's game over, it's a black out"
The Game	13	Scream on Em	Doctor’s Advocate	2006	[Verse 3]	"My flow opposite of handsome, it's ugly
Hip hop tantrum, sick, call the shit cancer
One man show cause I fucked all the dancers
Let the critics ask questions, my album be the answer
These niggas let the rumors sit in they head like tumors
So I had to take 'em back, to toothbrush on the Pumas
Clean... mean... rappin machine
Red rag hangin low in the back of my jeans
I black out like February, back out what's necessary
Oh-seven Bugatti with Jimmy Iovine's secretary
I'm runnin the buildin, don't make me run in the buildin
No this ain't the first time I had my gun in the buildin
Walkin past offices I see my son in the buildin
Last album on the wall I'm number one in the buildin
They should build me an office up under the buildin
My elevator goin down, I am done in the buildin nigga"
Gang Starr	21	Moment of Truth	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 3]	"Yo, I got one lyric pointed at your head for start
Another one is pointed at your weak-ass heart
Now if I pull the trigger on these fully-loaded lines
You're gonna wish I would've pulled a black 9
I mack dimes, crack the spines of the fake gangsters
Yeah the bitin' triflin' niggas and the studio pranksters
Yo, lookin' at the situation plainly: will you remain, G?
Or will you be looked upon strangely?
I reign as the articulator with the greater data
Revolvin' on the TASCAM much doper than my last jam
While others struggle to juggle tricky metaphors
I explore more to expose the core
A lot of emcees act stupid to me
And we have yet to see if they can match our longevity
But anyway, it's just another day
Another fake jack I slay with my spectac' rap display
Style's smooth but rugged, you can't push or shove it
You dig it and you dug it 'cause like money you love it
The king of monotone, with my own throne
Righteously violent prone, my words bring winds like cyclones
Stormin' your hideout, blockin' out your sunlight
Your image and your business were truly not done right
Throw up your He Allah Now Divine Saviors
You got no hand skills, there's no security to save ya
No pager, no celly, no drop top Benz-y
I came to bring your phony hip-hop to an ending
My art of war will leave you sore from the abuse
'Cause you must meet your moment of truth"
Future	30	That’s It	Pluto x Baby Pluto	2020	[Chorus]	"Look through the ice in this platinum, I did a one-eighty, I went up the wrong way
Look at the bezel, it twinkle and glisten and shine, you gon' need you some sunblock (Coco)
Thousands of grams on grams and certified stones, it came on a timeclock (For sure, though)
All of my whoadies coyotes, we stickin' together, we comin' like shottas (Let's go)
Put a tracker on that bitch if you love her, 'cause she comin' through like a goon squad (Woah, woah)
I put it on, then it's over, I got different designers all over
Coupes on coupes, chop the top off the Rolls-Royce truck, you know it's gon' be over (Woah)

But even my mom talk about him bad
She says since he blew up, he changed for sure
He's really fascinated with these fancy hoes
I don't know why but there personalities collide
And my dad will swallow blood before he swallows his pride
You know the kids in my class they be sayin he's crazy
They just like him cause he roll with Dr. Dre and Shady"
Dr. Dre	1	Forgot About Dre	2001	1999	[Verse 3]	"If it was up to me, you motherfuckers'd stop
Comin' up to me with your hands out
Lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton (Compton)
I told 'em all
All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, 'cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch"
Nas	9	You Can’t Kill Me	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Verse 2]	"High, fly, send a fella loaf or glass
Fold up cash, you ain't heard the soldier's half
You speakin' hogwash, silly shit, Balderdash
I got the live sparked, Phillies lit, smoker's jacket on
The son of a Cap-ricorn, my dad's a don
What you think that he spawned? A slacker? Nah
Packed the 9's, yo this nigga's asinine
Smack your mom, relaxed and calm, then mack your mom
In a casket, you'll get your fashion on
You'll be in a suit and tie, you'll die
You'll make maggots turn to flies, fuckin' with Nas
Remember anyone can get it at anytime
Lames'll swear by your name, when they lie
Get hit with the lone star, ripped where your bones are
So tell me how yo' ass gon' run, from a C-Z-P-0-1?
In the midst of real steel movers, you a loser
Merk you wit your own shooters
All you want is a name, pissed and insane
My security system, my playspot a fireplace, listen
Then it goin' off, start spittin'
Niggas try to bring it where I live in
Trustin' you, knew where all of the cribs at
So we waited with the Sigs, blat, blat, blat!"
Kendrick Lamar	16	DNA.	DAMN.	2017	[Verse 2]	"Tell me somethin'
You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder, these are the breaks
These are the times, level number nine
Look up in the sky, ten is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder our DNA"

Tryin' to get my shoot on, so I'ma scoot on
Over to the next bitch, say her name is Texas (Texas)
She fly, but she wasn't the sexiest
She had a ho with her named 'Bama, short for Alabama
A big bad mama jama, now look here
I like big bitches ('Kay), 'cause they large (Uh-huh, uh)
And big bitches always take charge
Wanna grab a skinny nigga like Snoop Dogg
'Cause you like it tall, go and work it, baby doll (Baby doll)
Now a great big girl got a hell of a grip to grab a hold of
Got a lot of cash for a little love
All they wanna do is take you down to the mall
Floss a little bit and get a T-shirt that say, ""Ms. Snoop Dogg""
I don't see a goddamn thang
That's stoppin' you from buyin' me that goddamn ring
It'd look nice on my finger, I'ma buy you a zinger
'Cause you make me feel like a real hip hop singer
Your homegirl, bring her, 'cause I've been dyin' to meet her
You know I won't cheat her, don't mistreat her
She only get the dick, I'll never ever eat her
But I'll drop her ass, 'cause you know I don't need her
Shit, it was fun while it lasted
You know what they say, ""Big things come in small packages, baby"""
Eminem	15	Drug Ballad	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Verse 1]	"Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark (Fuckin' faggot)
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to mix Hen with Bacardi Dark
And when it kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl
And you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf
And my prediction is you're gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And everything's spinnin', you're beginnin' to think women
Are swimmin' in pink linen again in the sink, then in
A couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me outta this place, I'm outta place
I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	To the Listeners	Follow the Leader	1988	[Verse 1]	"It's to the listeners, for those that have a ear for this
State of the art, engineered for the mix
Eardrums are playin' along to what I'm sayin', you're singin' a song
Stevie Blass on the keyboard, swingin' along
But you don't have to dance, play it cool and listen
My DJ's mixin' and I'll do the quizzin'
'Cause who is number one? If not best, then better
Here's a hint, the eighteenth letter
The rhymes is sportable, microphone is portable
For any immortal man, swords is not affordable
Never take a loss 'cause I'm hard to beat
I ain't cheap, but don't sell me a dream, I don't sleep
I'm paid in full, so save the bull
This ain't a stick-up, you don't have to wave your tool
You feel sure, and you want more, then wipe your sweat
'Cause I just wanted to see how hype you could get
'Cause when I came in the door
Steppin' hard enough to shake the floor
I just started, but the others can't make no more
Runnin' out of beats, breaks and out of time
If I was gone, you'd be runnin' out of rhymes
I prove records don't have to be long
If it's understood and the story is strong
You could speak out and hold the crowd as prisoners
The people is peepless, it's to the listeners"
Dr. Dre	1	The Day the Niggaz Took Over	The Chronic	1992	[Verse 2]	"Sitting in my living room, calm and collected
Feeling that gotta-get-mine perspective
'Cause what I just heard broke me in half
And half the niggas I know, plus the niggas on the Row is bailing
Laugh now, but cry much later
You see, when niggas get together, they get mad 'cause they can't fade us
Like my niggas from South Central, Los Angeles
They found that they couldn't handle us
Bloods, Crips on the same squad
With the Ese's helpin', nigga, it's time to rob and mob
And break the white man off something lovely, biddy-bye-bye
I don't love dem so dem can't love me
Yo, straight puttin' it down, gettin' my scoot on
It's jumping off in Compton so I gots to get my loot on
And come up on me some furniture or somethin'
Got a VCR in the back of my car
That I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet
And motherfuckers better not try to stop me
'Cause they will see that I can't be stopped
'Cause I'ma cock my Glock and pop 'til they all drop"

I love to squabble, nigga, that's what I do
I'm always on detention, I ain't give a fuck
Mr. Lee can suck the ding-a-ling and jiggle the nut
I ain't the one, to let a nigga disrespect me
Or try to check me, get the wet T
Down with WC 'cause I'm a hood cat
Fuck a fine bitch but I prefer a hood rat
I love my Grey Goose, I like my blunts long
Don't get it fucked up, I come on wit' the come on
A hella cool dude, but rubbed the wrong way
I'm a dangerous nigga, say what the song say
I live it and breathe it, I shit it and eat it
I ain't never been defeated, punked out, retreated
I'mma low key, OG, from OZ's, to whole ki's
I ain't the one, duck and hide from the homeboy
Hit the neighborhood, let's get it on, boy
Let's throw a barbeque, or we can blow dank
If you don't smoke weed, then we can have dranks
'Cause y'all the homeboys, that kept the man fed
It's disrespectful not to come back and share it
So all you rappers hanging with you posses and clicks
Hit the streets and show your homies some love, they buying your shit"

Snub nose under that Pelle shit
I love New York, but gangbangin' that's L.A. shit
And I'm proud of it, spit it through the wire so the crowd love it
Haters you know who you are, you could turn it down, fuck it
I could shoot a video to it and spend half the budget
I'm gangsta, let the 40 cal' blow in public
More hatred inside my soul than 'Pac had for Delores Tucker
Every time one of my niggas get shot, the more I suffer
'Cause we trapped inside a world where you forced to die for your colors
I seen it all through the Range tints
Got niggas doin life in the state pen
So I dread like Jamaicans
If I die for one of my statements
Then break up the streets of Compton
Spread my blood in the pavement"

Fate tethered us together like two felons
Must've fell in love with skeletons
Everyone's got 'em, thought that you were Cinderella but (Yeah)
Feels like I slept with the (Uh) wicked stepmother
But how the hell am I
Still in love with the motherfucking chick there's at least a million of?
They say love the one you with
But this shit is killing us
Our love's on some other shit
I'm a glutton for punishment
You're the gloves, I'm the punching mitts
It's above and beyond us
Cuffing, I'm shoving the girl I love inside of an oven
If I catch you sucking another dick
You better unsuck it, you snuck in the crib and tried to jump under the covers again
Why am I tucking you in?
Probably 'cause"

My nickname the can, the slammer, the big house
I'm the place many fear 'cause there's no way out
I take the sun away put misery instead
When you with me most folks consider you dead
I saw too many inmates fallin' apart
Call for the guards to let them out at night when it's dark
Convicts think they alone but if they listen close
They can hear me groan touch the wall feel my pulse
All the pictures you put up is stuck to my skin
I hear ya prayers (even when ya whisperin')
I make it hotter in the summer, colder in the winter
If the court parole ya then another con enters
No remorse for your tears I seen 'em too often
When you cry I make you feel alive inside a coffin
Watch you when you eat play with you mind when you sleep
Make you dream that you free then you wake up to me
Face to face with a cage no matter your age
I can shatter you turn you into a savage in rage
Change ya life that's if you get a chance to get out
'Cause only you and I know what sufferings about
Yo it's stunnin' when bed sheets become your woman
And I'm the one that gotcha weapons when the beef is comin'
Maybe one day I'll open up my arms to release you
You'll always be my property nigga stay legal..."

With a throwback jersey and a fitted
Might blow a bag of Hershey in the siddix
Or might take sips of Army with a chiddick, I'm so sick with it
Lampin' in the Hamptons
The weekends, man, the Stan Smith Adidas and the Campus
Or playin' guts on the cruise, Hermès boat shoes
The Izod bucket on, I'm so old-school
Yellow wrist watch, Gucci flip flops
Six top model chicks, who is this hot?
J-A, ladies, help me say it now
Y-Z, mami, why you playin' with me?
Ride with me, get high as me
It's how it's supposed to be when you rollin' with G's, Hov

I had respect for you, lady
But now I take it all back
'Cause you gave me all your pussy
And you even licked my balls
Leave your number on the cabinet
And I promise, baby, I'll give you a call
Next time I'm feelin' kinda horny
You can come on over and I'll break you off
And if you can't fuck that day, baby
Just lay back and open your mouth

That I love in the whole wide world"
Big Boi	26	Decatur Psalm	ATLiens	1996	[Verse 2]	"Can you see what I be hearing talking to spirits when I sleep?
Peep this out real quick Slick, we gets on this beat and speak
About that pimp shit, that walk with dat limp shit, that hemp shit
Looking up in your face, I see a coward and a dimwit
Looking to run up in my private home just like you was the folks
Serving a warrant to a baby daddy who didn't come to court
On a Tuesday, April Fool's Day, don't get caught slipping
Leaving the keys off in the ignition, making me guilty by suspicion
Penny pinchers trying to stack for ninety-six
Buying another Fleetwood, Diamond took it, so now we's in the mix
I need to take my ass to the crib and drop the baby off
'Cause them niggas at the corner sto' been looking at me for too long
Staring like accidents on highways, high days are better than sober ones
Don't be biased, but I know it has to come (Uh)
So I put two in the sky to let them know I'm babysittin'
Y'all don't know nothin' 'bout Big Boi, 'cause that nigga steady dipping"
Kanye West	5	Big Brother	Graduation	2007	[Verse 2]	"Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
Nothing handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
'Round the same time of that Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'd bob his head and say ""Damn! Oh, that's you?""
But by The Black Album, I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like ""Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there"" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum"
Scarface	11	Hold It Down	The Resurrection	1996	[Verse 1]	"Gun shots rang out, niggas ducking, what the fuck?
Seen this nigga bite the bullet, it (Damn) fucked him up
Put him outside his innerself
Took his lifeline from him
Never got the chance to see who done it
Just niggas running, breaking to they shit
Befoe' the gun, put they ass up in the mix
And all I seen was him, laid out choking
Eyes to the back of his head, wide open
And I'm hoping that they don't find the killer
Because this nigga crossed a whole bunch of killers
But still a bunch of motherfuckas stand dazed
As they gaze at the corpse
Before they drop him in the grave "

Yeah player, so why hate it
My rhyme through out of control, when I say it
Spit back with a rap or a gat, can I spray it
How can I say it? I leave it de-hydrated
I take aim, and he keep the place flamin'
'Til the place cave in, aye yo this ain't a safe haven
Save the playin, stay blazin' with bass bangin'
The best is yet to come, so they stay in
They keep the music loud, the lights is low
The kid with a different style, I like to flow
It's time to move the crowd, tonight's the show
See what it's all about, they like to go
Get Henny and Mo and Cris
The clothes, the platinum, gold, the wrist
Plenty of doe, and chicks who pose for flicks
Women who love roll their hips, when I'm holding this"

What's going on in this house is staying here, comprende?
On my block, you had to have that understanding
'Cause if you told Ms. Mattie, she went and told Gladys
And once Punchy mama got it, it was all on the wire
And when the word got back, they set your ass on fire
On my block, we got some 'Nam vets, shellshocked
Who never quite got right; now, they inhale rocks
On my block, it's like the world don't exist
We stay confined to this small, little section we living in
Oh, my block, I wouldn't trade it for the world

Born and raised on my block"

And Red Alert was puttin' in work, with Chuck Chill
Had my homies on the hill gettin' ill, when shit was real
Went out to steal
Remember Raw, with Daddy Kane?
When De La Soul was puttin' Potholes in the game
I can't explain how it was, Whodini
Had me puffin' on that buddha gettin' buzzed, 'cause there I was
Them block parties in the projects and on my block

I expect retaliation in a hurry
I see death around the corner, any day
Tryin' to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
Strugglin' and strivin', my destiny's to die
Keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
In a ball of confusion, I'm thinkin' 'bout my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker, they never shoulda had me
I guess I seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
Got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
Am I paranoid? Tell me the truth

Ran out of indo, and my mind can't take the stress, I'm out of breath

I'm still the one that your parents hate
I'm in your house eating carrot cake
While I sit there and wait and I marinate
I’m irritated, you 'bout to meet a scary fate
And come home to find yourself starin' straight into a fuckin' barrel like Sharon Tate
Dre's on concerto while I narrate

What do it mean when you dream that you ballin'?
What do it mean when you never dream at all then
And you don't really know 'cause you can't recall them?
It's sorta fly you get a chance to say ""Hi"" to

Kendrick Lamar	16	Mother I Sober	Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers	2022	[Verse 2]	"I remember lookin' in the mirror knowin' I was gifted
Only child, me for seven years, everything for Christmas
Family ties, they accused my cousin, ""Did he touch you, Kendrick?""
Never lied, but no one believed me when I said ""He didn't""
Frozen moments, still holdin' on it, hard to trust myself
I started rhymin', copin' mechanisms to lift up myself
Talked to my lawyer, told me not to be so hard on myself
He has an aura, I hope to achieve, if I find some help
Congratulations, made it to be famous, still I feel uneasy
Water watchin', live my life in nature, only thing relieves me
Spirit guide whisper in my ear, tell me that she sees me
""Did he touch you?"" I said ""No"" again, still they didn't believe me
Mother's brother said he got revenge for my mother’s face
Black and blue, the image of my queen that I can't erase
'Til this day can't look her in the eyes, pain is takin' over
Blame myself, you never felt guilt 'til you felt it sober"
Nas	9	Undying Love	I Am...	1999	[Chorus]	"I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Did you believe in me?
I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Did you believe in me?"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Swimming Pools (Drank)	good kid, m.A.A.d city	2012	[Bridge]	"I ride, you ride, bang
One chopper, one hundred shots, bang

Lloyd Banks	34	Hate It or Love It (G-Unit Remix)	The Massacre	2005	[Chorus]	"Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P

Eminem	15	Same Song & Dance	Relapse	2009	[Chorus]	"Yeah, baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, ""Yeah, baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?"" Same song and dance"
Rakim	10	Stay a While	The 18th Letter	1997	[Verse 1]	"Just me and my peeps — we gettin' buzzed, lookin' for clubs
Missus with kisses and hugs, lookin' for love
She gotta be nice with hers, even with cookin' some grub
Once I'm in, I meet her friends then I'm hookin' my thugs
We'll be blowin' hundreds, always knowin' where the fun is
Roadrunners findin' more spots than Columbus
Pocket full of phone numbers from some of the world wonders
I take my time, and find where the right one is
Smooth as jazz but more than a half, ready for math
And on a steady path, like Betty Shabazz
And when I see the wiz, I'mma step to my biz
And there she is, let's see if she pass the quiz
It's appropriate we go get soakin' wet
Toast, we met, become close associates
The place is ours, by now I can embrace your style
So much flavor I can taste your smile, stay awhile"
Nas	9	Nastradamus	Nastradamus	1999	[Chorus]	"Nasty Nas, to Esco, to Escobar
Now he is Nastradamus

Eminem	15	If I Had	The Slim Shady LP	1997	[Chorus]	"But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics (If I had a million dollars)
If I had a magic wand
I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on while I'm on the john (I would set my troubles free)
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough 'cause I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks (If I had a million dollars)
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss"
Rakim	10	R.A.K.I.M.	8 Mile	2002	[Verse 2]	"Uh, yeah yo, I used to paint this flow, on ancient scrolls
And learn ta, make this dough, where gangstas roll
Think like the late great Capone when the bank is closed
It's cats that claim they bold, but they ain't this cold
I'm from New York City, even pretty chicks act up
Niggas get clapped up, you stack up, they stick that up
Put the strap up, you think my name was ""Kid back up""
Big niggas (spittin' noise) pick that up, or lift that up
Raised by gangstas and gamblers, hustlers, con artists
And convicts, killers and dons
Drug dealers, playas and pimps, smooth talkers
Stick up kids, thugs, real niggas and gods
Haunted by every soul that lay dead in the turf
Cursed by every spirit, that never made it to birth
Since the Moon separated from Earth
That's why they say I'm the greatest that ever orchestrated a verse
It's the"
Guru	20	Itz a Set Up	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 1]	"Though they conspire, fake us to make us retire
With the burning desire we make it out of the crossfire
Thoughts are higher, elevated and focused
While the path is narrow, for those like us
Primo's beats provoke us to meditate like Zen
With the will and the strength of a million men
While billions is spent, where nothing is meant
It's been that way for a while so much has come and then went
But I'm confident, a few, are due to redeem
Their respective kingdoms, with an abundance of cream
So if I were to scheme, it would be on a realer dream
Like formin' effective teams to filter the smokescreens
You totin' in jeans, don't even know the true enemy
A fan of Big and of Pac, and plus they both were friends to me
Past trivial pursuits like East and West coast feuds
Come against me on the mic, many and most will lose
Like most dudes, I love this hip-hop, and this rap stuff
But I don't like the shows where the ignorant act up
While some'll be rippin it, they be in the crowd wilin'
Flippin on kids, for the chains and medallions
Or the kid they don't like, from a beef from way back
And decide that's the night, perfect time for payback
It's wack for the group, plus the others who came
To see a phat-ass show, instead there's bullets aflame"
Big Pun	24	Super Lyrical	Capital Punishment	1998	[Verse 1]	"Ayo, my murderous rap verbal attack is actual fact
Tactical tracks match perfectly with graphical stats
Half of you lack the magical dap of tragical rap
That tackles your back and shackles and laughs at you
That's a mathematical madness I'm on
The savage, the strong
The marriage and bond of havoc and song
This massacre's on, as if Picasso laced you
There's lots of hateful skeletons locked
In the closet of my castle of Grayskull
I'm possum at grade school
That's why I have to debate you
My raps are like Cable, slashing your facial
That's how a master degrades you, I'm battling Jesus
If he passes through my label I'm snatching his halo
God, I'll trade you, if you send my father back as an angel
Language is fatal and it's hypnotizing
I'm only emphasizing
I'm still all about business and enterprising
I'm super lyrical, with brain-booster chemicals
That's used up tentacles inside of my mental projectable"
Lloyd Banks	34	Born Alone, Die Alone (Its OK)	Get Rich Or Die Tryin’ Music From And Inspired By The Motion Picture	2005	[Verse 2]	"Keep your circle official, watch the niggas that's wit'chu
Outsiders'll get you, hot shit in your tissue
All I need is my figures, I ain't stressin' no hoe
Ridin' 'round with my niggas, hand crushin' that 'dro
50 made me a star, now they know who we are
Out on top of the charts, your condo is my car
Income is my chain, stash box is my watch
I'm fairly new in the game, I ain't passin' the rock
All I'm sensin' is hate, ever since I been straight
'Cause they stuck in the hood, hand crumbs on they plate
And I'm strappin' the nine, in case they wanna combine
Gather up on a nigga, I ain't rappin' no line
Keep your eye on your money, stop eyeballin' mine
You drop somethin' every year, flop all of the time
Stop makin' your records, I ain't answerin' shit
Why don't you get off my dick"
OutKast	28	When I Look in Your Eyes	Idlewild	2006	[Bridge 3]	"Ooh, please come home with me
Ooh, don't you wanna marry me?
I'm even gonna rub your feet
When they stink

JAY-Z	6	All I Need	The Blueprint	2001	[Verse 3]	"The cream too long, my team too strong
Bleek is too hot, Beans is gone
Y'all niggas in the crosshair, the beams is on (See y'all)
Your whole block deserted, y'all fiends are gone (Bye-bye)
The whole Roc is jumpin', we reached our zenith
Got fiends throwin' up on themself like Willie Beamen (Haha)
Any given Sunday, gunplay's optional
However niggas want it like Soul II Soul (However do you want it?)
Whoever got hops get blocked, go to the hole
Dikembe Mutumbo of this rap shit
Plus the jab is sick, and it's Zab quick
Left hand'll lean 'em like a little past six
Now run along with your little-ass hits
Read my rap sheet, nigga, three classics
Shut your bumba', I got A-Rod numbers
All you muddaskunks get buried in the trunk
When I blast the pump, I leave you relaxed
In the hospital, lookin' at M*A*S*H for months
Then I dumps dough on the D.A. desk
And I flee scot-free and pee-pee on the steps
We's got no respect
No law or governin', why you fuckin' with him?
Matter fact, why you fuckin' with them?
All y'all need is the R-O-C, baby"
Eminem	15	Hello	Relapse	2009	[Verse 1]	"You see that chick in the gym, checking me out?
Any second I'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill and I'm recklessly wreckin' the house
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?
There's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man, I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Oh, jackpot, yeah—open sesame, mouth
Down the hatch, and the feeling—you can't match it
I rap-tap-tap on your door with a damn ratchet
Attack-tack-tacking a whore with a damn hatchet
A knapsack packed with like forty-some Xanaxes
Shorty, come back, I'm tryna score me some lapdances
I'm 'bout to relapse, so, baby, pour me some Jack Daniel's
Formula 44D and 40s with bad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch, I'm back at ya"
JAY-Z	6	Dirt Off Your Shoulder	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 3]	"Your boy back in the building; Brooklyn, we back on the map
Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest that run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em — niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album, then I back out it
As the best rapper alive — nigga, ask 'bout me
From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammys
From O's to opposite Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay for sellin' out the Garden in a day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'
I'm a hustler, homie; you a customer, crony
Got some dirt on my shoulder — could you brush it off for me?"
Eminem	15	Bitch Please 2	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Verse 4]	"Aw, naw! Big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls, dick six-inch long
Back up in the heezy, baby!
He's Shady! (Ha-ha-ha)
Give me the mic, let me recite 'til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal makin' a livin' off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right to say what I like
And walk around flippin' the bird?
Livin' the urban life like a white kid from the burbs
Dreamin' at night of screamin' at Mom, schemin' to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me, and people to see
That somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD usin' the fag word so freely
It's just me bein' me; here, want me to tone it down?
Suck my fuckin' dick, you faggot! You happy now?
Look here:
I start some trouble everywhere that I go
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know
I start some shit, they throw me out the back door
Come back and shoot the club up with a .44"
Kanye West	5	Heartless	808s & Heartbreak	2008	[Chorus]	"In the night, I hear 'em talk
The coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road
He lost his soul to a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?"
Jay-Z	12	Guess Who’s Back	The Fix	2002	[Verse 1]	"Guess who's bizzack?
You still smelling crack in my clothes
Don't make me have to relapse on these hoes
Take it back out to taxing them roads; when I was huggin' it
Niggas couldn't do none wit it, straight from the oven wit it
Came from the dirt
I emerged from it all without a stain on my shirt
You can blame my old earth
For the shit she instilled in me, still with me, pain plus work
Shit, she made me milk this game for all it's worth
That's right, these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm calling ""guts"" every time, drag my nuts every time, homie
We make a great combination, don't we?
Me and the Facemob, every time we face off
Face it, y'all—y'all niggas playin' basic-ball
I'm on the block like I'm eight feet tall (Woo!)
Homie, I'm in the drop with the A/C off
That's why the streets embrace me, dog, I'm so cool!"
Snoop Dogg	0	California Vacation	Doctor’s Advocate	2006	[Chorus]	"My heart beat for the West
We grow the best weed on the West
We lowride on the West
So I'ma die throwin' up the West

We grow the best weed on the West
Still lowridin' on the West
You should take a trip and visit the West"
Kanye West	5	Gold Digger	Late Registration	2005	[Verse 3]	"Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week, he moppin' floors, next week, it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gon' keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when he get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl"
Rakim	10	It’s Been a Long Time	The 18th Letter	1997	[Verse 3]	"When I flow tonight, I'll show 'em new heights I go to write
They know I strike with new prototypes to blow the mic
Critics and biters don't know where my source of light is
Still leave authors and writers with arthritis
Cursed kids like the pyramids when they found the style
First to ever let a rhyme flow down the Nile
The rebirth of hip-hop'll be dropped now
'Cause the crowd didn't hear the original in a while
So be alarmed, what you 'bout to see is the bomb
Like 3D in 'Nam, vivid like CD-ROM
Info kept like internet.com, my notebook's my bond like the Holy Quran
Since I came in the door, said it before
But, no, I ain't down with Eric B. no more
At night, the open mic be invitin' me to rhyme
So, yo, I'm online, it's been a long time"
Kurupt	4	New York, New York	Dogg Food	1995	[Verse 1]	"It's the incredible, the lyrical
You can't be me, like Niecy, to see me, it's gonna take a miracle
I'm drivin' muthafuckaz hysterical
Wit' a touch of this twister (Uh huh), stylistic mixture (Ahh)
What I create pulsates, there is no escape
Annihilate ya mental mind state
They labels my vocabulary abusive (Ahhh)
I packs more knowledge than Confucius
I'm deadly! (Ahh) Induce ya like Medusa, wit' thoughts to share
To niggas throughout this hemisphere, far and near (Ahh)
Prepare! Catch me chillin' like the winter
Up against the number one contender as I enter
'Cause I gets heated like friction
Muthafuck your whole jurisdiction
React this fact, not fiction telepathic addiction (Ahh)
To this homicidal recital, dangerous and vital to all my rivals
Suicidal brainwaves conveys
Through the average muthafuckaz' minds these days
I'm all ready to put work in
Take ten steps and turn to shoot the first nigga smirkin'
Give a FUCK whatcha name 
Whatcha claim , or why ya came
Muthafucka, don't explain! 
Simply, don't tempt me
'Cause I'm simply layin' hoes like SMPTE
 The invincible MC"
Big L	25	I Don’t Understand It	Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous	1995	[Verse 2]	"MC's — what's goin on?!
I don't understand, man, how rappers cold transform
One minute, you're hardcore and raw
That's what you was known for, but not no more
You changed, you rearranged, you're not the same
Your raps are plain, that explain why you lost your fame
Used to be on top, then you fell like rain drops
You turned pop, now you no longer gain props
Whose fault is that? Nobody's but your own, black
Used to make phat tracks, jack, but now you're stone wack
So MC's, don't ever step out your range
Remain the same, and only change with the time
Or else you'll get dropped like a dime
Go for yours like I'm goin' for mine
But if you're rough, stay rough!
If you're dap, stay dapper!
And never try to look or even sound like another rapper!
Just fulfill your own needs
Some rappers wore gold chains, and now they're wearin' beads?"
Snoop Dogg	0	Betta Days	No Limit Top Dogg	1999	[Verse 2]	"Better days ahead, Freddy's dead
And Betty said Eddie's a fed
Sweaty in bed with a nine to his head
And he fuckin with this hoodrat that he met up in dance
Betty gettin mad cause Eddie wanna share
But look at how you livin for a minute then compare
I love confetti, I always stay ready
Keep some killers by my side and some riders by the telli
I'm ready to do now, who now, you now
Eddie wasn't ready when they drew that, booyow
Two down, with just one gun
My nigga, and who said killin wasn't no fun
I sit alone in the zone with a face of stone
Live the life of Al Capone or Don Corleone
Tragically casualties and fatalities
And all kinds of funny ass niggas coming after me
My grand pappy once sat me on his lap and he said
Sonny get your money 'fore you end up dead
I never really understood what he said
Until my motherfucking dogg took a slug in his head
Cold way a nigga gotta learn his lesson
Slow down and go down, shit you know now"

And to them rudypoots don't attempt to try this at home
It's just a poem until y'all learn right from wrong
Know when to bless a situation, when to grab the chrome
But it's back on, another stormy night in Atlanta, Georgia
Overcast, but on behalf of OutKast, I cordially
Invite you to an emotion-filled theater
Bring your umbrellas, 'cause young fella it gets no weirder"

Havoc	7	Man Down	Hell On Earth	1996	[Verse 2]	"Infamous cartel, visible evidence
We scarred well, associated team benevolent
Never hesitant, opposition get settled, hit with
Sharp shit that'll rip through
One hundred layers of Kevlar
Sharp like the GemStar
Exiled, son, he get sent far
It's the foulest, QBC gat bust the loudest
But low profile, peep style, thirsty prowess
Catchin' court cases, paid lawyer, legal aid
Son, that's money wasted, I ain't got time for that
Invest, don't place all my bets on rap
On the strength of the ignorant cats
It'll be dead in a few, just like that
Could've bust his gat right (Yo, you know what?)
But now you bucked your own man, amateur ass
Homeroom, take that ass to class
But you cuttin', duckin' a reality blast
You catch a D-minus fuckin' with New York's finest
No conversation for them outsiders
Dick riders, connivers
Bomb your camp, leave no survivors
Caught you off guard, got homicided
We analyze and tell you up front, ain't no surprises
Take you down first round, give your man pound"
JAY-Z	6	Song Cry	The Blueprint	2002	[Verse 3]	"A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then?
You have given away without gettin' at me
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga livin' was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that
Shit, I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had just like that
I was just fuckin' them girls, I was gon' get right back
They say you can't turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
I'll mourn forever
Shit, I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever"
Rakim	10	Rest Assured	Don’t Sweat the Technique	1992	[Verse 1]	"I don't stress my day 'cause it's best to parlay
I guess you could say I've been away
I wake up slow when I'm hot but I destruct the plant
And fourteen hands comb New York for fans
They make waves as they wiggle in my waterbed
Pull back the leather covers and silk bedspread
A mornin' massage turnin into a real rough rubdown
So I figured I'll lay around
They keep me wet with a juice called Tahiti
It make the room steamy, so soon they couldn't see me
They know more than calisthenics as they worked up a sweat
It wasn't even ten o'clock yet
Scrub down, then I get moist, they never treat me mean
They sweetly keep me squeaky clean
I chill as they filled the jacuzzi
I said, ""I'm tight from a real long flight, could you soothe me
Support my thoughts, 'cause I got a lot of writing to do""
They said, ""Cool"" and just enjoyed the view
It ain't hard 'cause it's miles from the sidewalk
I'm overlookin' every borough in New York
The entire Empire State to concentrate
For every rhyme I make
So at exactly noon they played my favorite tune
And just before they all cleared the room
They said, ""We're glad you're home from tour, now we feel secure
We wish you didn't have to leave no more""
But they wanna go to war, they even tried to shoot up the door
""007 is back""
Rest assured"

To put on a pair of panties, much less a pair of jeans or the leotard
I got to start by complimenting you on your physique
You unique, you best believe I'm gon' skeet once I speak
Spoke, spit, spatter, spat and I macked her just like that
But it takes years of perseverance and experience to get the cat
So why don't I chase this Hennessy down with some of that?
On your back like a cheerleader missing the final stack
As we strut, skip the line
Through the glass window, glance, we look fine
Right on time as we step in the place
The nursery's crunk, we've come to play"
Travis Scott	33	LOOOVE	UTOPIA	2023	[Chorus]	"They love me, love me, love me, yeah, they love me long time

Mad at me cuz I'm makin shit them thug's feelin

Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
'Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door, she get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race, who could get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinkin' 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
On my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gon' sip 'til every bubble in every bottle is gone"

But it ain't the role, the gear, or the money, the
Swift intellectionist with plenty of
Bite, if it's dark, I'll spark every one of ya
I throw a mic in the crowd, if it's questioned
I got the answer, it includes directions
Go manufacture a match, show me after
A blast of a master that has to make musical massacre
Attack your rap 'til it's handicapped
You'll never hold the mic again, try to hand it back
For every rapper that comes, I cut off his thumbs
Put a record to his neck, if he swallows, it hums
Slice from ear-to-ear, so he can hear better
Before he bleed to death, hear, hear every letter
And you can see how quick and thick the blood can get
If you try to change the style or the subject
As I get deep in the rhyme, I'm becomin' a
MC murderer, before I'm done, I'mma
Prepare the chamber, the torture's comin' up
Trip through the mind, at the end you'll find it's The Punisher!
Kill 'em again!"

Eminem	15	Same Song & Dance	Relapse	2009	[Verse 1]	"I'm lookin' at ya, yeah, girl, you're kinda tooken back by
The whole rapper thing, aren't ya?
Probably thinking you'll get slapped so dang hard, ya
Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?
Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster
The police constantly bugging you non-stop
I walk up on ya, “Well, hello, Tonya
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck
You out of gas? Do you got a flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
I got your back, why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back
And sit up front? I'm not asking, it's a trap
You just got jacked and body snatched, and it's a wrap
In broad day, and no mask for this attack
I heard 'em say, 'Exact opposites attract'
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get you back, come on"""

One wall, twenty plaques, dues paid, gimme that
I am limelight, Blueprint, five mics
Go-Getters rhyme like should've been signed twice
Most imitated, Grammy nominated
Hotel accommodated, cheerleader prom-dated
Barbershop player-hated, mom-and-pop bootlegged it
Felt like it rained 'til the roof caved in
Two words: Chi-Town raised me, crazy
So I live by two words: ""Fuck you, pay me""
Screaming, ""Jesus, save me""
You know how the game be, I can't let 'em change me
'Cause on judgment day, you gon' blame me
Look, God—it's the same me

I didn't know he smoked, so I didn't watch him close
He caught me on the sneak tip, now the punk's in deep shit
Catch him on the streets, I'ma bring him to his feet quick
Pass the clip, I think I see him comin' now
Fuck the bullshit, posse deep and let's run him down
Gots to be the first one to hit ya when we meet
Comin' quickly up the streets is the punk-ass police
The first one jumped out and said, ""Freeze""
I popped him in his knees and shot him, punk, please
’Cause cops should mind they business when we rush
Now you're bleedin' like a bitch 'cause you don't know how to hush
Now back to the smoker that robbed me
I tell you like Latifah, motherfucker, give me body
One to the chest, another to his fuckin' dome
Now the shit can rest, yo, tell him to leave me the fuck alone
Two very bloody bodies on the streets
A nosy-ass cop and a nigga that robbed from me

In my state because the country
Every part of it is part of me

And you know that we down

Do you see what's the C.O. see?
Robocop opt to his C-O-P
Three hots and a C-O-T
Lived in a small town, his whole life
Never left like soundin' like the hole, right?
Either working at the prison, or it's no lights
In the system working with the police
In the prison stripping niggas phone rights
Got a malice, on the other side of the bars
Watching niggas get smart, watching niggas get strong
Watching niggas get home, he jail us
But deep down he jealous
With each sweep down, he tell us
With each beatdown, he help us
Wrong one gon' knock his ass out though
It's why he gotta lock all the niggas out for
Warden told the boy he better calm down
Step back from the brink and put the bomb down
But how the whole world in your palm sound?
It's why they treat niggas like shit
Writing raps to the taps
Keep the face mask on 'em, these niggas might spit"

Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen, I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block
'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
(Hey Ma', Ma'!)
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press
I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (Yes)
Grew up quick (No), was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say's right
You think of my name now whenever you say, ""Hi""
Became a commodity 'cause I'm W-H-I-
T-E, 'cause MTV was so friendly to me
Can't wait 'til Kim sees me

Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now"

With a bunch of souvenirs and a smile for your mouth
I really missed you, each and every night I kissed you
In my dreams 'fore I went to sleep
To la-la land to count them sheep
I swear you're looking prettier than ever
It's got to be a prophecy for us to stay together, evermore
For better or, less or poor
Or worth our weight in buried treasure, X's on the shore
I know my world tour's like war to you
But Ian said, ""Aloha"", and Harley said, ""Cheers""
Julian said, ""Bonjour"", Big O was like, ""Yeah!""
Amanda and Le Messie want to know when we going there
Edison sends his love, so does the rest of the club
Of the international playboys and playgirls
But I revoke my membership, all for My Tenderness
She said, ""Pursue your interests 'cause even if I'm ticketless
I'll be there, by your side
In your heart, and on your mind""

I gotcha, who loves you bae
Now bring it back now"

And then you die but for now, life, close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers, had nothing to live for like them lifers but
Making sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price to circle us, success, they turned my mic up
I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with some shit that'll light your life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall 'cause everyone will be each others crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen, I drop jewels, bust it

Reminiscing when it wasn't all business

So we all gather here for the dearly departed
Hip-hopper since a toddler
One homeboy became a man, then a mobster
If it dies, let me get my last swig of vodka
RIP, we'll donate your lungs to a rasta
Went from turntables to MP3's
From ""Beat Street"" to commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts
I'm looking over my shoulder
It's about 80 people from my hood that showed up
And they came to show love
Sold out concert and the doors are closed shut"

And Firm Fiascoes—assholes
Fucked you up with my last video, tuxed up doing a tango
And cash, always in my grasp
Came up in the game wearin' khakis not kangols, stranglin' hoes
When asked about it in most interviews I just laugh
Now I vacate with hoes with a gang of ass
One feedin' me mangoes, the other lightin' my hash
Rap tabloids write Dre's light in the ass (What?)
Came home uptight, ready to mash
Like a gas pedal, get on that '64 Chevy level
AK-47 heavy metal
Who say Dre ain't ghetto? Just whistle like a tea kettle
I throw three at you, tell me if you see devils
'Cause we rebels over here, I smell chronic in the air
That means we takin' over this year, you hear?"

And all you niggas pussy, need Massengil
See I'm the gun-cocker, one-shotter, lift 'em off the ground
Chop 'em down, like a cantaloupe, My flow the antidote
Sick flow, it's so, motherfuckin six-fo'

As I daze about the past, and them days in the past
He set my mind free, so my mind free at last
So much that I don't even drink from a fuckin' glass
I'd rather find the first fountain I can and do it fast
Didn't understand the dream of a King, I do the math
Coincidentally on your birthdays, I ditched the class
Cause the younger me, dumber me was chasin' the cash
Chasin' the ass, lowlife with his face in the grass
Ridin' home from school, in front of the bus
Not even thinkin' 'bout how Rosa Parks done it for us
How she stayed behind bars and she done it for us
And she stayed behind bars 'til she won it for us
Sometimes I wanna give up or at least take a break
That's when I close my eyes and see Coretta Scott's face

And once my smoke hit ya throat
You know I gotcha

Pimp pimp parade, my nigga get your bang on

Shoulda heard my my nigga Mack 10 on the chirp
All I need is me and my bitch, if you scared go to church
Cause in Califorinia, niggas crack heads for the turf
And life ain't nothin but TEC-9's and dirt
Dippin through the the jungles, my escalade hit a dip
Fuck! Here come the gorillas in the mist
And they dressed like Ice Cube was in 96
Stone cold jheri curls and not one drip

And I hope I'm forgiven for thug livin' when I die
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto for thug niggas
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a playa
Overdose of a dick while drinking liquor when I lay her
Pistol whippin' these simps for being petrified and lame
Disrespecting the game, praying for punishment and pain
Going insane, never die, I live eternal, who shall I fear?
Don't shed a tear for me, nigga, I ain't happy here

And my nigga Game light another L, pass the bottle
Pro-black I don't pick cotton out a aspirin bottle
Yeah I learned my lessons and heard y'all snitchin'
Witnessin' you rockin wit' narcs confirmed my suspicion
Green fatigues on, my niggas I'll bleed for 'em
I can show 'em the water but can't make 'em drink it

Maybe because I'm busy and she need someone to spoil her
It gets annoying, from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know that we friends and nutting more
She loves it when I'm in town, hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear her down, next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hitting the ground, just enough to hold us down
I'm sticking and moving, cruising after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a forty-year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with her frame
And to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name
Her panties wet over fame, fell in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer, would she remain?
Surrounding me, hounding me, trying to be my ON-LY

The line for the microphone is departed
So leave it up to me, my DJ is mixing
Everyone is moving, but eager to listen
Your hands in the air, your mouth is shut
'Cause I'm on the mic and Eric B is on the cut
For those that know me, indeed I like to flow
Especially when the music's going slow
It gives me a chance to let everybody know
It's time to bust out the Rakim show
I'm the intelligent, wise on the mic, I will rise
Right in front of your eyes 'cause I am a surprise
So I'ma let my knowledge be born to a perfection
All praise is due to Allah and that's a blessing
With knowledge of self, there's nothing I can't solve
At 360 degrees I revolve

I'll whip your head, boy, with the back of the steel

2Pac	18	Toss It Up	The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory	1996	[Verse 4]	"How do you want it? What's your phone number? I get around
Cali Love to my true Thugs, picture me now
Still down for that Death Row sound, searchin' for paydays
No longer Dre Day
Arrivederci, blown and forgotten, rotten for plottin' child's play
Check your sexuality, as fruity as this Alizé
Quick to jump ship, punk trick, what a dumb move
Cross Death Row, now who you gon' run to?
Laugh at you suckers 'cause you similar
Pretending to be hard, oh my God, check your temperature
Screaming ""Compton"", but you can't return, you ain't heard?
Brothers pissed 'cause you switched and escaped to the burbs
Mob on to this new era, 'cause we untouchable
Still can't believe that you got Pac rushing you
Up in you, bless the real, all the rest get killed
Who can you trust? Only time reveals
Toss it up"
Snoop Dogg	0	New York, New York	Dogg Food	1995	[Chorus]	"New York, New York, big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems

Snoop Dogg	0	In Love with a Thug	No Limit Top Dogg	1999	[Verse 1]	"Yeah, gangsta, uh-huh!
Have you ever had a pretty, young saditty
Black female with chips, from the city?
Her momma got ends, and her daddy got ends
And she liked to give me ends when I'm out with my friends
Good girl - why do good girls like bad boys? (I don't know)
When I was a kid, growin up, I never had toys
And I think that she can figure that shit out (why?)
Cause every time she came to pick a nigga up
Shit, she'd take a nigga out
Roll around town, ask the pound, they know, look
Baby was my thang, nah, she was my low-low
Bought my first Rol-o, and then we took a photo together
Man I hope this thang last forever
We been together six months, and we ain't argued yet
She lovin a nigga, steady buyin me shit
And don't say shit when I dip with my click
And understand, when I'm down and out
May need some help with some chips
Her mother approved of me, but her father he don't
He probably won't, shit Pops ain't no punk
Daddy's little girl be in a gangsta's world
Buyin me houseshoes and khaki blues, California curls
No matter what her father say, baby gon' see me
It's like a jungle sometimes, that makes me Wonder like Stevie
Believe me, when I say that baby was in love with a thug
In love with a thug"

You wanna know how much the whole package go for?
My spectacle, like a festival
It's majestical, special guest for you
Ready to party hard, the party's in yards to the mardi gras
Rap seance, please give you a body massage
Rock jams, have you hot in your pants and nasty
Forbidden dance with me or tickle your fancy?
Let Ra take you on a rendezvous
Couple of days will do if it's okay with you
Deserted isle style, middle of winter with no bed
I'll comfort you like you were Jennifer Lopez
You get what you deserve if I said we swerve
I'll hit more than nerve and that's my every word
Baby, bounce"

Here, take a cab, thanks a lot for the cock
She's gone and I'm thinkin' that my game's so strong
Pat myself on the back and move on
Is this just how it is? Hell no
'Cause she came back with the kid, and yo
I been payin' ever since
The clothes, the food, the cars and, oh, the rent
All of my time gets spent at the workplace
No time to kiss her got me this in the first place
So, I do the dishes and clean the floor
When I sleep I can't dream no more
Oh no, now I'm a part time mutha
And I change the diapers and clean the shit
The tables are turned, I can't take this
Oh no, now I'm a part time mutha"

Eminem	15	The Real Slim Shady	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Verse 3]	"I'm like a head trip to listen to
'Cause I'm only givin' you things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (Err), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder, ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings (Ch, puh)
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be out of your mind and out of control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?"
Havoc	7	Clap	Infamy	2001	[Verse 3]	"Degree in drama knowledge, you niggas just pay the homage
You niggas should be abolished for that rappin ass garbage
To me, you just a target, easy to hit
With that loud barkin Stevie Wonder couldn't even miss
Then it's 1, 2, 3, baby boy you gettin hit
And ripped, like a whole bitch, by the vultures
Rusty ass gems niggas already know this
Kill who you run with, in charge off who you die with
Prada'd up, Gucci'd up, died on some fly shit
Regulate a wig split a little nigga big nigga
Any nigga kill you your man it be da pen shitta
So fuck niggas they ain't on my level cos I been did it
Talk about cliques most infamous run with it
Catch a body syndrome, dawg my niggas sick with it
And clap a nigga in the first degree"
Havoc	7	Bloodsport	Hell On Earth	1996	[Verse 1]	"I kick that progress and to that dumb nigga, God bless
I know you can't sleep or rest behind that bullshit
Now you rock a vest, scared to death while you walkin'
Fuck the talkin', we straight up New Yorkin'
We blowin' niggas, heart attack strokin' niggas
Provokin' niggas, shittin' all over niggas
You rollin' thick, but yo, the Mobb rollin' thicker
Get that liquor, turn your back, icepick ya
But fuck that, stickin' with the gat is quicker
Scared to come around my corner, you ass, nigga
Do it your way all day, fake shit
What you gonna do outta town, play bitch?
And run like a faggot, switch, take the whole shit
And show the world, don't sweat it, babygirl
I gotta hem and pull the gat like a stem
You all fucked up like an offbeat blend
I send messages that you couldn't read clear
Try to play the front, but got stuck in the rear
Take it as a letter, but I'm not sincere"
MC Ren	17	Niggaz 4 Life	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Verse 1]	"Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Well it's because motherfuckers wanna blast me
And run me outta my neighborhood
And label me as a dope dealer yo, and say that I'm no good
But I gave out jobs so niggas wouldn't have to go out
Gave em some dope and a corner so they could show out
When the cops came, they gave a fake name
Because the life in the streets is just a head game
So therefore, to make more
A 15-year-old black kid'll go and rob a liquor store
And get shot in the process
He ate up a nine bullet and now he's put to rest"

Snoop Dogg	0	One Shot One Kill	Compton	2015	[Verse 1]	"Guess who's back, it ain't a fuckin' question
They know the name, bow in the presence of a living legend
Fuck what you heard, it's murda murda, you gon need protection
Some niggas blinded, couldn't see
So look for me to come and give direction
Who hold the crown, it ain't no conversation
I’m being modest should be silent 'less you payin' homage
Remain the hottest, niggas can't stop us, that's just being honest
And makin' hits, I never had problems much in that department
Don't get me started, don't compare me to the newest nigga (oh-oh no!)
For every one of you, there's a hundred more
And I watch them come and go, my track record ain't coincidental
And these verses is like hearses
Consistently killin' y'all with instrumentals
Tell me, fuck what would y'all do without me?!
Kill yourself for even thinking something crazy 'bout me
I'm like Ali, your fuckin' champ, now watch me rope a dope
Just watch him choke, cause everythin' I drop is dope
Now watch 'em all go up in smoke"
2Pac	18	Dear Mama	Me Against The World	1995	[Verse 2]	"Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated"
Scarface	11	Mind Playin’ Tricks ’94	The Diary	1994	[Verse 2]	"Dear diary I'm havin' a little problem with my mind state
How many bullets would it take to change my mind? Wait
Sometimes I want to end it but I don't though
They tell me see my pastor but I don't go
'Cause they all be on this one street
So I take it on myself to thank him one deep
And give my money to the most needy, uh
And never put it in the hands of the most greedy
Cause their puttin' a price tag on a man's word
And it's a fashion show, so the men flirt
The world is endin' so they try to make us switch fast
And they openin' up these churches for some quick cash
And usin' the money fo' they new cribs
While Brother Johnson just got kicked out where he lived
I follow no man, 'cause man be phoney"
Lloyd Banks	34	Gangsta Shit	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Verse 3]	"Come on, nigga
I ain't here to make no friends, just cut the cheques
I got a long pump that'll blow your stupid ass up the steps
Begging niggas don't understand, no
Probably cause my hand glow when I'm anticipating' the Lambo
Lean out my bucket for niggas thinking they Rambo
You get one warning, so I suggest you let your man know
These rap niggas portray to be tough, nobody acting soft
Til they laid out in the hospital, eating apple sauce
Usually for yapping off and turn apologetic
Waving a white flag, for danger they might have
My niggas buying so much ammo
If you reach in the couch for loose change
You'll probably feel on a handle
Holding sixteens to get your bandages and broke bones
So I suggest you get alarm systems in both homes
There's only one team on top; we number one with a Glock
Don't fuck around and get your dumb ass SHOT!"
Eminem	15	Rock Bottom	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Chorus]	"That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear"

My son three now
And I've been watchin' Dre so long, I'm makin' beats now
Game on the rebound like Ben Wallace in the D-Town
I mean Chi-Town, fuck it, it can go down
Nigga I'll spit the whole round, fo' plus fo' pounds
Nigga this the wild wild West, call it a showdown
And I'm Billy the Kid 'til they split my wig
I come back from the dead, tell 'em kill me again
Put my head on a barrel, dare a nigga to shoot me
I'm gangsta, took more shots than Tookie
I'm alive so I'ma take a Patron shot for Tookie
Roll a California blunt and keep watchin' a movie
Inspired by this gangbangin' shit since I was two
I brought the West Coast back, what the fuck you do?
I'm the ice cream truck man, guns in the trunk man
Drugs in the trunk man, call me the front man"
Jay-Z	12	Paper Chase	Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life	1998	[Verse 3]	"Yo, yeah, I got that stress and I got it the best
I ain't got it to give, but I got it to test
And if you wanna get down, all you gotta invest
Is your time, I gotta move this in a week or less
For the next couple of days I brought out all I possess
The Rolex, necklaces with the VVS
Between the driver and the passenger where the TV rest
For my top draft picks I cop the new GS
Now all the little soldiers wanna roll with my team
Cause I ain't sold em a dream, I just showed 'em the cream
Picked em up in the afternoons and told 'em some things
You know the regular shit you do when you molding them teens
Yo, never lay your head where you holding them things
Keep the family then your business, nothing goes in between
Never feared no man, put four in his bean
Drop your gun then, blow the scene, ya heard me?"
50 Cent	19	I’m So Hood	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Verse 1]	"Lil' Tyrone tired of gettin' his ass whipped, so he holdin' that gat down

Bobby was a fuckin' bum, he pumpin' packs now
He need some fresh chicks, white tees and fitted hats now
Uncle Rock a wino, he won't put the 'gnac down
Eric had the jump shot, but he's smokin' crack now
The Lunatics, the Lost Boyz, Cheeks shit is whack now
Country blew trial, them crackers got him on his back now
And Sean {*ka-click*} runnin' round with his fuckin' gat now
Up in niggas cribs, sayin' ""where that money at pal?""
Now Sandra from BK I seen her out in Houston
That bitch traveled the world, she runnin' round boostin'
Now Toya got these bad-ass kids, they a nuisance
Her baby daddies never come around, they useless
Every now and then I come through on some new shit
Pearly white 6 or some chrome deuce-deuces"
Dr. Dre	1	Bitch Niggaz	2001	1999	[Verse 2]	"Straight off the streets of chaos and no pity
The aggravated, makin' these punk motherfuckers hate it

Can't never leave the crib without a murder wea-pon
Huh, I can't live my life on broke no mo'
And most of these fools ain't shit but cutthroats
They smile in a nigga face, and for what?

The Game	13	Too Much	Doctor’s Advocate	2006	[Verse 1]	"I'm from the old hood, somethin' like yo' hood
Where niggas don't know good or know Suge, but the blow good

Send it to Houston in a gray Mercedes
I'm a product of my environment, grew up in the 80s
So that mean, me, Kanyeezy and Young Jeezy all crack babies
And it's evident my flow is heaven-sent
First LP, on the same shelf as the veterans
Nigga I can't be fucked, like a lesbian
I'm to hip-hop what Cartoon is to Mexicans
I'm an artist, never claimed to be the hardest
Just number one since B.I.G. and Pac departed
Nate ridin' with me, Snoop ridin' with me
All you other niggas used to be good like Ken Griffey
I'm on fire like the tip of a blunt
On fire like a nigga that let it drip for a month
I'm a Blood, you can Crip if you want, just let it bump
Like you got Scott Storch tied up in the trunk
I'm the ice cream truck man, guns in the trunk man
Drugs in the trunk man, call me the front man"
Kendrick Lamar	16	No More Parties in LA	The Life of Pablo	2016	[Verse 1]	"It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van""
Um—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl in North Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said, ""Baby, spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards""
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, ""K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy"""

'Member we earthlings, nigga, can you put that in slow-mo?
Hope so, headshots
Brains in a pan, so that's a no-no
Might not get it, but it's dope though, matter fact, loco
Surrounded by gang members and a lot of po-po
That's real but it might sound like a joke though
Never know, keep both sides in a chokehold
I just wanted credit, used to sweat it like show clothes
Now I don't even know who wrote those
Maybe my ghost knows (Boo) but we both cold
I done used to write all my ghost flows, wrote each other solos (Boo)
Now the nigga say he want co-pros
Money from the shelves and rights to the logo (Boo, boo)
""Do you want a lawyer?"" No, ho"

It's Snoop Dogg, I'm on the mic, I'm back with Dr. Dre
But this time I'ma hit yo' ass with a touch
To leave motherfuckers in a daze, fucked up
So sit back, relax, new jacks get smacked
It's Snoop Doggy Dogg, I'm at the top of the stack
I don't lack for a second, and I'm still checkin'
The dopest motherfucker that ya hearin' on the record

And I'm high 'til I dizzie, rizzide
So check it, I get busy, I make your head dizzy
I blow up your mouth like I was Dizzy Gillespie
I'm crazy, you can't phase me
I'm the S oh yes, I'm fresh, I don't fuck with the stress
I'm all about the chronic, bionic ya see
Every single day, chillin' with the D-O-double-G's
P-O-U-N-D that's my clique, my crew
You fuck with us, we gots to fuck you up

Nas	9	Family	Nastradamus	1999	[Verse 2]	"Ayo, I drink to that
I'm like a dictionary, y'all rappers exam me
You violate, they read your obituary in front your family
You should idolize Nas in the flesh
Don't wait 'til I'm dead, to say I was the best, no doubt
We shot hoops with coat hangers, got loot with dope slangers
Sold soap to strangers, joked with danger
Rob prostitutes, dodge cops in hot pursuit
Bought weight from rastas, travel hot routes
O.T. commute back and forth
Tell shorty get that package off
Fuck being trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit
Caught a case then I beat the shit
D's on the block flash badges, nylon jackets
Big white boys with guns yelling, ""Freeze black kids!""
Got my niggas in the pen, eating octopus
Wishing they was on the blocks with us
To watch me and P do it (uh), put the heat to it (uh)
Put it out, first day, the whole street knew it
Bitches, hold they pussies and bop to the music
And think deep to it, now who the truest?"
Kanye West	5	Big Brother	Graduation	2007	[Verse 1]	"It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout

J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
That he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, ""He could change your life
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig""

Eric B. & Rakim	14	The Punisher	Don’t Sweat the Technique	1992	[Verse 3]	"Dangerous rhymes performed like surgery
Cuts so deep, you'll be bleedin' burgundy
My intellect wrecks and disconnects your cerebral cortex
Your cerebellum is next!
Your conscience becomes sub-conscious
Soon, your response is nonsense
The last words are blurred, mumbled then slurred
Then your verbs are no longer heard
You get your lung fried so quick you're tongue-tied
He couldn't swing or hang, so he hung 'till he died
Reincarnate him and kill him again
Again and again, again and again
I leave him in the mausoleum so you can see him
I got a dead-emceein' museum
When I create 'em, I cremate 'em and complicate 'em
You can't save 'em, there's no ultimatum
Mics lay around full of ashes, with the victim's name in slashes
Got a long list and I'mma get every one of ya!
Beware of The Punisher!
Then I'ma kill 'em again!
Wake 'em up... kill 'em again!"
Big Boi	26	Church	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse 2]	"Life is nothing but a dream, so peaceful and serene
Unless you're being evil then you on the devil's team
Wide receive what you want to believe
But soon you'll have to sow those bad seeds
Please, any man can ask to get a pass
Or a cleansing of sin to grant another chance
Perhaps another glance of the light at the end of the tunnel
Talk to the coach or break out the huddle
Whatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle
Because he who lives in the upper room is never gullible
As you survey the syllables and sentences, the question
That I'm merely trying to pose is as simply as me saying"

Screamin' out the next nigga's name like a bitch
And the niggas that I ran into recently
The motherfuckers at the club that pulled the piece on me
You little bitches shoulda pulled the fuckin' trigger
Now you live in fear of a heartless-ass nigga

But like Terminator, nigga, I'll be back
Yeah, and I'll be back with a fuckin' army
You tried to harm me, ring the alarm, G

With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up

Eight months, 13 days before I knew a Mike Len
And three years after Mason Betha turned his mic in
I started writin' 22 months and 20 weeks prior
To LeBron shakin' Adidas for Nikes
I'm right here, six years after Randy Moss

Where was the money that you said you would send me?
Talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Asking 'bout school and my welfare
But it's clear, you ain't sincere, hey, who the hell cares?
You think I'm blind, but this time I see you comin', Jack!
You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin' back
Asking 'bout my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
So don't even start with that ""Wanna be a father"" shit
Don't even bother with your dollars, I don't need it

Kanye West	5	Blame Game	My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy	2010	[Interlude]	"Things used to be, now they not
Anything but us is who we are
Disguising ourselves as secret lovers
We've become public enemies
We walk away like strangers in the street
Gone for eternity
We erased one another
So far from where we came
With so much of everything
How do we leave with nothing?
Lack of visual empathy equates the meaning of L-O-V-E
Hatred and attitude tear us entirely

Snoop Dogg	0	Snoopafella	No Limit Top Dogg	1999	[Verse 1]	"Once upon a time, in the L.B.C
On the Eastside, off of 2-1 Street
There lived a young man, Cinderfella's his name
To make it interesting it's me, peep game
I lived in a house with my cruel step-dad
And two step-brothers who treated me bad
I cooked, I cleaned, I scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy runnin to the stores
My brothers, they used to boast and brag:
""We've got Fubu, and you've got rags!""
And even worse than that, to make me feel low
They gave me a skateboard, while they had low-lows
Girls used to say, ""Snoop, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with that to' up khaki suit""
Welllll, one day, up the Avenue
There was a man, surrounded by the Dogg Pound crew
He said ah, ""Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the sweet princess""
Well I, um, ran home when I heard the newsflash
I bust through the door, straight to my step-dad
I said, ""Step-dad, may I?""
And before I could finish, ""Hell no!"", he replied (Cinderfella!)
My brothers were goin, they were gettin down
Even Pops was goin for a piece of the crown (Cinderfella!)
They flaunted, they haunted, they knew what I wanted
""We can and you can't,"" is what they taunted (nana-nana-nah-nah)
They all stood there, laughin in my face
And as they walked out they said, ""Clean up this place!"""

It's where I find my heaven, and where you find your hell at
You're in my clutches now, you get slit up and lit up
Just like some Dutches now, see I'm hard to define
My mind travels far, from ghettoes to galaxies
Representin' Gang Starr -- The street life
The reason why my mic ignites, I bring more ruckus
Than a nightclub fight, or bar brawl
I'm swingin' lyrics like broken glass palm to skull y'all

Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still, nobody want a nigga having shit!
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I'd push a Q45 Infinit'

False imprisonment, Huey P, Geronimo Pratt
Now close your eyes, listen to me, your mind'll go back
Picture us chained together under the boat, that's a Kodak
And since today is Thursday, let me hit you with a throwback
Stolen identities, God left us here without LoJack
Forced to find ourselves, forced to break up outta chains
Got tired of getting hanged so we started our own gangs
Tookie Williams (Crip), Sylvester Scott (Blood)
Seventy two Lil' Country caught a slug
And that was the first time a crip ever killed a blood
Now the shit is worldwide cause it is what it was
We know the history and we know the shit could end any day"

Gang Starr	21	Code of the Streets	Hard to Earn	1994	[Verse 1]	"Take this for example, young brothers want rep
'Cause in the life they're living, you can't half step
It starts with the young ones doing crimes for fun
And if you ain't down, you'll get played out, son
So let's get a car, you know, a fly whip
Get a dent puller, screwdriver and be off quick
With a dope ride, yeah, and a rowdy crew
We can bag us a Benz and an Audi, too
Even a jeep or a van, goddamn, we're getting ours, yo
Take a trip up the strip and be like stars, so
It doesn't matter if the cops be scoping
They can't do jack, that's why a young brother's open
To do anything, anywhere, anyplace
Buck wild in another court case
It's the code of the streets"

I'm in the stars drivin' myself, I feel like autopilot
Designer Goyard bucket, I'm my own stylist

Had to go Draco, Draco, Draco, all I could do about it
Soon as it come my way, I can't do nothin' but see about it"

I might hit the club, find a chick that's tailor-made
For me, say fuck it, kick some shots back, get hammered, and nail her
These bitches tryin' to get attached, but they're failin' to latch onto the tail of
My bumper, they're scratchin' at the back of my trailer
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched, yeah, I'm rich as a bitch
But bitches ain't shit, I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch, you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me: that's what I call pitchin' a bitch
That's why I'm swingin' at this chicks on-site
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul, but my dick's on strike
So all that love shit is null and void, bitch, I'm a droid
I avoid Cupid, stupid! Wasn't for blow jobs, you'd be unemployed
Oye-yoy-yoy, man-oh-man, your boy-boy-boys
Gettin' sick of these girls-girls-girls, oink-oink-oink
You fuckin' pigs, all you're good for is doink-doink-doink
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of 'em, I need a machine gun
I'll take 'em all out, I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest, have a heart attack and just
Drop dead, and I'ma throw a fuckin' party after this, 'cause yes"

Spend it all on a forty-ounce to the neck
And in retrospect, I remember December being the hottest
Squad cars, neighborhood wars, and stolen Mazdas
I tell you motherfuckers that life is full of hydraulics
Up and down, get a six-four, better know how to drive it
I'm drivin' on E with no license or registration
Heart racin', racin' past Johnny because he's racist
1987, the children of Ronald Reagan
Rake the leaves off your front porch with a machine blowtorch (I'm really out here, my nigga)
He blowin' on stress, hopin' to ease the stress (Like, really out here)
He coppin' some blow, hopin' that it can stretch

Hoppin' out the passenger with calendars 'cause your day comin'
Run him down and then he gun him down, I'm hopin' that you fast enough
Even the legs of Michael Johnson don't mean nothin', because"

Goons left, goons right, coupe with blue lights
Bad girls in black pearls, gave us cat calls
Took 'em back to the crib to break they ass off
In the loft, mixing hash and dro
Honey spreaded that asshole like a wide mouth bass
Sippin' wine out the glass, Teddy Pendergrass blast
When the phone ring, the house lights flash
Turned down the sound, let's get down to business
Shit about to go down with some foul niggas
What the voice said, ""What up, pop? Who want it?""
I put the guap up, get the boy popped
He say ""Son, stop, it's dudes you feedin'
Who feedin' other dudes, but they really not eatin'""
Dog, why you callin' me? This our food
You handle the mouths that it trickles down to
Niggas want beef, I want some of that cow too
But I'm in my princely robe, simply rich
Don't bother me with silly shit, call Rico
He said ""It IS Rico, of all people
Gave his moms furs, called up the mayor
To get his crime pardoned, his son's godfather""
Said the nigga shot up my cars
Last night he laid for me to come out my doors?"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	Casualties of War	Don’t Sweat the Technique	1992	[Verse 3]	"The war is over, for now at least
Just because they lost it don't mean it's peace
It's a long way home, it's a lot to think about
Whole generation, left in doubt
Innocent families killed in the midst
It'll be more dead people after this
So I'm glad to be alive and walkin'
Half of my platoon came home in coffin
Except the general, buried in the Storm
In bits and pieces, no need to look for him
I played it slick and got away with it
Rigged it up so they would think they did it
Now I'm home on reserves and you can bet
When THEY call, I'm going AWOL
'Cause it ain't no way I'm goin' back to war
When I don't know who or what I'm fightin' for
So I wait for terrorists to attack
Every time a truck backfires, I fire back
I look for shelter when a plane is over me
Remember Pearl Harbor? New York could be over, G
Kamikaze, strapped with bombs
No peace in the East, they want revenge for Saddam
Did I hear gunshots, or thunder?
No time to wonder, somebody's goin' under
Put on my fatigues and my camouflage
Take control, 'cause I'm in charge
When I snapped out of it, it was blood, dead bodies on the floor
Causalities Of War"

Did it before, ain't scared to use my gat again
I look back in hindsight, the fight was irrelevant
But now he's the Devil's friend, too late to be tellin' him
He shot first and I'll be damned if I run away
Homie is done away, I should've put my gun away
I wasn't thinkin', all I heard was the ridicule
Girlies was laughin', Tup saying, ""Damn, homie's dissin' you""
Fired my weapon, started steppin' in the hurricane
I got shot, so I dropped feelin' a burst of pain
Got to my feet, couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
Now I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
Ran through an alley, still lookin' for my getaway
Copper say, ""Freeze, or you'll be dead today""
Trapped in a corner, dark and I couldn't see the light
Thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life
What do I do? Live my life in a prison cell?
I'd rather die than be trapped in a living Hell"

'Specially when you as bitch as Missy
Back to back LP's that sound the same, I surround the game

Charges don't stick to dude, he's Teflon
I'm too sexy for jail like I'm Right Said Fred

Mr. District Attorney, I'm not sure if they told you
I'm on TV every day, where the fuck could I go to?
Plus - Hov don't run, Hov stand and fight
Hov a soldier, Hov been fightin' all his life so
What could you do to me? It's not new to me
Sue me? Fuck you, what's a couple dollars to me?
But you will respect me, simple as that
Or I got no problem goin' back

You're makin' it harder, on my fellas
These dopefiend bitches, and the big drug sellers
How can you preach to the fiends that they should quit
While Barry's up in Washington smokin' that shit
You need to get yourself a life or keep tryin'
Or more and more cops'll be dyin', 'cause I am
Sick of seein' niggas bein' shortstopped
By a buck-oh-five, dick in the booty-ass cop
You figure you're hard 'cause you're a cop, see
Fuck with me, I'ma put that ass in a box, G

Kendrick Lamar	16	Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst	good kid, m.A.A.d city	2012	[Verse 2]	"You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit…"

I'm letting knowledge be born and my name's the R
A-K-I-M, not like the rest of them, I'm not on a list
That's what I'm saying, I drop science like a scientist
My melody's in a code, the very next episode
Has the mic often distorting, ready to explode
I keep the mic at Fahrenheit, freeze emcees and make 'em colder
The listener's system is kickin' like solar
As I memorize, advertise like a poet
Keep you going when I'm flowing, smooth enough, you know it
But rough, that's why the mural on my story I tell will be
Nobody beats the R, check out my melody"
Dr. Dre	1	Alwayz Into Somethin’	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Bridge]	"Yeah, the world's most dangerous group
Definitely in this motherfucker
Sendin' a shoutout to all the bitches out there
Yo, you can get in the pick up to suck a dick up 'til you hiccup
You know what I'm sayin'"
Eminem	15	Underground	Relapse	2009	[Outro]	"So, it wasn't a choice, it was ""I had to do this""
And now I got 90 days clean
And uh, that's all I have to share, thanks
(Thanks for sharing, Brian
Is there anyone else who'd like to share this evening?)
Yeah, I got something to share:
""When you walked through the door you were queer to me
So come here, baby boy, just come here to me
You're a cock-boy, everybody wants you
You're gayer than you would ever claim to
I won't have to rape you
So, homie, lay down, down, down
Lay down, down, down
Lay down, down, down, lay down, lay down""
Where's everybody going?
This always went over real big in Gay-A
Okay, wait, I got another one
""I just love condoms and lots of cum""
No? Well, shit!"
André 3000	27	Aquemini	Aquemini	1998	[Chorus]	"Even the Sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes, ""Y""
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
Nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
It's him and I: Aquemini"
50 Cent	19	If I Can’t	Get Rich or Die Tryin’	2003	[Outro]	"Uh-huh
I'ma make it hot
Dr. Dre, Aftermath
Shady, haha"
JAY-Z	6	99 Problems	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 3]	"Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' 'em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail 'cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got ninety-nine problems, bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me!"
OutKast	28	Elevators {ONP 86 Mix}	ATLiens	1996	[Chorus]	"Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors
Me and you, your momma and your cousin too
Rollin' down the strip on vogues
Comin' up slammin' Cadillac doors"

Big Pun	24	Parental Discretion	Capital Punishment	1998	[Verse 3]	"So forget the boom, one look, you shook
You know I'm stickin' you
Liftin' you off the ground, look down
That's where I'm puttin' you
Look in my eyes and remember me
How does it feel mentally havin' the enemy
Be the last thing you ever see?
The recipe is death and I'm the chef fricasseein' your flesh
Be my guest, but I ain't cleanin' the mess
Me and TS, we testin' niggas faith just to see their face
Expression, we guest in the States to death, beatin' the case
I'm in a state of grace, in a hated race, by the angered face
Couldn't fight us, made a virus, gave us AIDS
I paved the way 'cause they ain't get me yet, wet me or affect me yet
I know they comin', they just tryna let me sweat
I recollect when I was just a boy eatin' Chips Ahoy!
Wasn't allowed to raise my voice, now I'm makin' noise
No more toys, strictly MAC's and missiles
Shorties with 40's packin' pistols
Catchin' bodies makes you official
So they say, I pray there's a better way
My kids don't do as I do, they do as I say
'cause daddy don't play"
2Pac	18	Last Wordz	Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...	1993	[Verse 3]	"Now they're after me, why? 'Cause a nigga's Black
Spittin' facts and ain't afraid to pull a trigger back
Let 'em come step to a real motherfucker
(Boom Boom) Mama ain't raised no suckers
Dan Quayle, don't you know you need your ass kicked?
Where was you when there was niggas in the caskets?
Motherfucker rednecks all the same
Fear a real nigga if he ain't balled and chained
That's why we burn shit and wreck
'Cause the punk police ain't learned shit yet
You mutha-fuckas gonna pay the price
Can't make a Black life, don't take a Black life
It's on, the next real nigga fall dead
Dread, Jheri curl, process, or bald head
Be prepared for the smoke to bust
United we stand, divided we fall
They can shoot one nigga, but they can't take us all
Let's get along with the Mexicans
And we can all have peace on the sets again
Imagine that if it took place, ha (ha haaaa)
Keeping the smiles off they White face
I ain't racist but let's trade places
Trace the hate 'n then face it
One nigga teach two niggas
Three teach four niggas and them niggas teach more niggas
And when we blast that'll be the biggest blast you've heard
And them is my last wordz"
Eminem	15	My Mom	Relapse	2009	[Outro]	"My mom, I'm just like her

Me momma, I like-a da momma
Haha, sorry Mom
I still love you though!

Yo, take us on outta here
Woo!"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Little Weapon	Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool	2007	[Verse 2]	"Now here comes the march of the boy brigade
A macabre parade of the toys he made
In shemaghs and shades, who look half his age
About half the size of the flags they wave
And camouflage suits made to fit youths
'Cause the ones off the dead soldiers hang a lil' loose
Where AK47s that they shooting into heaven
Like they tryna kill a Jetson, the struggles, little recruits
Cute, smileless, heartless, violent
Childhood destroyed, devoid of all childish ways
Can't write their own names
Or read the words that's on they own graves
Think you gangsta? Popped a few rounds?
These kids'll come through and murder a whole town
Then sit back and smoke and watch it burn down
The grave gets deeper the further we go down, it's—"
Havoc	7	Where Ya From	Murda Muzik	1999	[Verse 1]	"Yo, ashes to ashes big gats to little
I put it to you clear while you cats talkin riddles
Snake and buck at me
If you did I'd say you got lucky
Trained to tread through land to get muddy"
Eminem	15	Bad Meets Evil	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Verse 1]	"I don't speak, I float in the air, wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
And the noise is spread
Picked up and transmitted through Royce's head
Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed
'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead
I asked him to come to the dark side
He made a choice and said
Is hellier than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist
Interceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life, when the black knight mounted the white horse
Collaboratin', attemptin' to take over the Earth"
Lil Uzi Vert	31	Lullaby	Pluto x Baby Pluto	2020	[Verse 1]	"Five, four, three, two, one
I was 'posed to love you until the sun was done
Said I changed when the money start comin'
How the fuck you think I wasn’t gon’ catch on to all that game you was runnin'?
See the mula, it got longer, but my mind, it got wider
That’s why you ain't want me to wear no condom
Now tell me what's that about?
Why you tellin' niggas about my stash spot?
She lucky I ain’t kill her, could've gave her an ass-shot
See, I'm not worried about them niggas, 'cause I got boys that's gon' crash out
See, drive up on your block, do the drive-by, and then smash out (Skrrt)
Whip it up in the kitchen, no potatoes, got mash out
Man, you see I don't care about love"
Nas	9	Rule	Stillmatic	2001	[Verse 3]	"Y'all know that's my style, to hit you at the right time
No other compares to what Nas write down
Tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours
You could get what you love, be a chain in cause
You alive right now
There's so many that's dead or locked up inside the beast, I'm a highlight now
It's whatever man think of manifest to the real
The plan is to wake up 'cause time reveals
All this hate can't forever last
All my ghetto heroes in Heaven, it's like you right here and never passed
You just transcend, I know I'm gon' see you again
Hoping I reach the world leaders and win
Ain't nothing without struggle, listen up, it's critical
We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical
In hip-hop, the weapons are lyrical
To be the best, you challenge the best, then the blessings are spiritual
Top of the world for the kid, none less
Poppin' any rapper's head off his shoulders, no contest
I know the Most High hear me, so fly you can't near me
You scared of a mirror, my theory is that knowledge is power
To every projects and every street corner, we gotta get ours now"
Kanye West	5	Devil In a New Dress	My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy	2010	[Chorus]	"Put your hands to the constellations

Cat got your tongue?"

Travis Scott	33	SKITZO	UTOPIA	2023	[Verse]	"I stick to the code, binary like I's and O's (Ooh)
I'm too exposed, I gotta keep curtains closed (Closed)
Her body bold, she hid it behind the clothes (Skeet, skeet, skeet)
I'm in Cabo, I'm hittin' these adios
Tryna balance all these up and downs, but I keep poppin' lows (Lows)
Man, it is what it is, that's just how it goes
Pure session, I just kept progressin', finally found the flow (Flow)
If the answer's down there with the devil, I may never know (Let's go)
My dawg just got freed out the precinct (Free)
Hid it in my bag, let's hit Turks for the weekend (Let's go)
Why did I pop two out that whole pack? Dawg, I'm tweakin' (Geeked)
Baby girl, come suck, keep me up, ain't no sleepin', ooh
She gon' let me beat that body up like we beefin' (Beefin')
Better yet she vegan (Vegan), better yet she tweakin' (Tweakin')
Yeah, 6 A.M., I hit my alarm clock (Yeah)
You see the vision, this shit non-stop, gotta keep my palms hot (Hot)
Got Longhorns in my backyard, bitch, I'm a lonestar
The droptop came with the top, I cut the door apart
My brodie keep a stainless to steal, ain't no Chrome Heart (Grr)"
Dr. Dre	1	Talking to My Diary	Compton	2015	[Bridge]	"Now puff-puff-pass got a nigga having flashbacks
I remember how it used to be

I remember how it used to be"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	No Competition	Follow the Leader	1988	[Verse 1]	"Competition is none
I remain at the top like the sun
And I burn whoever come
In the chambers of torture, I caught you
You should have brought your neighborhood to support you
No one in my path can withstand
Under pressure, the wrath of a swift man
You name the day, the grounds could be neutral
Speak your piece, the feeling's mutual
We can go topic from topic, whenever I drop it
Try to stop it
In other words, what the brother heard
He tried to catch it, but what occurred
Was too much weight for one brain to take
Try to concentrate maintain then elevate
From gram to ounce to pound to pound
The matter of weight can't hold my mind down
Permanent damage, I do away with
No time for fun 'cause I don't play with
Competitors, it's only one when I'm done"
André 3000	27	Stankonia (Stanklove)	Stankonia	2000	[Verse 1]	"You make me understand
What it means to be in l-o-v-e once again

Are we 'fraid of heights, do kites get lost in the tow"
Prodigy	8	It’s Mine	Murda Muzik	1999	[Verse 2]	"I got the style of a stillborn child, I'm ill
If it's beef, poke him with the fork, make sure he's done well (Very-very)
The streets raised me crazy, now I'm immune to it
So when they start shootin', we don't stop the music
Keep it movin', that's how we do it (C'mon, c'mon, dunn)
Been through more drama than the Baldwins, you still crawlin' (Still crawlin')
Apply street rules to the office, high performance
Rap author, made millions off of
Melodic, hypnotic productions
That'll fuck with your conscience and touch your emotions (You feel me? You feel me?)
You feel me? I'll write a graphic page
Escort niggas to they grave, relate to the projects
We the Black Mobb, it gets deeper than rap music (Don't get no realer than this)
It's more real than any words I can muster
Pull the black Cadillac trucks up (What?)
Hop out them shits like what? Y'all niggas can't touch us"
Nas	9	Rule	Stillmatic	2001	[Verse 1]	"I come from the housing tenement buildings
Unlimited killings, menaces marked for death
Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell
Though I owe to it my success
With survival of the fittest every day as a child
I would think I'm a part of U.S.A. and be proud
Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign
Like, the darker you are the realer your problems
I reached for the stars, but I just kept slipping
On this life mission, never know what's next
Ancient kings from Egypt up to Julius Caesar
Had a piece of the globe, every continent
Yo, there's Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan
Pakistan, America, Afghanistan
Yo, there's Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics
Call a truce, world peace, stop acting like savages
No war, we should take time and think
The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct
But since the beginning of time, it's been men with arms fighting
Lost lives in the Towers and Pentagon, why then
Must it go on? We must stop the killing
Tell me why we die, we all God's children"
Lloyd Banks	34	I’m So Hood	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Chorus]	"I'm so hood, I can't help it

Can't rearrange it, I am what I am
So love me for bein' me
I'm so hood, I can't help it

Kendrick Lamar	16	Auntie Diaries	Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers	2022	[Verse 1]	"My auntie is a man now
I think I'm old enough to understand now
Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Motorola pager, off-white Guess jacket
Blue Air Max's, gold chains, and curl kits
'93 Nissan wax job, the earliest
Big social, big personality, vocal
Played the underground verbatim and stayed local
My auntie is a man now
I watch him and his girl hold their hands down
Tip of the avenues under street lights made his
Thinking, ""I want me a bad bitch when I get big""
They hug on the corner like California King
Cold hand all up her skirt, cars whistling down the road
See, my auntie is a man now, slight bravado
Scratching the likes from lotto
Hoping that she pull up tomorrow
So I can hang out in the front seat
Six-by-nines keeping the music up under me
My auntie is a man now
Asked my momma why my uncles don't like him that much
And at the parties why they always wanna fight him that much
She said, ""Ain't no tellin'
Niggas always been jealous because he had more women
More money and more attention made more envy
Calling him anything but broke was less offending"""
Havoc	7	It’s Mine	Murda Muzik	1999	[Verse 1]	"Straight thugs on this side, it's do or die to the death
Like the terminal ill takin' they last breath
Read your last rites, God, forgive me
For the sin I'm about to commit, takin' a life
Kill or be killed, rather that than somebody else
Readin' my will, you feel what I feel, you know the deal
Keep the infrared next to my bed, one in the head
Hearin' noises, dead tired, eyes bloodshot red
Sleep with half closed eyelids
Some say it's strange, sometimes that's how strange life get
Go easy on the bottle, niggas love to see when
Niggas slippin' off point, on the strength they bet
Scopin' your ice, appraisin' it like the Diamond District
Jeweler with they hand on the biscuit
Do ya, wanna get caught lifted
Or sober, so you can react quick?
Blow you off the atlas as if I caught you fuckin' my wife
On my thousand dollar mattress
It's the world that I live in, Q.B. made me
A moms that loved me and a pops that raised me"

'Fore a nigga had the locks, 'fore a nigga had the chain, 'fore I had the bops
Always kept my city on me like it was a swatch
Every time we in the party, took it up a notch
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout this new girl and she doin' pop
Wanna know? My dick longer than a Pringle box
Tired of seein' these black kids on the face of FOX
And fuck CNN, they don't wanna see us win
Mama, don't you worry no, no more, worry no, no more

Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to the 'Bleau, she tried to sip the fountain
That's when David Grutman kicked her out
But I got her back in and put my dick in her mouth"

Big Pun	24	Fast Money	Capital Punishment	1998	[Verse 3]	"Ayo it's time to pay, and I ain't trying to give my shine away
Let's show these pigs how much we give a fuck about a brighter day
I cock the Eagle, Cuban drew the Glock, it was diesel
Said, ""See you in Hell coppers"", and started poppin' like it was legal
We need a plan, if we can make it to the van
Missile launchers there with the grenade pistol I bought from Uncle Dan
Me and my man are runnin' out of ammo, I got about a handful of Black Rhinos and two Rambos strapped to my ankles
I trampled over one of the bodies, I grabbed the steel
Threw the bitch over my shoulder and used her butt as a shield
I filled the clip with the little bit of bullets remaining
Cuban said, ""Move your fat ass faster motherfucker, they gaining""
I gave him the case, told him, ""Go 'head, save yourself
Blaze a L in my memory, tell the family I gave 'em Hell""
For real, that's when I heard the tires screechin'
Peeped and it was Joe the God with twenty Terror Squad niggas reachin'
*conversation and gunfight to fade*"

Now I'm a veteran, spit a 16 sixteen ways
Sixteen in a clip, spit it 16 ways
I know six teens, pull up to a sweet sixteen and spray
I'm like sixteen Jay's but the beat I can manage
So every sweet 16 is like Duke and Kansas
You bout to lose advantage, I will come through crews and bandits
Bruise and damage, fuck your rules and manners
I kick back, click clack, bump the Wu in Phantoms
Fuck rap, I only respect Ja Rule and Hammer
Maybe the old Em, I'm Slim and I'm shady
Maybe the old him or Rakim
You niggas keep bullshittin' like Joakim
You so him, I'm so not, you so bitch, I sold rock
My four-four cocked, I been a Top Dawg, I know Dot

Five million sold livin' in the dope spot

Scarface	11	Hand of the Dead Body	The Diary	1994	[Verse 2]	"So now they trying separation
And sending black folks in white coats to infiltrate our congregation
Tapping into our conversation
Saying the message that they give
Bring forth or premeditation
So David's got a silver mag
While listening to Brad, David gets pissed and kills his dad
David Duke's got a shotgun
So why you get upset cause I got one
A tisket a tasket
A nigga got his ass kicked
Shot in the face by a cop, close casket
An open and shut situation
Cop gets got, the wanna blame it on my occupation
If you don't dig me, than nigga you can sue me
Because the shit that I be saying ain't worse than no western movie
Don't blame me blame your man Gotti
So you can feel the hand of the dead body"
Scarface	11	For Real	The Untouchable	1997	[Verse 3]	"Game made a big shift since '86 when I started
Seems like niggas with hustle got outsmarted
'Cause now they wanna analyze they homies for scratch
Catch them when they sleeping come down and up scrap
And even though I plotted hittin' niggas for ends
I never took out straps and shot gats at friends
It was all about being for real where I was from
Where very few niggas came real but I was one
I dedicate this to my homies stuck in battle
Living life being caught up in this muthafuckin' gamble
The game made to be changed but the niggas still started
Cocaine seems to be blamed for the niggas gettin slaughtered
How many times you had your homie shot
By the same muthafucker whose gang came from your homie's block
Niggas get caught up in the paper chase
And lose respect for the game
That was honored before the cake was made"
Snoop Dogg	0	Round Here	Tha Blue Carpet Treatment	2006	[Chorus]	"It ain't safe to leave the house

Big L	25	Size ’Em Up	The Big Picture	2000	[Verse 2]	"Aiyo, I hear a lot of bitch in your talk, see a lot of switch in your walk
Only thugs get rich in New York
Time is runnin' out, niggas like, ""L, when you comin' out?""
Because they sick of all this drag queen shit
Your wife's missin', I'm the nigga she was last seen wit'
Me and Ron hit it up on some tag team shit
A bunch of niggas got smoked for the cash
Used to ride Greyhounds with dime hoes who stuff the coke in their ass
Crazy beef's got provoked in the past, lot of wigs got split
A lot of innocent kids got hit
Harlem World be the place of my birth, believe me son
We breed the smoothest niggas on the face of the Earth
Mics I steadily smoke, rhymes cleverly wrote
As long as I can rock a crowd, I'ma never be broke
Some hoes treated me like a bum nerd when I was unheard
Now I'm icey, I ain't gotta say one word, you dumb bird
I push whips while you walk all day
And I hate when strange niggas wanna talk all day
Clown ass shit, hate to be around that shit
You don't know me, just say what's up, give me a pound, that's it
When I was at the steak house, pullin' cake out
You was at some cheap Chinese shit gettin' take out
How you make out, you took the fake route, you ought to break out
You couldn't get a bitch before you put your tape out"

So trife your life could disappear
And if you ain't careful who you fuckin' wit nigga
Now reappear come here come near so you can hear what I spit
So sick and tired of niggas standin on that ""G"" shit
And just because you on starz wit some khakis
And think your rap style can out rap me and now jack me
Come here nigga slap yo self
Thats probably why yo shit still sittin' on the motherfuckin shelf
And mine sold out ever since it came out
Blue carpet roll out, #1 no doubt, mo' clout, down south, mixin' it up
With dem niggas that don't never hesitate to bust
What you niggas tappin' on my front door for?
Hmm, oh you lookin' for yo ho? (you heard)

JAY-Z	6	December 4th	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 3]	"Goodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush
Your blood boils you in the spot, knowin' cops could rush
And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch
No two days are alike except the first and fifteenth, pretty much
And ""trust"" is a word you seldom hear from us
Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up
And the drought will define a man when the well dries up
You learn the worth of water without work
You thirst 'til you die, yup!
And niggas get tied up for product
And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up
To show mothers they really got 'em
And this was the stress I lived with
'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven
For every bad decision I made, every sister I played
‘Cause I'm still paranoid to this day
And it's nobody fault, I made the decisions I made
This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me"

I play the block, I ain't the type to punch a clock
I'm the type to put the pedal to the floor in the drop
I live life in the fast lane, I mix dro wit hash
Hustle hard for cash so I can spoil that ass
It's like she loves me, she loves me not
Cause her friends pump her head full of bullshit a lot
I gave her jewels that I caught of a jux
Chanel bags I bought from boosters
To the hood I introduced her
She feisty, every now and then she wanna fight me
People saying if I get knocked she ain't gon' write me
The sick part is all that bullshit excites me"

Please leave it alone, don't throw rocks at the throne
Do not bark up that tree, that tree will fall on you
I don't know why your advisers ain't forewarn you
Please, not Jay, he's not for play
I don't slack a minute, all that thug rappin' and gimmicks
I will end it, all that yappin' be finished
You are not deep, you made your bed, now sleep
Don't make me expose you to them folks that don't know you

Dominate the game, let's have a rule, combinations
No conversation, bring on your good confrontation
You hesitatin', ass bettin', that's bad business

Now put that in your little pipe and bite down
Think for a minute, 'cause the hype just died down
That I won't go up in the Oval Office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down
I'm all for America, fuck the government
Tell that C. Delores Tucker slut to suck a dick
Motherfucker ducked, what the fuck? Son of a bitch
Take away my gun, I'm gonna tuck some other shit
Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switchblade with a little switch to switch blades
And switch from a six to a sixteen-inch blade
Shit's like a samurai sword, a sensei

As smart as MacGyver, could put honor inside the heart of a liar
Involved in a life of crime, fuck it, I like the shine
Up in the white and lime, clutched with the pipe design
Plushed out (No doubt), both pockets about to bust out
If you not in it for the spinach, GET THE FUCK OUT!
Take a hike, we can even battle to make it right
Go 'head, lace the mic, you finished? SAY GOODNIGHT!
Head-to-head in the street, I'll leave you dead on your feet
Settlin' beef, I'll even let you rhyme to the ""Benjamins"" beat

I used to see 'em on stage
Earnin' money like a thief, but without a gauge
Until I got full of clockin' the lame, gettin' pull
(They said you wasn't gon' get paid) Nah, that's bullshit!
They like it stylistic, and I enchant the crowd like I'm a mystic
(C-C-C-C) C-C-C-cameras are flashin' when I'm in action

Pure simplicity — see, it's elementary

I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire"
Jay-Z	12	Money, Cash, Hoes	Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life	1998	[Verse 1]	"J-A-Y, I flow sick (Uh)
Fuck all y'all haters, blow dick
I spits the game for those that throw bricks
Money, cash, hoes, money, cash, chicks (What?)
Sex, murder and mayhem; romance for the street (Uh-huh)
Only wife of mines is a life of crime, and since
Life's a bitch in mini-skirts and big chest
How can I not flirt with death?
That's life's enigma, long as life within us
We gon' sin a lot and pray that Christ forgive us, fuck it
Ice the wrist and raise the price on these niggas
Y'all can't floss on my level
I'll invite you all to get with us if your ball is glitter
When I go, on the hall of players, wall my picture (Uh-huh)
If you get close enough, you can read the scripture
It reads: ""Money, cash, hoes"", how real was that nigga? (What)"

I'm tryna effect by kicking the facts
And stacking much mail
I'm packing a gat 'cause cops wanna jack
And fuck going to jail
'Cause I ain't a crook, despite how I look
I don't sell yayo
They judging us brothers like covers on books
Follow me into a flow
I'm sure you know which way to go
I'm hitting 'em out of the doors
So simple and slow, they step on the flow
I'm fucking the sluts and hoes
The bigger the butts, the tighter the clothes
They givin' ya jim many blows
Then what do you know? It's off with some clothes
Proud when the crowd says ""ho""
That let's me know they know I can flow
I love when they come to my shows
I get up and go with skins before
When I'm collecting my dough
I let 'em respect the way that I rep
The quicker the nigga can wreck
The bigger the check, now watch how they sweat
Now what kind of style is that?
The style of a mack and ready to jack
I ran through the piles of wack
The wacker the pack, the fatter the smack
They hate it when real niggas bust
They hate when I cuss, they threaten to bust
I had enough of the fuss
I bust what I bust and cuss when I must
They gave me a charge for sales
For selling the tales of young Black males"

Then he hugged me and then he turned around
I threw the duffel bag over my shoulder
It was time to get props, kid, 'cause now I'm older
Time to fend for myself, jack
So I'ma go for mine and maybe never come back
Stopped at the lye spot before I hit the train station
Needed some boom for the mental relaxation
It took the last of my loot to make this move, troop
But I ain't even tryin to work in a suit
Plus my aunt's got a room that's for rent
As long as there's no hoes and I don't come home bent
So fuck the bullshit, I'm outie
I'm on a mission, 'cause if I stay I'll go crazy

I was in fight mode and now it's ""Fuck me, mijo""
I was movin' them kilos, help you move your peoples
Sometimes you need your ego, gotta remind these fools

Before we had A&R's, we had AR's too
We the only ones really movin' like y'all say y'all do
We still movin' like y'all niggas say y'all did

Take a night-night? Na-na-boo, goo-goo-ga-ga?

Conquer the enemy armed with education
Protect yourself, reach for what you want to do
Know thyself, teach by what we've been through
Armed with the knowledge of the place we've been
No one will ever oppress this race again
No Malcolm X in my history text, why's that?
’Cause he tried to educate and liberate all Blacks
Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week?
He told Blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek
I don't get it, so many questions went through my mind
I get sweated, they act like asking questions a crime
But forget it, 'cause one day I'm gonna prove them wrong
Not every brother had his mother on the welfare line
The American Dream, though it seems like it's attainable
They're pulling your sleeve, don't believe, ’cause it'll strangle ya
Pulling the life of your brain, I can't explain
Beg as you can obtain from which you came
You swear to your mother that you living in equality
Forgetting your brother that's living here in poverty
Thought they had us beaten when they took out King
But the battle ain't over 'til the Black man sings
Words of wisdom
The battle ain't over 'till the Black man sings, words of wisdom"

Gangsta philosophy, yep yep I gotta be
Real high, whenever writing my novelty
Because it adds to my celebrity

Is it in the clouds like they said it would be?
I wonder when I die will he give me receipts?
I wonder will the eyes of the Lord look at me?
Look at me, look at me, I'm a loser, I'm a winner
I'm good, I'm bad, I'm a Christian, I'm a sinner
I'm humble, I'm loud, I'm righteous, I'm a killer

Straight pulled the muthafuckin' trigger and said ""I got her!""
But I had better plans to give her the blues
Like dumpin' her in the river with cement shoes
I knew my money was comin' up short in the vault
But the stupid bitch thought she'd never get caught
Came home early and straight bust her ass
On the couch with her other nigga countin' my cash
I shoulda knew she was like them other hoes
I told the two motherfuckaz to take off their clothes
Butt naked, nothin' left but the shoes
I had up a nine so they couldn't refuse
I shot the nigga, he was outta there
And tied up the bitch to the motherfuckin' chair
Now there's one less bitch I gotta worry about
Everybody out, that's how it turns out"

Intellect pitches new trends like a clothes designer
I'm in effect, quicker than medicines in China
Split the mic open, fill it with somethin' potent to go in
And take a toke then mental planes start floatin'
Hot science is smokin', altitudes cause chokin'
Product is hypnotic, you're soakin' and still smokin'
Showin' better scenes than grams of amphetamines
Plans to scheme, means I'll forever fiend
Long as the mic is loud and the volume's pumpin'
I'mma move crowds to two-thousand and somethin'"

Nas	9	You Won’t See Me Tonight	I Am...	1999	[Verse 1]	"I'm the most wanted baby father, save the drama
We toast when I wine and dine ya -- all you need is me
I won't stress you but bless you
Mentally and sexual, we both intellectual
Can't forget how I met you;
You thought I was a boxer Prince Naseem
But I'm the mobster -- Nas from Queens
And when I gotcha - you riding with me
You keep asking, ""When do you have time for me?""
I'm never free always on the move, business oriented
Lifestyle expensive, attract women
You wanna search my pockets, and act all wild
Say I hurt your heart - ask how could I smile?
Wanna call back all my numbers - star 6-9 me
Check my car for rubbers, but quit trying
Before you find what you looking for and get to crying
You always saying what you gon' do if you catch me lying"
Nas	9	Destroy & Rebuild	Stillmatic	2001	[Verse 2]	"Since we on the subject of traitors and flunkies
Mega ain't the only faggot in my hood, dummies
There's plenty that wanna be me but cannot
It's like King Arthur and Knight Sir Lancelot
Lefty and Donnie Brasco, Gotti and Paul
Before I woulda told you Prodigy's my dog
Through the ups and downs, robberies and all
Though I always knew he wanted my downfall
He would say his little slick shit and act real funny
For what, nigga? You're butt and it got back to me
Askin' a Braveheart to help get back your jewelry
You ain't from my hood, don't even rep Q.B
Nature moved to Marcy
(Man dick riding Nature) Nothing else to say
Man, Nature moved to Marcy (What? Far)
Backward ass niggas, man, fuck them niggas (Far away)
Go 'head with the program, man, proceed
Old lady pocketbook snatcher, car thief
Course we ain't friends, you never stood on no blocks
Streets or corners with zombies, ghouls and gangstas
Cops, drug dealers with pools of blood anger
Just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot
And get filthy rich, it's just not
No more morals, no loyalty, no more community
Queensbridge, we gotta have unity"
Eminem	15	Berzerk	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Chorus 1]	"We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down

Life's too short to not go for broke

Yeah bitch, you got a big ol' butt
Hidin it, should be dividin it
It's real tight now but I got a way to widen it
And slide in it, real smooth like
With a little bit of Miles Davis to get you in the mood like
Zoom boom hit the poom-poom right
Just to get your groove right
I can make it happen, but it can't happen if you ain't good at it
When you gon' let a nigga have a look at it?
Callin all cars, yeah baby girl you a star
But it's on you if you wanna go real far
Now let me get a glimpse, one for the pimps
I, have one question, answer me this"

2Pac	18	Soulja’s Story	2Pacalypse Now	1991	[Verse 1]	"Crack done took a part of my family tree
My mama's on the shit, my daddy split and moms is steady blaming me
Is it my fault, just cause I'm a young Black male?
Cops sweat me as if my destiny is makin' crack sales
Only fifteen and got problems
Cops on my tail, so I bail 'til I dodge 'em
They finally pull me over and I laugh
""Remember Rodney King?"" and I blast on his punk ass
Now I got a murder case
You speak of Heaven punk? I never heard of the place
Wanted to come up fast, got a Uz' and a black mask
Ducking fuckin' task, now who's the jackass?
Keep my shit cocked cause the cops got a Glock too
What the fuck would you do? Drop them or let 'em drop you?
I chose droppin' the cop
I got me a Glock, and a Glock for the niggas on my block
Mama tried to stab me, I moved out
Sold a pound a weed, made Gs, bought a new house
I'm only seventeen, I'm the new king
Got me a crew, bought 'em jewels, and a Uz'-thing
But all good things don't last
Task came fast, and busted my Black ass
Coolin' in the pen, where the good's kept
Now my little brother wants to follow in my footsteps, a soldier"

Started with an eightball, gotta get this cake, dog
Give niggas a break? Nah, you know how the game go
Fuck you think I slang for? To go against the grain? (No!)
I'm out here in grind mode, wrapped up in the paper chase
I wanna fuck a fine ho and candy-paint the '88
Don't got no wholesale, 'cause that ain't how I wanna run it
Here, take these five stones, and bring a nigga back a hundred
Gotta set my feet dude, you do shit a fiend do
The fire get too hot in the kitchen, I hit the streets, fool
Money is an issue, and that's on the fo'-shizzle, my nizzle
Your block warm, and I come by with the fizzle
And make for sure I get to work mines, a car at a time
We go to war, and you ain't making a dime, haha!
'Cause I got shit to lose; a nigga out here paying his dues
My baby walking, gotta get him some shoes"

They don't know you, think they know you too well
You jel like Flubber
I hover above the city in a private jet, the livest set
Press you're brakes, Feds wanna investigate
Mr. I don't cop nothing less than eight
And anything involved with my name, regardless of the fame
It's hard, I can't even walk through Harlem again
Charge it to the game, I'm platinum like American Express
My boy died, and all I did was inherit his stress
To make every jam tougher, you ain't my man, fuck ya
I should just let you live, right? Negative, I swear
It's dough or die, I hope your soul provides you with an afterlife
Close your casket tight, take your last two deep breaths
And pass the mic, to Jay-Z nigga, that's right!"

Slide on you like fallen drapes
God toss full of carnivals
I kill 'em with kindness
Or I kill 'em with diamonds
Or I put up like fifteen hundred
Get yo' ass killed by the finest
Everything in life is a gamble
Nothin' in life I can't handle
Seen it all, done it all, felt pain more
For the cause, I done put blood on sword
Everything I do is to embrace y'all
Everything I write is a damn eight ball
Everything I touch is a damn gold mine
Everything I say is from an angel"

It ain't my fault you don' fucked up your re-up
At the dice game, who told you put a G up?
Everybody mad when they paper don't stack right
But when I come around y'all niggas better act right

Man actin' as if he was the supreme being
Clockin' the souls of men out like he was G-O-D and
W-A-R-ah, there'll be no tomorrow but sorrow
And horror will follow the hollow hearts battle for dollars
Politicians, modern-day magicians
Physicians of death, more health care for poor health
Who makin' us ill, they makin' us kill
That's makin' me spill my guts (Chill Big, lay in the cut!)
For what? I refuse to sit in the backseat and get handled
Like I do nothin' all day but sit around, watch the cartoon channel
I rap about, the Presidential election and the scandal
That followed, and we all watched the nation as it swallowed
And chalked it up; basically America, you got fucked
The media shucked and jived, now we stuck, damn"

So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lecter into guy sex and I bet ya
I tantalize ya and in less than five seconds I get ya
They say once bitten then twice shy, well I'm next to the guy
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ripped condoms in quantities, why yes sir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser
That's my kind of vibe, what else should I try, Lester?
Drop-kick the bitch before her second trimester
Perform the home abortion with Dexter, then I guess I'll
Dig her fetus out with a wire hanger, then digest her"

With the high beams on, me and the devil sharin' chronic blunts
Listenin' to the  album
Playin' backwards, shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge (Compton, Compton)
Made my grandmother pray for good, it never made her happy
But I bet that new Mercedes could 
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
And it took so many of my niggas that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should 
With the top back
In my Sox hat
I'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
I still keep this motherfucker cocked back"

Lloyd Banks	34	Baby U Got	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Verse 3]	"Baby you got a hell of a first impression
Making me wanna ask you a personal question
Like ""Are you flexible?"" and ""How do you like it?""
Give me a little input, I'm not a psychic
'Cause we can exit soon as you give the okay
You got a body like Nicole Wray, hey
I need a drink, I'll be right back
But before I go, do that little dance, yeah, just like that
It's late, I have to score, ""This blue drink tastes good, don't it?""
""Sure it does, now have some more""
I'm deep, but she got her ladies with her
So bring 'em or call ya babysitter
So we can hit the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
I'm contemplating how my time's spent

You move like you work in a strip club (woo!)"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Mother I Sober	Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers	2022	[Verse 1]	"I'm sensitive, I feel everything, I feel everybody
One man standin' on two words, heal everybody
Transformation, then reciprocation, karma must return
Heal myself, secrets that I hide, buried in these words
Death threats, ego must die, but I let it purge
Pacify, broken pieces of me, it was all a blur
Mother cried, put they hands on her, it was family ties
I heard it all, I should've grabbed a gun, but I was only five
I still feel it weighin' on my heart, my first tough decision
In the shadows clingin' to my soul as my only critic
Where's my faith? Told you I was Christian, but just not today
I transformed, prayin' to the trees, God is taking shape
My mother's mother followed me for years in her afterlife
Starin' at me on back of some buses, I wake up at night
Loved her dearly, traded in my tears for a Range Rover
Transformation, you ain't felt grief 'til you felt it sober"
Havoc	7	Extortion	Hell On Earth	1996	[Verse 3]	"Extortion is the key, I got the key for extortion
Spend your fortune, dead your shorty like abortion
Take precaution, Infamous laws enforced in
You married to the Mobb, can't take it? Then divorce it
'Cause I ain't got no time for them domestic disputes
If you scared, get a dog, don't got a clique? Then recruit
You're weak, troop, lost battalion in the mist
On your name, I shit, take it like a man, you little bitch"
The Game	13	No More Fun and Games	The Documentary	2005	[Verse 2]	"I'm like Dre, Eazy, Cube, King Tee and Ren rolled in one
Used to move birdies 'til I put a hole in one
Nigga that thought I wasn't holdin a gun
And tried to ride up on me like Afeni Shakur's only son
Dre told me he ain't doin' Detox, this his only run
Ma$e comin back, and Hov, he done
I'm surrounded by legends, sittin' at the round table
I am The Game, and still niggas tryna play dude
I'm ruthless, I ain't talkin' 'bout the label
I'll hook niggas up, and I don't mean free cable
I mean I'll hook niggas up to them IV's
The same way Dre hooked me up to Iovine
I'm from the gutter, grew up in public housing
On the same block with a shack like Yao Ming
So if a nigga ever try to Jerry Heller me
Tell Dre put up a mill, cause that's what my bail'll be"

Jesus Christ, the king of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' ""Dixie""
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? (Huh?), I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, 'cause I'm a motherfuckin'"

Most definitely, if not you, kill somebody belated
Sound foul with a subject, dunn, no women or kids
Dump you up under a bridge in a cardboard box
I'm like nothin to do wit it, believe it or not
I'm washin my hands to get bent with Henney or rock
Up in the rep bangin my chest off, pealin my socks
Niggas do it to death, I sleep with my 6 cocked
Like Henney rock, one sip, ya love it a lot
While you sleepin, I'm creapin wit the intricate plot
Cuz picture me up in the morgue, way before my time
Picture you tryin to get my while I'm still tryin to get mines
Asshole, have ya brain lookin like Castro
Dunn, I heard you wanted me (be careful what you ask for)
Bitch, if I buck you, damn Short snitched
The nigga just mad cuz he can't cop crisp"

The Game	13	Higher	The Documentary	2005	[Verse 2]	"Like Dre did
I created a buzz without a single like N.W.A. did
From the hood liquor store to the state pen
This is Gin & Juice to Doc
Make the club R.O.C. without Timberland boots
First nigga to put 'draulics on a Bentley Coupe
You wanna pimp? I'll perm my shit up like Snoop 
""Chronic 2005"" muh'fucker
Put the purple in the dutch ""Let it Burn"" like Usher - girl
Drop down, do the eagle, fuck that
Real niggas just pull up they pants and lean back - girl

Or you can take a ride on the magic stick"

While Pun talkin' to us Jam Jay still spinnin'
To every nigga listenin', I was supposed to be amongst kings
My mom shouted out at my christenin'
And while you still listenin', Shyne locked in a manhole
And Cam got shot inside his Lambo, it's ample
Life is a gamble, 15 years old, red rag around my head
My sisters used to laugh and call me Rambo
Seen Eazy's legacy melt away like a candle
I rekindled the flame, Dre created The Game
Nigga Wit a Attitude, from the cloth I came
Young homie ate his way up from the bottom of the food chain
Keep the crown, clown. I rock a L.A. Dodger fitted
Showed my ass at Summer Jam but New York was down wit' it
Now the ball's in my court never dribble out of bounds wit' it
Behind the back to Nas he alley oop to Jigga, nigga"

So if you fuck with Blood, then you fuck with us

And the punk police can't fade me
And maybe we can have peace someday, G
But right now I got my mind set up
Lookin' down the barrel of my nine, get up
'Cause it's time to make the payback fat
Tell my brothers on the block–better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
In case ya can't see when we burned the other week
Now we got 'em in a smash, blast
How long will it last 'til the po' get mo' cash
Until then, raise up!
Tell the young black males, blaze up!
Life's a mess don't stress, test
I'm givin' but be thankful that you're livin', blessed
Much love to my brothers in the pen'
See ya when I free ya if not when they shove me in
Once again it's an all out strapped
Keep ya hands on ya gat, now your boys watch ya back

Mess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya
Scream, if ya feel me; see it clearly?
You're too near me"

Never know who the hater, niggas cater to your ego
I'm sorry like Atari, who's the cousin to Coleco
Vision, caught a RICO, back on the street like Chico
DeBarge, he large and got a 'Lac in the garage
Few parts here and there, I declare hard
My Lord, one at Clark, one at Spelman
Both know each other and it's cool, you can tell when
He step off in the party, women jump for joy

Back in the day when we was slaves, I bet we was some cool-ass niggas
But now we vultures, slam my nigga back out
To make his ass black out
Or even pull your fuckin' heater to make his whole crew believers
You harder than a bitch, you're full of dicks
But that don't be soundin' like king shit to me
Seen out in the ghetto, or should I be sayin' Lakewood?
You better be strapped 'cause them niggas over there just ain't good
Just bein' a hustler, servin' the loyal customers
Rent was due on the first of the month, so I'm hustlin'
I'll buy you fifty-box of Phillies at the Citgo
And nigga be wantin' drinks and shit from the fuckin' store, yo
But that's alright though 'cause I be gettin' paid
And every trip I take, there's a dollar to be made
I'm diggin' through my pockets for my earnings, got you five

The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation"

Lupe Fiasco	23	They.Resurrect.Over.New.	Tetsuo & Youth	2015	[Verse 2]	"Coolest, tulips; flowers, fall from the towers
Like balls from Galileo to lay low, ignorance is that the world isn't ours—the gall!
Give them all showers, Tony found the fountain of youth, in the mountain of powder
To only find truth in the fountain, drownin' in power, surrounded with dollars
The moon surrounds us like spoons moving chowder—cut—that's a misdirect
To stir the soul with diseffect, names don't last like Mr. X, unless you Galilee
Droppin' bowling balls on the discotheque, with a disco ball hanging 'round your neck
Dance—it's a new year, every time I open my hands
Thoughts moving circles and the thoughts universal, yokozunas throwing salt in the circle
Sumo you up off off your turf boy, tsunami you up off your surfboard
Midas turn Medusas into gold, 'fore Versace turned words into turquoise
Medusa turned coke into stone with a hand on her thigh, she looked me in the eye and said—"

All my hoes do shrooms, nigga, all my hoes do coke
Twenty-carat ring, I put my fingers down her throat (Uh, uh, uh)
If I lose a carat, she might choke (Uh, uh, uh)
I know she gon' swallow, she a G.O.A.T. (Uh, uh, uh)
Freeband nigga, bring the racks in
Got the shooters in the corner like the pack in
She think 'cause she exotic bitch, she attractive
That's that shit'll get you put up out the section, brrt
And the motto still the same
Ball like I won a championship game
You know these hoes hungry, they gon' fuck for a name
I put her on the gang, she get fucked for a chain
Got your girl in this bitch, she twirlin' on the dick
I got syrup in this bitch, turn up in this bitch
And we brought the 'Ercs in this bitch, get murked in this bitch
All these pointers on me, baby, you know it's game time
Bring a friend, bitch, we fucked 'em at the same time

Nas	9	Still Dreaming	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Verse 2]	"How you a man waiting for the next man to get rich?
Your plan is to stick out your hand real quick
So if he feed your family and he serve you shit
Then he need that head you get and he deserve your bitch
Since you wishin' cash fall from the sky all your life
Dwellin' on the past when you was alright
When you was getting cash but wasn't too bright
Now your luck down, you feel like bustin' them shells
Nobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self
Want niggas to show you, how to come up with green
I schemed since I'm 14, what the fuck was your dream?
Rental cars, little broads, saying you was seen
With little niggas with a chain, you was doing your thing
How high was I? You the thousandth guy
That came around thinking we can see eye to eye, we on a different echelon
Could've got bread together, now you get skedded on"
Guru	20	Now You’re Mine	Hard to Earn	1994	[Verse 2]	"I'll fake you left and go right, straight down the lane
Here's one in your eye, you'll feel pain
You strain to put together some strategy
But you're raggedy and I'll be glad to see
The frown on your grill when I drill and thrill
Set up my offense, commence to kill
I'll be leadin' from beginning to end
And after I pound ya, you're gonna wanna make friends
And make amends for the silly trash you were talkin'
Take a walk and your shots I'm swattin'
With ease, and the ladies are swoonin'
Clockin' my swiftness while you're droolin'
You oughta practice up and get your game refined
I've been waitin' to dog you and now you're mine"

Burp, belch and go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm saying, man? Can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my stepfather felt me (Oh...)
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping
""Shady, what the fuck you saying?"" — I don't know, help me!
What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fuckin' melting
""Marshall, I just love you, boy, I care about your well-being""
No, Dad, I said no! I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself, see?
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X and they called it ""Pubic Hair on Chelsea""
""Well, this is called 'Ass Rape', and we're shooting the jail scene"""

A man in his feelings with bitter nerve
What is a woman that really hurt?
A demon, you're better off killing her
What is a relative making repetitive narratives
On how you did it first?
That is a predator, hit reverse
All of your presidents' evil thirst
What is a neighborhood rep'table?
That is a snitch on a pedestal
What is a house with a better view?
A family broken in variables
What is a rapper with jewelry?
A way that I show my maturity
What if I call on security?
That mean I'm calling on God for purity
I went and got me a therapist
I can debate all my theories and sharing it (Woah)
Consolidate all my comparisons
Humblin' up because time was imperative (Woah)
Started to feel like it's only one answer
To everything, I don't know where it is (Woah)
Popping a bottle of Claritin (Woah)
Is it my head or my arrogance? (Woah)
Shaking and moving, like, what am I doing?
I'm flipping my time through the Rolodex
Indulging myself in my life and my music
The world that I'm in is a cul-de-sac
The world that we in is just menacing
The demons portrayed as religionous
I wake in the morning, another appointment
I hope the psychologist listenin'"

But I'm a man, and sometimes a man do what he gotta do
Remember, I'm from Compton too
I saw you and Eazy in 'em so I started wearin' Khaki suits
I was 12 smokin' chronic, in '92
I had a choice, be like Mike, or be like you
I made a choice, now it's be Crip or be Piru
Whatever I was, I was bangin' Gin & Juice
Never knew back then, I'd be friends with Snoop
Now I gotta keep it gangsta 'cause it's in my roots
So I owe you my life, when I betrayed you
I tried to think of what the fuck Eminem might do
If every nigga hated him, for that Black Bitch track
And niggas stopped bumpin' Dre after Dee Barnes got slapped
When Doc say, ""It's a wrap"", it's a wrap,
It's still Aftermath, and ain't nothing after that"

You got me talkin' like a baby
Sophisticated

I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you, and uh

Nas	9	Who Killed It?	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Verse 1]	"Look here see, Pretty Mike shanked Two-Face Al over some gal
Found the body dead in the isles
Death by strangulation, microphone cord, a dirty broad
Guess they'll never play it again Sam
Damn that was my jam, now she's on the lam
She made it out with 200 grand, what a scam
While these two compete on who's the star of the show
Golden legs there makes off with the dough
I read the paper there with Joe the Butcher
""He said one glance is all it took ya, she's a real looker
They say her old mans a bootlegger
Transporting in any weather and at this rate we'll never get her""
Fellas, think it's time to call it a night
All this talk of this mystery dame's getting me tight
Thought I saw her in my eyesight, right
Hate to spoil the party, ""What are you guys havin', the same?
Waiter another round for the gang""
It's strange how I always felt outta place
Joe the Butcher's my ace, but in comes Freckle Face
So I said ""See you later.""
'Fore I hurt him and his two ugly thumb breakers
He met them in Louisiana wrestling gators
An idiot can tell they're involved with the caper
So I pulled the revolver on my waist up
Between the patrol car and the gray truck
Behind the street lamp was a silhouette
White gloves and a real long cigarette
What do you know all this time she's got me in her scope
She spoke, says, ""The devil got you guys by the throat
Your conspiracy theories won't work without evidence
That's the reason why Eric B. is not president"""

Infamous Mobb bosses, check out the portrait
At the round table, my Dunn speaking with his Twin ghost
It's gangster how we rock, while you watch
Attracted to our style, this is how we get down
With big jewelry and big guns
We get busy, it get grizzly, beat niggas bloody

Gang Starr	21	Robbin Hood Theory	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 2]	"I floss my rhymes like dentals, my mental's presidential
From the wild ghetto districts to the plush residential
Essential, would be the message that I send you
I meant to, elevate at every venue
Pops told me to pursue what is true, and nothing other
And nowadays I pave the way for troops of my young brothers
Necessary by all means, sort of like Malcolm
Before it's too late; I create, the best outcome
So I take this opportunity, yes to ruin the
Devilish forces fucking up my black community
And we ain't doing no more interviews
Til we get paid out the frame, like motherfucking Donahue
We're taking over radio, and wack media
Cause systematically they getting greedier and greedier
Conquering turfs with my ill organization
Takin out the man while we scan the information
You wanna rhyme you best await son
You can't even come near, if you ain't got our share
You front on us this year, consider yourself blown out of here
Yeah... by my Robin Hood Theory"

I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
That means I end up burnin' in Hell, scorchin' in flame
That means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
'Cause right now, I feel like I've just hit the rock bottom
I've got problems, now everybody on my block's got 'em (Duh)
I'm screamin' like them two cops when 2Pac shot 'em
Holdin' two Glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunt 'em
I could be takin' 'em to shops to pawn 'em
I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch, you want 'em?

Overdosage, imperial pistols ferocious
Fuck a bitch, don't tease, bitch, striptease, bitch
Eat a bowl of these, bitch, gobble a dick
Hoes forgot to eat a dick and shut the fuck up (Fuck up, bitch)
Gobble and swallow a nut up, shut up and get my cash (Cash)
Backhanded, pimp-slapped backwards and left stranded
Just pop your collar, pimp convention, hoes for a dollar
Six-Deuce in a plush, six-deuce Impala
Pimping hoes from Texas to Guatemala
Bitch niggas pay for hoes (Hoes) just to lay with hoes (Hoes)
Relax one night and pay to stay with hoes (Hoes)

You into hitting bitches off with a grip, you punk bitch"
Havoc	7	Up North Trip	The Infamous	1995	[Verse 2]	"You tried to dip, duck, but still got bucked
You talk too much shit, you shoulda kept your mouth shut
All that gossip, motherfucker, don't you know my Glock kicks
Hollow tips, to your body, mad toxic?
I fade you, blow you with a rusty-ass razor
Did you a favor, tried to wet you but I graze you
Pop goes the Glock when there's beef on the block
Chill for a while, make them think the beef stop
Then I creep like a thief in the night, it's only right
Ain't no turnin' back, it's on tonight
And if I get caught, then my ass is up north
Straight on a course for Upstate New York
Stressed, smokin' back to back cigarettes
In pop', dawg, on-point in the mess hall
But to avoid that, from head-to-toe dipped in all-black
Hit them niggas where they pump they cracks at
Havoc, with the murder master plan
Keep my 9 up to par so my shit won't jam
God forbid if my shit do
Run behind a tree, fix my shit then hit you
Slugs in your body, mainly in your brain tissue
Ditch from the scene, get ghost, stash the pistol
So simple, then watch my back, lay up and relax
Roll a sack K-A, black, find a shorty to tap"
Rakim	10	Waiting for the World to End	The Master	1999	[Verse 3]	"Shorty was taught to keep his head to the sky, and never cry
But the streets left him to die, now it's death in his eye
Livin' in sin'll give men a sinister grin
From the beginnin' to end, in it to win
Evil rebels, doin' what we do in the ghetto
Thinkin' if we was thorough we could deceive the devil
You can't win, your life'll end, try again
Shorty said, ""Why we born again to die again?""
That's what I said when I realized I had a gift
To uplift and be one of Allah's advocates
Teach the youth and speak the truth
Show 'em what peace can do when they'll reach for you
And my reward won't be jewels or cheese, it's even better
I can be one of the greatest MC's ever
If I tell 'em they intelligent women and great men
And live, stop waitin' for the world to end"

The Game	13	Too Much	Doctor’s Advocate	2006	[Verse 3]	"Drive fast, both hands on the dash
Close both of your eyes and hope that you don't crash
It's lyrical homicide, both airbags out
Roll the fuckin' windows down, let the bass out
Niggas, drop the top on whatever you in
Bitches, let your ponytail blow in the wind
Inhale the chronic, blow out dollar signs
Nigga you can drive a Bentley if only in your mind
Four doors, leather and wood
Ride like I got a horse stable under my hood
And I keep a chrome .4-5 under my hood
So if I die, nigga bury me under my hood
Who had the hottest bitch in the game, wearin' they chain
Mr. H to the Izzo, Nas and Hurricane
Long as my family straight, read this at my wake
I gave 'em The Documentary and they scraped the plate
Twenty magazine covers, nigga look at his face
I cannot, will not ever be replaced
Cause I'm the ice cream truck man, guns in the trunk man
Drugs in the trunk man, call me the front man"
André 3000	27	She’s Alive	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Chorus]	"A boy to raise at a young age

I would say I'm the realest nigga rappin'

Can I get a ""Amen"" from the congregation?

Dr. Dre	1	Deeez Nuuuts	The Chronic	1992	[Verse 1]	"Back with some shit that gots to bump
As you pull up in the park, you pops your trunk
Just to floss it like a motherfucker, clownin' and shit
Got your Dana's on your hooptie and your fly-ass bitch
Throw off, go off, show off, I take that ho
If she proper, I'ma pop her, the ho hopper
Is back on track
With big money, big nuts and a big fat chronic sack"
Lupe Fiasco	23	MS. MURAL	DRILL MUSIC IN ZION	2022	[Verse 1]	"""If you had to paint the gutter, which color would you choose?""
Said the patron to the painter, the painter said, ""The blues""
""Do you act off intuition or languish and peruse?""
""More like tap into tradition from the angle of my mood""
He looked back at his canvas while strangling a tube
A master of the palette, all sanguine and cool
The music mostly jazz, the jazz mostly old
Punctured by some punk and some old smoky soul
An atlas on the trunk from the land of broken goals
Just a cover and a back that you open and you close
""Where are all the pages?"" The paintеr said, defanged
""I ripped 'еm all out and made some paper planes
Fish grease absorbers and some origami cranes”
Poured hisself a drink and then poured it down the drain
Looked at the empty canvas, said ""I think I have a name
I'll call it 'Gasoline Pouring on the Flames,'"" hah, hah"
Kendrick Lamar	16	The Heart Part 5	Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers	2022	[Verse 1]	"I come from a generation of pain, where murder is minor
Rebellious and Margielas'll chip you for designer
Belt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence
Make the wrong turn, be it will or the wheel alignment
Residue burned, mist of the inner-city
Miscommunication to keep homi' detective busy
No protection is risky
Desensitized, I vandalized pain, covered up and camouflaged
Get used to hearin' arsenal rain
Analyze, risk your life, take the charge
Homies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard
That's culture
Twenty-three hour lockdown, then somebody called
Said your lil' nephew was shot down, the culture's involved
I done seen niggas do seventeen, hit the halfway house
Get out and get his brains blown out, lookin' to buy some weed
Car wash is played out, new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed
A brand-new victim'll shatter those dreams
The culture"

Didn't have to break a steering column, didn't have to cook a rock
A damn goodie two-shoes, that what they call you (Ugh)
Never judge a person or a book by its covers (Yeah)
Just because my tone is darker than yours, a little tanner
You never took the time out, examine yourself, boy
Are you Black, white, Asian?
Indonesian or Borean—that's Black and Korean
We on the same team if we breathing
I jumped off the subject to see if you was seeing
That we drop a little science off in every verse
They put that P.A. sticker on it 'cause they scared we gon' curse
But the knowledge is the power (Power)
The cowards get devoured
Any hour, any cipher, any way to any height (Ugh)
Because I might just snap on a fuck-ass nigga (Bitch)
Might clap a cap at a sucker-ass nigga
In the meantime, Daddy Fat Sax gon' chill out
He might just pull out his pistol
And let that thing whistle at your windshield or your residence
Superman to Clark Kents, you better be way harder
Than the park bench to start this
Marcus, Jason, my little brother James—
All my brothers from my mama, but Andre is just the same (Ooh)
Ain't no, ""Uno,"" we a duo, deuce, dos, two, a pair
A player stiffen the competition
Pressed like Levi's and Tuffskins
One minus one, negative one minus negative one is nothing (Ugh)
Busting D-boy raps and player poems

Run an illegal business, racketeering
Smuggling, doin things from handin a gun,is what they fearin
Bodyguards and hitmen like some Al Capone shit
Heavy artillery got the cops on my dick
Different locations, spots where it takes place
If you short on my money, your ass is gettin filleted
There's four major gangs that run the city of G's
The violators, the Gambinos and the Corleones and me
The violators and Gambinos they run uptown
Me and my cousin Corleone, we run downtown
Murder's an everyday thang in the city
Where you gotta clock chips, jack robberies, and doin' this
Ten-eighty and eight, the charge of the weapons
Hit from verandas and do a thing unexpected
So we plan a plot with an Uzi and 10 shot
Buck em 'till they all drop, circle round the block
Let 'em have it as soon as they come out
Unload on their ass, commence to takin' 'em out!"

Put me inside a casket, you dirty bastards
Until the day I die, you catch a nigga high off weed, the police can't find me
My shit'll drop and I'll sell five million
While all the niggas enter the game, they caught up in this drug dealing
Now how can I fall? How can I ball?
How can I catch my enemies and murder 'em all?
My words of flame, burnin' niggas inside their brain
Niggas can't hang with me and nothing's changin', uh
Scarface got me on this shit
We lace heat, motherfuckers in their body and face, uh
Growing quicker, liquor, made me your daddy your nigga
Niggas don't wanna see me worldwide, mob figure

You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin'
With all the rest of the motherfuckers underachievin'
Man, this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow

So at the party, Ren is controllin' the floor
That you step and do your dance routine
It ain't a dream my man, you're in a gangsta scene
With a villain doin damage on a 24 track
With no confusion to finish my conclusion
Rythymatic rhymes from a radio cat
You can't take what I got coz I'll be takin it right back
Ruthless gangsta - Cold killin'
You wanna know what it's means? (Definition: villain!)
With the stupid dope rhyme
So once you hear one line you can tell it's mine
With a baseball cap that's black that I'm wearin'
And a look that keeps you all starin'
And wondering why I'm invincible
But when you hear my rhyme, it's convincible
I don't take no shorts while I'm constructing the ground
That makes y'all move around to my hell of a sound
Girls drool on me like a diamond
(Yo Ren, tell them what they do when you start rhymin')
I go to the party, I hip, I hop the spot
I dunno what it is, but the girls get hot
Perspirin' like they're on fire and
Their so-called boyfriends with'em are retirin'
And for this reason I'm a walkin threat
So when I'm on stage I want quiet on tha set

But I never had no problem with alcohol

I miss the couch and down I go, lookin' like a bouncy ball
Shit must've knocked me out 'cause I ain't feel the ground at all

I'm leaving authors and writers with arthritis
You got the slightest ideas, I got the brightest
Here's the lightest, so clear, it's out of sight, it's
Dark, but from the darkness, came the light
The night is the time for Ra to recite it
Educated, but complicated style
For all the biters, I'm shutting rappers up like Midas
I got the force of a Turbo Porsche
You get lost in the source and then thrown off course
You can't destroy the decoy's to detour
No sense of direction so what's your speed for
You wouldn't have never made it, how many styles have I created
So many rhymes I bust, you're frustrated
Then the mic will self-destruct, you'll get sprayed
Pass the hand grenade"
Rakim	10	Remember That	The 18th Letter	1997	[Verse 3]	"Open the door, let the crowds in, over twenty thousand
Wildin', music's loud and microphone's growlin'
Tickets are sold out, parties is packed and
On tour, rippin' basketball arenas back then
Even afterparties, posses of players and hotties
Everybody was Gotti, spreadin' bucks like shotties
Spendin' cash, to make a good time last
Thoughts that I had give me a blast of the past
Memories of unforgettable times on my mind
Dollar signs and melodies and incredible rhymes
The people I met and the sets that got wrecked
All the mics I checked, most of all life's effects
And peace to all the people I grew up around
In the streets, back when beats had a rougher sound
I used to be wild, me and my crew sit back and we smile
Keep piles of pictures filed in case I go senile
'Cause some things are just too good to be forgot
Like your neighborhood block or your favorite spot
Certain records always seem to make me reminisce
And when it hits, and then it clicks, remember this?
My life flash before me, I'm there from the sounds I hear
Pinpoint the year, it's perfectly clear
I like the way it went down and all of that
In fact, it mean a lot 'cause you can't bring it back, remember that"

Kendrick Lamar	16	Worldwide Steppers	Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers	2022	[Verse 1]	"I am not for the faint of heart
My genetic build can build multi-universes, the man of God
Playin' ""Baby Shark"" with my daughter
Watchin' for sharks outside at the same time
Life as a protective father, I'd kill for her
My son Enoch is the part two
When I expire, my children'll make higher valleys
In this present moment, I saw that through
Ask Whitney about my lust addiction
Text messagin' bitches got my thumbs hurt
Set precedent for a new sacrilegion
Writer's block for two years, nothin' moved me
Asked God to speak through me, that's what you hearin' now
The voice of yours truly
Teleport out my own body for comfort
I don't pass judgment, past life regressions keep me in question
Where did I come from? I don't think like I used to
No, I don't blink like I used to
Awkward stares at everybody, see the flesh of man
But still, this man compared to nobody
Yesterday, I prayed to the flowers and trees
Gratification to the powers that be
Synchronization with my energy chakras, the ghost of Dr. Sebi
Paid it forward, cleaned out my toxins, bacteria heavy
Sciatica nerve pinch, I don't know how to feel
Like the first time I fucked a white bitch"

I'm the rapper with clout other niggas yap about
You know the one that introduce New York to the beach cruiser
Got 'em puttin red and blue strings in they G-Units
Get ""Groupie Love,"" tell 'em to keep movin
If I got a problem with a bitch I let Eve do it
Unless she got on LePearla and I can see through it
I don't just let her ride, I give her the keys to it
Me and my bitch lay back in the Coupe
I'm movin in the neighborhood, I ain't passin through
I woulda been here after Snoop, but I slowed down
To show Timbaland how to iron a khaki suit"

Breeze through melodies cause it's been a long time
My lyrics is fury and rappers hate to hear me rhyme
Every antidote that I quote, is no joke
Nobody's smilin in the ghetto from the notes I wrote
My high techniques wreck and disrespect beats
Have you follow-in the leader up and down the streets
So kick along as I rip a song with pull
As the rhyme goes on I get paid in full
It's Rakim, I'm indicating rhymes for the showing
Check it out y'all, I keep it goin when I'm flowing"

Picasso with a pick-axe, a sick asshole
Tic-tac-toe 'cross your six-pack with X-acto
Knives, stranglin' wives with thick lasso
Big bags of the grass, Zig-Zags, I'm with the Doc, so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison to boys and girls who do not know
You do not wanna try this at home, my lil' vato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a six-pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn and watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected, nor what you thought, so
'Bout time that you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke"

You talk but you scared to go back up North
Keep your face twisted, but you don't really want nothin'
Talk a bunch of shit, motherfucker, and stop frontin'
You don't wanna flip again, and sell drugs again
Be on the run again, catch you at the Comfort Inn
Shoot up your door, bust in on you and your whore
Put y'all in bags, clean the blood off of the floor
So play tough, I want y'all to get outta line
I got .9's — every color, shape and design
I sent killers of every race to put one in your spine
Two in your ear, get your crew, who do I fear?
Nobody never gettin' rob and none of us dyin'
I think like you do, roll with about two irons
Catch me flyin' high in the aircraft, winin' and dinin'
You die? Then we laugh, you bitch-ass
The rich ass, they gauze up, your stab wounds
While I'm gettin' head in a Lear jet bathroom
With all my goons, all my ices, suitcases
Full of paper, not money, it's bank statements
We Illmatic — that explains how we rock
Yachts and co-ops, we buy the hood and sell you a block"

CCF sponsoring, world conquering, telephone monitoring
Louis Vuitton modeling, pornographic actress honoring
String theory pondering, bulimic vomiting
Catholic Priest fondling, preemptive bombing
And Osama and Obama 'nem

Hennessy and Hypnotiq swallowing

'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated"

So I take time out my day
To pray and I say, now lay me down to sleep
Hopin' that I keep my soul
Peep, I'm gettin' old and this a cold, cold world
And I ain't even got a bomber
Livin' with my momma, it's the same routine
Keep my room clean, I'm lookin' to do some new things
But ain't shit to do
I'm twenty-two, catch
In the prime of my life, I have no time for a wife
I funnel through the tunnel, disgruntled
Tryin' to find me some light
In the rim of darkness, I too sing
I may not be the darkest, brother
But I was always told to act my age, not my color
Not knowin' that my color, was out of the original
So now I sing the new negro spiritual
It goes, 'get up, stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up, stand up
Don't give up the fight
It's like, how can you understand the pain
When you never had to stand under the rain?
When it rains, it pours
And it's about to come down hard, thank God
I found you"
Prodigy	8	Nighttime Vultures	Hell On Earth	1996	[Verse 1]	"Yo, I rose early mornin', spread my wings, yawnin'
Vague memory of last night, now it's all dawnin'
Looked down and see dried blood on all my garment
It stained on my Guess formers, kevlared enormous
I hopped up outta my bed holdin' my head
Flashbacks of gunshots shot past my head
I can recall an eight-man brawl, three men fall
Bullets flew, had to drug my man behind the wall
Left a wet trail, delivered these slugs like air mail
Directly at the cat that made my man blood spill
An eye for an eye, you know my science of life
Is you man or mice, thugs or the cowardly type?
I kick that '98 shit for your ears to list'
Nigga, P way ahead of his time, surpassed kids
(Fuck them kids be doin', yo?)
Kickin' rhymes that's true lies
Let me break 'em down to size, minimize they airtime
After this, you never will go back to that which
Sit back and write half-ass shit
The last official, taking out the artificial
Let me relieve you, replace that shit with some lethal
Mobb, remember the name, it's been along
Got niggas shook to death from the first fuckin' song
Fluidly, my mind flooded with jewels infinite
The chronic rap bandits, the addicts stuck on some live shit
Bear witness to this diligent street cat
I carry myself, hold myself down in fact
This one dedicated to my niggas on run
Holdin' big gats, go for your gun
Prepare to crush one, we trust none
Man who ain't down with the clan
The Mobb dynasty, apparently, you thought I was some other type
Nigga you could fuck with, you shit outta luck, boss
I break your compass, throw you way off course
We built this from ground up, started from ground zero
Mafia Onda, see the name up on the mural
Durable, physically fit, raps articulate
You get your whole skeleton cracked somethin' ridiculous
And still facinated by my stee'

You got a appetite for hollow-tips, I feed you my gun
This is that Ferrari F-50 shit, it's real laid back
Type shit you recline to in the Maybach
I got two shooters now on the run from the fuzz
You get the same shit for ten bodies you get from one cuz
I live life in the fast lane; hundred miles an hour
Chrome and some wood grain
You know a nigga still really tryin to move 'caine
Make a little extra money on the side mayne, I ain't playing
I'm up early with the birds, word, putting that work in
Pirellis on the Porsche chirping, I'm making moves
I got a hundred mil from music, a hundred grand from crack

Just as well, cause in my cell I'm keepin' pictures of these bastards
Exercisin', visualizin', everyone inside a casket
Picture me blasted, surrounded by niggas in masks
Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass
Will I last? Heaven or Hell? Freedom or jail?
Shit's hard, who can you tell? And if we fail?
High speeds, and Thai weed on the freeway
When will they learn to take it easy? Uh
Drive-by's and niggas die, murder without a motive
By makin' motherfuckers fry
Got me runnin' from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops
Helicopters tryna hover over niggas 'til we drop
Got no time for the court, my only thought is open fire
Hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, cause she's a liar
Now it's time to expire, I see the judge, spray the bitch
""Motherfuckers is crooked,"" is what I scream, and hit the fence
I commence to get wicked, spittin' rounds as the plot thickens
Never missin', an early grave is my only mission
If I die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five

I got a Glock that say 'Pac run the block
Fuck the cops 'cause my gauge gets me— paid!
As I sit and reminisce about the old days
Hugging on my AK, fuck getting played, hey
I say niggas need to get they mind right
Until they do I pop a clip and grip my nine tight

In the past, I mainly hustled for the cash
Surprised to see Dat Nigga rise up on dat ass
Anybody killa, do or die if I have to
On deck 24/7 and blastin' if I have to
I live my life by the sword accordin' to the law
Before I stopped to wonder why the journey's so far
From the danger that lurks, from the one that's out doin' dirt
Step to mine and find yourself vanish away from this Earth
Beyond the heartbreaks and heartaches, rest in peace
Ride or die, death is unexplainable when you die"

Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
Yes, he was still fresh-to-death
Bling, two earrings, a chain layin' on his chest
He still had it 'cause they couldn't find it
And the bullets from his enemies sat, like, two inches behind it
Smelled the Hennessy from when his niggas got reminded
And poured out liquor in his memory; he didn't mind it, but—
He couldn't sip it fast enough
So, the liquor was just fillin' the casket up
Floatin' down by his feet was the letter from his sister
Second-grade handwriting simply read, ""I miss ya""
Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughter's picture
Right next to it, one of his mans stuck a Swisher
He had a notion as he laid there soakin'
He saw that the latch was broken, he kicked his casket open

But why would I get a chip on my shoulder?
I was considered, one time, as the illest
Bitch, I'm still as fly as your zipper
True, I just get richer
But if it was ever all about skrilla
Then I woulda quit a long motherfucking time ago
Bitch, shut the fuck up
I should go say that shit to Tech N9ne or to Jigga
Nobody said shit about 2 Chainz as long as he's been here, shit
No wonder you're mad, now I'm
Looking at them plaques, count 'em (Yeah)
I'm LL Cool J, Bigger and Deffer, that's how come (Uh)
I sell like four mil' when I put out a bad album (What?)
Revival flopped, came back and I scared the crap out 'em
But Rolling Stone stars, I get two and a half outta
Five, and I'll laugh out loud
'Cause that's what they gave BAD back in the day
Which actually made me not feel as bad now, 'cause
If it happened to James
It can happen to Shady

Once I was played in rotation
At every radio station
They said I'm lyrically amazing
But I have nothing to say
But then when I put out Revival and I had something to say
They said that they hated the awake me
I lose the rage, I'm too tame
I get it back, they say I'm too angry
I need to get me some Dre beats
No, I should hook up with Tay Keith
Fans keep on pulling me one way
Haters pull me in another
Got more hooks in me than Swae Lee
'Bout to pick up some weights and lift 'til my tattoo of Hailie's face stretches
They said I'm just a whiner, I sound like a baby
I dish it out but can't take it
But I take it, dish it back out
And they get all bent out of shape
This shit's almost comical
Wait, and I meant no disrespect
I wasn't dissin' Tech, that was not a shot at 2 Chainz or to Jay-Z
They probably feel the same way because lately
Instead of us being credited for longevity
And being able to keep it up for this long at this level, we
Get told we'll never be what we were
Bitch, if I was as half as good as I was
I'm still twice as good as you'll ever be
Only way that you're ahead of me's alphabetically

It's your funeral, prepare to die

I switch the flow so quick, you cannot fathom
I take a submarine two thousand leagues below the sea

And your team looking shitty to death"

Good Morning Viet-Com, I'm back
Huh, it's me again
Is it me you're looking for? (Yup)
For the perfect beat, sweetly oblique
I'm fresh, I come clean, but I can't whistle
Psss, I'm only buggin
While No dug in the crates, I dug in my nose
And picked a rhyme, any rhyme I don't have any time
To waste, I'm hip... don't even trip
To an easy travel agent now we fly for free
I can be fly for free
You want some fire tree, then buy from me
I got the flame like U-I-C but I be from U-A-C
Some of the realest illest chillest cats you may see
In your life if you get one
Rappers are like jobs to me (Why?) because they get done
Here it comes I'm as Able as Cain to get raw
That's why the DJ's mix me, I'm gonna bust dicks
This is not da bomb so save all your threats
I'm good to go and also I'm Rets
Rhymes I wrecks affects the roughnecks
Down to the preps in the Polos, the studs with fros
Hoes with weaves, the bald-headed to the dreaded
To folks with butters, high rollers in rollers
Players with plats, studs with stocking caps
I be rockin' raps 'til I collapse
Niggas play my tape about as much as they do craps
I'm on point, I cee-lo, I see high
Hi C, I'm free at last
I'm a free man, free as World B
And like an early bird, I'm special
You ain't that special, as Ed and Vesta
So to myself I say congratulations
I'm glad you had the patience, you better have the patience
'Cause this is me"

To heal steel, medical bill drill harmonics
Silver sonnets from the ""bonne nuits"" and bonnets
I leave a whole sleeve down in Condoleezza's comments
Copper ebonics, competent and gannet
Godzilla's economics rock gondolas 'til you vomit
Bigger than the tongue and write signatures with a Thomas
Great Wall of China climber and Bonnie Woo correspondent
Opera onyx, popular's for convicts
Stay below the doppler, turn Robotniks into Sonics
Positioned jostlers, monitor hegemonics
Robots make the robots that solder thе electronics
Nostradamus couldn't bother to keep a promisе
Logic's on the rocket, what profit defeats a conscience?
Somebody's daughter is contemplating the convent
But a man with a dollar is slobbering for her haunches
Mouth is just watering for some nonsense
And this might be the moment her modeling probably launches
Gobbling collard greens through the rumpus
Washing gasoline, watch hollering, replace a congress
Golden gossiping auditing through my content
Running out of water, just pondering where the pond went
World's hottest summer, we're wondering if they pawned it
Desperate for the credits to come tumbling through the conflict, yeah"

Now that you're gone, it hit us
Super hard on Thanksgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yo, you heard the track I did, man? ""This Can't Be Life""
Somebody please say grace, so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it, why the guard had to look all through it?
As kids, we used to laugh, who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, you tell me you ain't did it, then you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business"

You's a college girl, but that don't stop you from doin'
Come and see the Dogg in a hood near you, and
You don't ask why I roll with a crew, and
Twist up my fingers, and wear dark blue, and

Prodigy	8	Up North Trip	The Infamous	1995	[Verse 1]	"It all began on the street, to the back of a blue police vehicle
Next come the bookings, the way things is lookin'
It's Friday, you in for a long stay
Gettin' shackled on the bus first thing come Monday
Hopin' in your mind you'll be released one day
But knowin', home is a place you're not goin' for a long while
Now you're up on the Isle
And the position that you in got you refusin' to smile
But keep in mind, there's a brighter day, after your time spent
Used to be wild, but locked up, you can't get bent
Thought you could hack it, now you're requestin' PC
You fragile, it ain't hard to see
Niggas like that don't associate with me
I'd rather, get busy to the third degree
'Cause the war in population's on infinitely
If this was the street, my razor would be a MAC demon
Hit you up, leave your whole face screamin'
What you in for, kid? Bustin' nuts?
Cats heard of me in street stories caught inside this trap
Who are you to look at me with your eyes like that?
Wisen up, young blood, before you make things escalate
And I would hate to set your crooked ass straight"

Listen to the words, take it as a jewel
If I'm fuckin your 'burb, just maintain cool
Cause I won't take a L, whether in your crib or the outside world
Cause the pound clap well, like fan mail
Choose to ignore me, the warning that I gave 'em
Get at me, you and what army?
The fashion-ass niggas you hang with, have a plate of graveshift
Man down, nigga it's the same shit

They tryin' to get that paper just like Uncle Sam
And just like Sam niggas just don't give a damn
They mission is to leave yo' ass in pain
Cause they don't give a fuck about a thing
It's a cold game, that's how they talkin' if they walk on the West
Better watch yourself without this star protectin' your chest
These niggas come from nowhere, get to takin' yo' shit
You'll get beat outside the set and then sent home in your stretch
This shit is a mess..
You can't walk in them streets unless you walk with your vest
You can't talk to police cause most police ain't gon' stress

Different color coupes but I'm in love with the black one
On point, cause you get R.I.P.'s when slacking
So the stash box big enough to squeeze the MAC in, yeah
I'm fairly new but I demand some respect
Cause I already wear your advance on my neck
I'm fresh off the jet, then I breeze to the beaches
Blue Yankee fitted, G-Unit sneakers
I already figured out what to do with all my features
Decorate the basement, full of street sweepers
When it comes to stunting there's nothing you could teach us
We're in a different time zone, your records don't reach us, nah
I ain't here to save the world, just roll up a blunt

Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're
Right back on it, reminding me all over again how you fuckin' just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryna soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed
For the way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over?
You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine
Well, I've never recovered
But tonight, bet you that what you're
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, ""Let it go, fuck this!""
Heart's saying, ""I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"""

Mac-10s, you can smell the PCP smoke
Melle Mel told it real, in the music he wrote
Those were the days I remember, we used to be close
Then I was nine, coldest winter I remember
Was slipping in December, two feet of snow
Yeah, that's the East Coast, that black ice
Symbolize the rap life, it was slick and smooth
I understood I had to come from the hood
Doing the Pee Wee Herman, the Smurf
Before them phones chirped
The block's drugs flowing, didn't have your own work
You had to have somebody else's, a small chrome on your pelvis
Starter jacket, Blue Georgetown or Green Celtic
Your girl's too expensive, she want shellfish
Red Lobster was popping, standing on that line forever
I wish somebody would step on my Bally leathers
Now it's whatever
Hip Hop's forever
Kept my radio on 98 or BLS
Had a pre-pubescent lyric gift, but niggas never hear me spit
My little brother tried to warn them, I was a tornado coming
He knew from inside like the eye of a storm, and told my pops about it
He gave us tickets to that Wild Style flick
Double Trouble retarded, we was the proudest
I never had a summer job
Sweeping leaves, socks to my knees
Home-made shorts, cut off Lee's
I ain't work a day in my life
Wiping away eraser off the paper, man
I'm just trying to say it right
Big radio, tape's slowing down
Lower the lights go, battery dead
I got to freeze them 'till they're ice cold
In the freezer later, I'm staring at the speaker
Sunk in them 808s deeper, cleaning my sneakers
With the bristles of a toothbrush, soap and water
I let the shoestrings soak in water"

In a four-dash-six, bitch, you can go ask
So when I go fast, po-po just laugh
Right until I run out of gas or 'til I go crash
Whatever comes first, I'm prepared for the worst
Whatever comes second, I'll be there with my weapon
Pulling up in the Lexuses, one on both hand
So I guess them GS'ses was ambidextrous
Could've sworn her breast-eses was sending me messages
""K, I need a free hand-mammogram
I got weed, drink, and a Handicam
All of which is legal in Amsterdam""
So, say my name like Candyman
And I'ma come and fix you up like the handyman

Or the hoes I got - catching stunts in the drop
Now, Nas, he love the kids (haha), 50 on that killer shit

You niggas better make up a dance and try to get radio play
Keep on snapping your fingers, I ain't going away,,
I don't regret what I spit, 'cause I know what I say
And niggas talking about me, they don't know when to stop
I got the Louis Vuitton belt buckle holding the Glock
No beam, no silencer; I know when to pop
Wait 'til Lil Jon come on and let off a shot
I had the number-one Billboard spot
Niggas stepped on my fingers, and I climb right back to the top

Face down on the pavement with the billy clubs
Took that feeling to the studio and cued it up
And now it's ""Fuck the Police"" all up in the club
Now it's '91 and Snoop Dogg came to visit and was like
""What up cuz? Let me show you what this chronic like""
Couldn't help myself, just had to dip into that chronic life
And then that night came in when that nigga Knight came in
(Woo!) This one of those dreams you don't wake up from

You might learn something"

You never talk too much to get your spot blown
Now you're no longer just a face in the crowd
You're getting so much respect that niggas might as well bow
And moving up with your hustle like you planned it
Rakin' dough like the world's greatest bandit
Always got one eye open, for the stick-up kids posting
So much cream chumps they can't understand it
Ladies flock to your jock like it's golden
Curious, to test the weight you be holding
But you ain't got no time, to be chasing felines
If she's the chick that you pick then she gets chosen
People treat you like you're ghetto royalty
And all your staff shows you utmost loyalty
You've paid your dues, refuse to lose in this scenario
The rep grows bigger, you're a legend and a hero"

Nothin' but horses, kid
We go to war for this"

A woman's worth, I barely went to church, I'd rather fast with you
Than fuck it up, fucking with skirts 'cause I'm rational
A nigga still gon' be a nigga, emoji heart, my family pictures
Two-steppin' away from rappers, I don't trust their true intеntions
I'm not in the music business, I been in the human businеss
Whole life been social distant, hoes like when you not trippin'
I duck the party, who said they saw me?
Crown on Bob Marley, wrist on Yo Gotti
They gon' judge yo’ life for a couple likes on the double tap
Them hoes is sorry, they all get bodied
I bless it that you have an open heart, I bless that you forgive
I bless it that you can learn from a loss, I bless it that you heal
I bless one day that you attract somebody with your mind exact
A patient life, flaws, bless 'em twice, and they'll bless you back"
Kurupt	4	One By One	Dogg Food	1995	[Verse 4]	"I'm on another journey, my mind set on twistin' (Uh-huh)
Gettin' twisted and twist this fool for his grip, then dash
(What up?) Daz and the G set to chirp, strapped
Cuzzy don't give a fuck, and down to put in work
And this is how it's done like one-two-three
Kurupt, and I'm quick to fuck shit up on G.P
Lethal, there's no stoppin' me, top notch
There's no equal to the philosophies I concoct"

Eminem	15	Unaccommodating	Music to Be Murdered By	2020	[Verse 2]	"Game over, Thanos on you H-O's
On my petty shit but I don't paint toes (Yeah)
Get the plunger (Plunger) 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy
Call us liquid plumber, 'cause even Dre know (Dre know)
Beat knocks like a beefed up Detox
You're gonna need three squads of police officers at least to come pull me off of it and I don't stop
Please, dawg, I need y'all to keep talking shit 'cause I feed off of it
I am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars, I'ma leave carnage
Each thought'll be so toxic, it'll block the wind through your esophagus
Stop it, cutting off your oxygen
And I hit them pads like a boxing gym
Better watch for Slim, better get to popping and when I'm at the top again
I won't topple, I'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop
But when they ask me is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is
I cleansed him of his mortal sins, I'm God and the Lord forgives even the devil worshippers
I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone when you're born with Lucifer's horns
And you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube and The Poor Righteous Teachers tutored my students
Showed them all the blueprint and formula
But it seems like the more they studied my music, the more they remind me of eyeballs
I'm watching my pupils get cornier (Uh)
But I'm contemplating yelling ""Bombs away"" on the game
Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting"
Kanye West	5	Can’t Tell Me Nothing	Graduation	2007	[Chorus]	"La, la, la-la
Wait 'til I get my money right

Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing

Nas	9	Where Y’all At	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Verse 2]	"The ill whip pusher, my spit wet ya if you stand close to the woofer
Bet you get sprayed by my lecture
Any club with ladies or dimes, I'm a regular
Give it up smooth, I ain't begging ya
Intelligent brainiac, brains maniac
Back of the Maybach, taste that, don't waste that
Eat with my elbows top of the table
Street etiquette with speech impediments
And still see presidents, no matter who paid
'Cause you ain't take the last dollar made
Long as they keep printing it, there's chances of getting it
Money's my bitch, and we stay intimate
Ask about Nashwan, could ask about Jung'
Ask about Bravehearts and ask where I'm from
Q-Boro, specifically The Bridge
Don't ask no more questions, y'all know what it is"
Nas	9	One Time 4 Your Mind	Illmatic	1994	[Verse 2]	"What up, niggas? How y'all? It's Nasty, the villain
I'm still writin' rhymes, but besides that, I'm chillin'
I'm tryin' to get this money, God — you know the hard times, kid
Shit, cold, be starvin' make you wanna do crimes, kid
But I'ma lamp 'cause a crime couldn't beat a rhyme
Niggas catchin' 3-to-9's, Muslims yellin' ""Free the mind!""
And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places
As a kid, when I would say that outta town, niggas chased us
But now I know the time, got a older mind, plus control a .9
Fine, see, now I represent mine
I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me
Yet I'm a menace, yo, police wanna murder me
Heini Dark drinker, represent the thinker
My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers
Think I'll dim the lights, then inhale, it stimulates
Floatin' like I'm on the North 95 Interstate
Never plan to stop, when I write, my hand is hot
And expand the lot from the Wiz to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make your heads bop, pah
I shine a light on perpetrators like a cop's car
From day to night, I play the mic, and you'll thank God
I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job
My brain is incarcerated
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I've raided
I hold a MAC-11 and attack a reverend
I contact eleven L's and max in Heaven"
JAY-Z	6	MaNyfaCedGod	4:44	2017	[Verse 3]	"Yoncé, all on this mouth like liquor
Uh, that my nigga, uh, that my nigga
Over everything, each of our mood swings
Whenever attitudes change, like a mood ring
Ain't nothing like somebody that get ya, baby, I get ya
Let's go through this thing, come out stronger, the golden journey
Broken is better than new, that's kintsukuroi
You're fine china, I'm a bull and ball in a china shop
I promise to repair with gold each bowl I drop
Be grateful for whatever comes because each has been sent
From a guy from beyond, that's what Rumi say
""Never go to bed mad,"" that's what my Ummi say
It always took her less to say more
I always thought she was an angel, now I'm sure, sure"

Future	30	Type Shit	WE DON’T TRUST YOU	2024	[Chorus]	"I don't hang with rats, that's some new type shit (New type shit)
Get a nigga whacked on the news type shit
Sippin' drank and Actavis on some Screw type shit
Just a sad ho runnin' through the crew type shit
I got a bad bitch at home, voodoo type shit
Take down Meg Thee Stallions by the group type shit"
Prodigy	8	I Don’t Know, Officer	Get Rich Or Die Tryin’ Music From And Inspired By The Motion Picture	2005	[Chorus]	"Nah, nigga, I don't know, I don't know who got you

Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
I'm up all night, getting my money right
Until the blue and white (po-po! po-po! po-po!)

And I've still got my khakis creased
I'm still loc'n on these beats and keep a bad bitch on the streets
It's the S-N-double-O-P'n
Biggest dogg of 'em all, and youse a flea'n
And since I got time to drop it for you, I guess I must
And give it to you motherfuckers like Busta-Bust
I keep the heat on deck, but in God we trust
And can't none of y'all fuck with us
But you can run up on the G, but that's not thinkin' wisely
These thrillers are ""Contagious"", just like Ron Isley

Gold bathtubs, making love to my Queen
Get my back rubbed, Chardonnay, rolling up green
Statues, marble floors, rare paintings on my wall
My lifestyle's like the Forbes Magazine
Closets, full of rockets and sub-machines
Take this nigga out the projects, and his thug team
Yo we cruise past street lights, ill rides
Mr. Chow both coasts with the most loud toast
Calicos roast y'all folks, keep y'all dying
'Cause it's hard to fuck around when we dealing with science
My enemies got money, so y'all should watch how I play it
They never know we enemies until they hear me say it
Til they kid's on the phone saying, ""Please daddy pay it""
Til they brain's on the floor, mixed on the pavement
High-class elegance, you respect or you hiss
You go against you'd rather piss on an electrical fence
It's strategic, how these niggas want you to think
You'd be surprised, who'd be the one to put you to sleep
Why you stink? Yo these streets don't allow you to blink
You get showered by lead, coming out with your mink
Bow ties and tuxedos, bust Eagles
Dump drugs and acid, then they rush with the Rico
It's hard fucking with niggas you hope you can trust
You a fool if your main bitch is easy to fuck
And you've got money - is these hoes greedy or what?
Shit is devious, ex-friends wanting you stuck"

Havoc	7	Clap	Infamy	2001	[Verse 1]	"Yo
Some niggas need the henny to endure the drama
All I need is information on your crib and armor
When it comes to creepin niggas know that I'm the father
Need guns get your own gats and never charter
Like a fucked up barber I push your wig farther
Pull strings have you gettin clapped and things
My gat is freaky to lick more than any shorty's tongue ring
Any nigga threatenin my life's a done deal
Watch the bitch get revealed then she snitch and squeal
Blow a nigga have em leakin to the court of appeal
Searchin for Hav is like a search through fog
How you like to make a last pit stop at the morgue
Niggas wanna spread they wings then I'm clippin em off
Niggas wanna spread rumors I'll shoot their mouth off (uh-huh uh-huh)
And clap a bastard in the first degree (uh-huh uh-huh)"

Here's a sip for the crew that's deceased
If I get revenge, then they rest in peace
Somebody gotta suffer, I just might spare one
And give a brother a fair one
Stay alert and on P's
And I do work with these like Hercules
Switch to southpaw, split your right jaw
'Cause I don't like y'all, I'm hype when night fall
Smooth, but I move like an army
Bulletproof down in case brothers try to bomb me
Puttin' brothers to rest like Eliot Ness
'Cause I don't like stress
Streets ain't the place for innocent bystanders to stand
Nothing's gonna stop the plan
I'll chill like Pacino, kill like De Niro
Black Gambino, die like a hero
Livin' on shaky grounds, too close to the edge
Let's see if I know the ledge"
Nas	9	Hip Hop Is Dead	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Chorus]	"If hip hop should die before I wake

Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ

I'm cool as a light breeze, I'm playin' rappers out like striped Lees
I'm smoother than velvet, my lyrics are well-writ
You sayin', ""L's this,"" and, ""L's that""—get off L' dick
I don't roll with punks I only roll with live guys
And we do drivebys in 325is
I had beef with this thief named Randolph
Now he's in a casket dressed up with his hands crossed
So you better leave L alone
Before I reach out and touch you but not with a telephone
Yo I'm the brother that you never even thought of beatin'
Black white or Puerto Rican, I'm gonna slaughter each and
Every crab MC that runs up
When a battle comes up, give me two thumbs up"

If you look closely, 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go, both coasts with toast

Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see a OG
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down"

Homie this is Thug Life nigga and we all strapped

Lupe Fiasco	23	KIOSK	DRILL MUSIC IN ZION	2022	[Verse 3]	"Diamonds only worth what you are willing to pay
A deceptive game you are killing to play
Now I have diamonds, it's odd feeling this way
But when they start to sparkle that star-glittering glaze
It sways, takes your mind off todays
Where preachers can praise AIDS as God killing the gays
What a fucking phrase, never ceases to amaze
But when he dies from cancer, that's God's mysterious ways
Jesus saves African sold slaves
Gabriel's in Afghanistan passing out AKs
It's a rage
The diamond sometimes are suedes while putting 'em to the blade
I have hesitations
There, I've put it all on the table, I have my reservations
Besides, we'll find something else useless to put our faith in
You won't finish this here, we'll pick up after meditation, uh-huh
Uh-huh

I want a ghetto brunette with unforgettable sex
Now lay your head on my chest and feel my heartbeat
We can park the Jeep, pump Mobb Deep and just spark the leaf
It's hard to creep since I found Joe
Every pretty, round, brown ho wanna go down low
But this Boogie Down professional, I'ma let you know
Once I put the blows, get your clothes, 'cause you got to go

Spit on models, R.Kelly, piss on the center fold
Ever since Doc showed me a billion in a envelope
Love Jimmy, fuck Interscope, I'm a don
Walk outside, naked, Cuban cigar and Louboutins, huh

You page me, when you got the day free
But I be out with my peeps in them system Jeeps
You wanna lay up in the sheets of presidential suites
Like I'll massage you while you massage me, mami
But can you hang with a young man who's doing his thang?
Speak up, I wanna know if you can keep up
Timberland boots for girls, with the tree stump
Baggy sweatsuits, mystery what's underneath them

'Cause we're living in the last times
They wanna go to war, more wars to come
But most of us fight more wars than one
Discrimination in the racial nation
While they destroy our strong foundation
Nature's balance is way off balance
They tip the scale, now it's no more silence
The hole in the ozone layer's outta control
But they wanna fight for more oil and gold
Unemployment, I got laid off
The streets is the last resorts to get paid off
For more, more mint, no dough for rent
I gotta shed blood to make a red cent
Maybe I should ask the president
Somebody get me the president
But he don't want to hear it, it's out of the question
'Cause in my section it's worse than recession
So I go to a rich neighborhood and play Robin Hood
Take from the bad and give to the good
First I go to Bensonhurst, steal a Benz, snatch a purse
Pick up my friends, that's when it gets worse
'Cause I need government and they need government
A lot of mint spent, now I gotta pay rent
Who makes the most dead presidents in the projects
You're gonna get robbed and wrecked
I parked up the block to plot on a kid that made a knot
Let's get him for all he got
I approached him slow like I was a basehead
Put the four-fifth to his face and said
You see those kids over there with the hoods
Walk to 'em real slow and give them the goods
First the gun and the dough and crush the jumbos
One false move and no one knows
'Cause I got a silencer to hush the bust
And I'm in a rush, so hush the fuss
Plus the poison you fed will no longer spread
You're good as dead, I'm a fill your head with lead
That's when I pushed him into his building
To murder him, but I remembered his children"

I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything
I know Compton, I know street shit,I know shit that's conscious
I know everything, I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes, and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's ornery
I know everything, the highs, the lows, the groupies, the junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded—well, that's God's decision
I know you know that line's for Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don’t gossip 'bout how it was distributed
I know how people work
I know the price of life, I'm knowin' how much it’s worth
I know what I know, and I know it well not to ever forget
Until I realized I didn’t know shit, the day I came home"

Lupe Fiasco	23	Baba Says Cool for Thought	Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool	2007	[Verse]	"They thought it was cool to burn crosses in your front lawn as they hung you from trees in your backyard
They thought it was cool to leave you thirsty and stranded, Katrina
He thought it was cool to carry a gun in his classroom and open fire, Virginia Tech, Columbine, stop the violence
They thought it was cool to tear down the projects and put up million dollar condos, gentrification
They think it's cool to stand on the block hiding product in their socks making quick dime bag dollars
They think it's cool to ride down on you in blue and white and unmarked cars, busting you upside your head
Freeze
'Cause the problem is we think it's cool too
Check your ingredients before you overdose on The Cool"
Future	30	Rotation	DS2	2015	[Verse 2]	"Yeah, I fell asleep with that paper
Brooooo, I can't tell you 'bout no capers
I just took the middle man off
I go Corleone 'bout the check
I was getting dome with a Tech
Bitch, you ain't gon' get no extra points pulling no faggot move
I just called my contractor, told him ""build another pool""
One sitt in the back, one by the living room
I keep all my jewelry at the bank now
Alexander McQueen's therapeutic
Bitch, I'm getting the same money as Cam Newton
Ask me how it feel to be a millionare"
Eminem	15	My Name Is	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Verse 2]	"My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, ""Let's just be friends""
99 percent of my life, I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doin' drugs and name it after her
(Oh, thank you)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans
(Ahh, ahh, ahh)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it, ""Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"""
Prodigy	8	Crawlin	Infamy	2001	[Verse 4]	"Y'all some ho ass niggas, I'll slap days out you

Kanye West	5	Champion	Graduation	2007	[Verse 1]	"You don't see just how wild the crowd is?
You don't see just how fly my style is?
I don't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know, I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted layaway or a deposit
My dad'd say, ""When you see clothes, close your eyelids""
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie, I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'd get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school wit' a new wardrobe, but ayy"

Go ahead, act up, get smacked in the head with the burner (Ah)
I don't fight fair, I'm dirty, dirty
I'm from Southside Jamaica, Queens, nigga, you heard me? (Yeah)
When the streetlights come on, niggas blast the nines (Uh-huh)
Get locked up, then read books to pass the time (Woo)
In the game, there's ups and downs, so I stay on the grind
Niggas on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind
There ain't nothing they could do to stop my shine (Uh-uh)
This is God's plan, homie, this ain't mine
I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance
And Grandma always gotta throw in her two cents
I'm the dropout who made more money than his teachers
Roofless like the coupe, but I come with more features
I am what I am, you can like it or love it
It feels good to blow fifty grand and think nothing of it, fuck it"

Jay-Z	12	Bring It On	Reasonable Doubt	1996	[Verse 2]	"Mannerisms of a young Bobby DeNiro, spent Spanish wisdoms
In a whip with dinero, crime organized like the Pharoahe
I cream, I diamond gleam
High post like Hakeem, got a lot of things to drop
Brooklyn to Queens, I gotta keep my steam
Niggas wanna try to hem my long jeans
Uptown fiend for Jay-Z to appear on the scene
In the meanwhile, here's something dope for y'all to lean
Liaison for days on end
Money make the world go around so I made some to spend
Can I live, did dough with my nigs, dividends flow
Like the Mississippi Riv', looking jig
Can't do for dolo, had to turn away when Tony killed Manolo
That's real, mixed feelings like a mulatto
Thug thought he was O.G. Bobby Johnson
I played him like Benny Blanco
Mano a mano, you ain't ready
I fondle triggers straight up
Shoot my guns horizontal, get your weight up
I am two-point-two pounds
You're barely a hundred and twenty-five grams
Wouldn't expect y'all to understand this money
Do the knowledge, due to few dollars, I'm due to demolish
Crews Brooklyn through Hollis to a hood near you, what the fuck?"

Promisin' bank transactions and even bitcoin
I never peaced it up, that shit don't sit well with me
Before I take a truce, I'll take 'em to Hell with me
If that money got in the hands of a crash dummy
Could jeopardize my family and burden the ones who love me
Niggas mad 'cause I decided not to pretend
Y'all stay politically correct, I'ma do what I did
Ain't no sympathy here, this shit's hilarious
It's a lot of opinions, but no power to carry it
2025, they still movin' on some scary shit
Tell 'em quit they job and pay the real niggas they severance
Don't insult my intelligence, I'm not just for the television
Teleport to Bullets Road and dig up all my relatives
Okay, nigga, let's settle it, these niggas been fake loyal
Since y'all pandering to choose a side, let me do it for you
Okay, fuck your hip-hop, I watched the party just die
Niggas cackling about— while all of y'all is on trial
Niggas thought that I was antisocial when I stayed inside of my house
You better off to have one woman, everything tricky right now
You niggas live in denial
Ayy, fuck anybody empathetic to the other side, I vow
A bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with 'em in style
Exterminate 'em right now
Make Katt Williams and them proud, the truth 'bout to get loud
No juice inside of my cup, I sober up and knock 'em all off
Don't let no white comedian talk about no Black woman, that's law
I know propaganda work for them, and fuck whoever that's close to them
The niggas that coon, the niggas that bein' groomed, slide on both of them
You ever ate Cap'n Crunch and proceeded to pour water in it?
Pulled over by the law, you ridin' dirty, so you can't argue with 'em?
Then make it to be a star, bare your soul and put your heart up in it?
Well, I did
Whacked the murals out, but it ain't no legends if my legend ends"
Travis Scott	33	Pornography	Rodeo	2015	[Chorus]	"No monogamy, ménage with me

It's 10:05 PM and the curtain starts to go up
And I'm already sweatin', but I'm locked and loaded
For rapid fire spittin' for all the concert-goers
Scopes for sniper vision, surprise from out of nowhere
As I slide the clip in from inside the hotel
Leanin' out the window, going Keyser Söze
Finger on the trigger, but I'm a licensed owner
With no prior convictions, so law says sky's the limit
So my supply's infinite, strapped like I'm a soldier
Got 'em hopping over walls and climbing fences
Some of them John Travolta, staying alive by inches
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)
Cops are knockin', oh fuck, thought I blocked the entrance
Guess show time is over
No suicide note, just a note for target distance
But if you'd like to know the reason why I did this
You'll never find a motive, truth is I have no idea
I am just as stumped, no signs of mental illness
Just tryin' to show ya the reason why we're so fucked
'Cause by the time it's over, won't make the slightest difference
(Hello, darkness, my old friend)"

Lupe Fiasco	23	Little Death	Tetsuo & Youth	2015	[Verse 2]	"They keep the bottles just to make glass houses
Then climb up to the second floors and throw rocks out it
Then expect not a volley in reply
Some place vulnerable like probably in the eye
What of the chicken? What is it missin'? Is it dry?
Did it die in some inhumane conditions so it didn't go relaxed
And the tension from its demise
Pulled all of the flavor from the fat and made it flat
And rather lifeless, well there's a place
That has a stunning turbot and more mercifully murdered Pisces
But barbaric are still the prices
It's rather niceless, apricot in dices and fromage slices
My son will call risotto rices
If and when he's left to his own devices, well
How is your memory? Is it returning like a lemon tree
To bear bitter fruit of what you meant to me?
Or was it slippin' like permission? Am I trippin' like field
I feel I'm grippin' but maybe the transmission
Still left out the life, also left out the will, grief
Will cheese never touch your teeth
Maybe like kosher beef
Is it real? Is it real? Is it real? Ha, hah!"

And watch a flick, illin' and rootin' for the villain, huh
Plus, every morning, I go out and love it sort of chilly
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies
After bein' blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexin'
Keep lubrication, lifestyle protection
Pickin' up my stereo's remote control quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck — rockin' the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, well, acappella rhymes'll
Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella
Go get your crew, hops, I'm prepared to bomb troops

Without a fair chance to fight back, but I'll be right back!
He never seen us, Sos' gave the MAC to Venus and Vicious
Lookin' delicious, handle yo' bidness
And step to him, shake your ass, try to screw him
Do what ya gotta do to get to him
A tight Parasuco with young faces
Can turn niggas Buttafuoco of all ages (Yeah)
They was amused by the way they walked, way they talked
Only if they knew these girls had sprayed New York
If they've had to, heard him ask Venus, ""Could I have you?""
He jumped out the Jeep, heard her tell him, ""Don't grab, boo!""
They started chattin', was only 'bout a minute flat when
They jumped in the back of the Jeep laughin'
We followed 'em, pollyin', he thought the hoes were Somalian
Probably when they hit the Holiday Inn
I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and 'em
We laid low about a hour or so, these bitches movin' too slow
We both holdin', what if them wild hoes started foldin'?
Sosa said, ""Say no more"", we started rollin'
Before we got in, they must've shot him, security wildin'

Big Pun	24	Beware	Capital Punishment	1998	[Verse 1]	"Yo, what you thought, Pun's shit was weak? Now you can't sleep
Gotta keep your eyes open wide and hide your face from the streets
I'm like the beast with a warrant, far from a law man
Gave you fair warnin', now you on the stairs fallin'
I'm callin' out any rapper that I doubt, smack him in the mouth
Throw him in the yoke, boom, then I knock him out
No doubt, Freddie Foxxx files
Twenty-shot auto Glock, ""blaow!"", Benny Blanc' Puerto Rock style
With a twist of black and I'm proud, twist your cap and I'm out
Sleep with the fish-dips for yappin' too loud
What's happenin' now? Niggas is hard as hell but they Gargamels
Pickin' on the smallest victim gives 'em heart to kill
My squad is real and holds it down, the hardest regardless
We're size of the largest
We polish the floor with the rawest hardcore artists
Flawless victory, ya niggas can't do shit to me
Physically, lyrically, hypothetically, realistically
I'm the epitome of catchin' wreck
Catch you when you cash your check
Smash you when you pass, then jack you for your fuckin' 'Lex
Nothin' less than the best if the Squad did it
Hard-headed niggas better beware and fear like God said it"
Gang Starr	21	Mostly Tha Voice	Hard to Earn	1994	[Chorus]	"It's mostly the voice that gets you up

Kanye West	5	The New Workout Plan	The College Dropout	2004	[Chorus]	"It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me

Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out now
Maybe we can work it out"
Gang Starr	21	Mass Appeal	Hard to Earn	1994	[Verse 2]	"Oh yes, I'm greater than all MC's when I breeze
Give me room, please
I be like fascinatin' when I be updatin'
Cuttin' off wack kids, pullin' their trump cards
I thump hard and make 'em say that I'm God
Niggas be pretendin' they're hardcore
Never know the meaning of raw
But I get props like a slogan
And no man could ever try to diss when I kicks my jam
Lyrically def and connectin', complete mic-wreckin'
No double-checkin', vocals kill like weapons
But if I have to, I go all out with no mic
Yeah, that's right, 'cause I survived mad fights
And for my peeps, I truly care
'Cause without some of them, I wouldn't be here
And they all know how I feel
'Cause suckers be like playin' themselves to have mass appeal"
Rakim	10	Guess Who’s Back (Alternative Mix)	The 18th Letter	1997	[Verse 3]	"Yo, my rhymes and lyrics, find spirits like a seance
Since fat Cray-ons, I write and display chaos
My plan is damage, the diagram to where the jam
I take advantage, until the crowd go bananas
What a rush I hear cuts then I lust to touch
Microphones get clutched by the illustrious
Word spread I inherited, many ways to say the unsaid
Born with three 7's in my head
In time no one can seem to blow your mind as far as this
To find you'll need philosophers and anthropologists
Astrologists, professors from your smartest colleges
With knowledge of scholarships, when Ra be droppin this
Some of the things I know, will be in your next Bible
When I die go bury me and my notebook in Cairo
With the great God from Egypt manifest was write rhymes
Align with the stars, I come back to bless the mic"
Travis Scott	33	MELTDOWN	UTOPIA	2023	[Verse 2]	"Is you fuckin' crazy? Is you fuckin' crazy? (Ah)

Keep this shit open like 7-Eleven (It's lit)
Me at the house, I got seven in heaven
They think I'm satanic, I keep me a reverend
Lil' shawty a therapist (yeah), poppin' her shit
She inching my way then she started confessing
I know what's at stake, I'm screamin', ""Free Jeffery""
Connect collect calls right off of the celly
Gave her the blues, not talkin' 'bout belly
Don't keep it sincere, I go Makaveli
I got the juice, now it's heavy (Juice)
Always on t-time, been ready (T, ah), yeah
Is you fucking crazy? Is you f— (Yeah, stoned, let's go)

Nate Dogg	3	A Doggz Day Afternoon	Dogg Food	1995	[Outro]	"I ain't never seen a joint that I couldn't light
And I ain't never seen a busta that didn't bite

I ain't never seen a game that didn't multiply
We gettin' kinda deep, yeah, the crew and I"
50 Cent	19	High All the Time	Get Rich or Die Tryin’	2003	[Chorus]	"I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris'
Tanqueray or Alizé, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I stay high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)"
Kanye West	5	Crack Music	Late Registration	2005	[Chorus]	"Ugh, that's that crack music, crack music

Lupe Fiasco	23	Chopper	Tetsuo & Youth	2015	[Verse 7]	"Uh-huh, my nigga, what we doing?
Ayy, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
AR-15 with collapsible stock
Picatinny rail with a three-point harness
With 150 round magazine and a dot
Ayy, FMJ’s by the box, nigga
Got the same setup as the SWATs, nigga
Shouldn’t find that surprising
Cause I bought the motherfucker from a cop
Ayy, seen a lot of brown money as a shorty
Welfare baby can’t afford me
Healthcare there, I ain’t worried
Healthcare there, I ain’t worried
Ayy, excuse me as I repeat myself
Work twice as hard to complete myself
My opposition is not pretending
When I work twice as hard to defeat myself
Fuck being a hip-hop purist
When I'm  spendin’ 50 thousand on Securus
Embrace the contradiction, you’ll feel us
RIP to the homies but long live the killas
It’s why I look at God kinda odd
Cause these are the cards that he deal us
Ramen can’t fill us, Medicaid can’t heal us
And the mommas can’t stop us and these choppers might kill us
Look these wild niggas in they eyes
In the video it's some niggas that done died
Looked the ghosts in the face and I cried
No Wu-Tang, just Lu gang when I ride
With an L up
Sayin' ""Free the guys"" like I'm Durk (them hittas!)
With a clean record but I’m cursed
To make a half a million off a verse
Nigga, chop"
Scarface	11	Mind Playing Tricks on Me	We Can’t Be Stopped	1991	[Verse 3]	"Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't keep a steady hand, because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Prayin' for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still, it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift when I drive
Havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I die, then my child'll be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feelin' lonely
My mind is playin' tricks on me"

Kendrick Lamar	16	Momma	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Outro]	"I say, where you at? From the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal anyway
I can be your advocate
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is"

Told my girl I been cuttin' off shorty, wouldn't hit her anyway
Same day, any way, then had to make sure she sign an NDA
Pretty girls all across the world, they know sensei
This mud got my mind gone, different tax bracket, different time zone
Drink out the Styrofoam, but I ain't never been this high though
I just got my roll on, I ain't popped like this in so long
I just like to vibe on her, went plain jane, two-tone
Took a couple uppers, downers, mixed 'em up together
Runnin' through this money like it's never felt better
I just went to Cleef and bought the store from overseas
Shorty got me blowin' money fast like Meech"

The actual fact is that I'm black and bound to attract
The attention of another, I mean the other
But I'm a motherfucker that'll have 'em runnin' for cover
You see, I don't give a fuck about nothin'
Except gettin' paid, gettin' bitches, and issuin' stitches
Which is, all needed to read it and find a rhyme
And then it's time to say, the nigga's here to stay
But what about the fake niggas, the house niggas
To get paid quick they gotta suck a fat dick
But N.W.A. is outta your motherfuckin' range
We ain't gonna change a motherfuckin' thang!"
Big Boi	26	Claimin’ True	Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik	1994	[Chorus]	"I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues
Uh, one, two, three, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the players that's in back of me
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes

Nas	9	I Gave You Power	It Was Written	1996	[Chorus]	"How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might've took your first child
Scarred your life or crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buck-wild

It's that shit that moves crowds, making every ghetto foul
I might've took your first child
Scarred your life or crippled your style

Give me a drug so I can make seven babies
Pump my breasts up, can you suck the fat up 
Please make my life appear like ain't no such thing as bad luck 
My nose ain't right, think I need a new one
Just take your pick, a yellow, red, a black, or a blue one
Virtual reality? virtual bullshit! 
Synthesizer preachers can reach you up in the pulpit
Who a bitch? 
Give me my gat so I can smoke this nigga
Tell his momma not to cry 
Because they can clone him quicker
Than it took his daddy to make him
Niggas bitin verbatim 
Thought provokin' records radio never played dem
Instant, quick grits, new, improved 
Hurry hurry, rush rush, world on the move 
Marijuana illegal but cigarettes cool
I might look kinda funny but I ain't no fool 
Now if you wanna synthesize I empathize 
Now if you wanna synthesize I empathize 
But if you synthesize I will understand 
You'll synthesize a man"
Kanye West	5	Gorgeous	My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy	2010	[Verse 2]	"Is hip-hop just a euphemism for a new religion?
The soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
But this is more than just my road to redemption
Malcolm West had the whole nation standing at attention
As long as I'm in Polo smiling, they think they got me
But they'd try to crack me if they ever see a Black me
I thought I chose a field where they couldn't sack me
If a nigga ain't shootin' a jumpshot, runnin' a track meet
But this pimp is at the top of Mount Olympus
Ready for the world's games, this is my Olympics
We make 'em say ho 'cause the game is so pimpish
Choke a South Park writer with a fishstick
I insisted to get up off of this dick
And these drugs, niggas can't resist it
Remind me when they tried to have Ali enlisted
If I ever wasn't the greatest, nigga, I must have missed it"

Have your whole hood holla shit about my progression"
Kanye West	5	Gorgeous	My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy	2010	[Verse 3]	"I need more drinks and less lights
And that American Apparel girl in just tights
She told the director she tryna get in a school
He said, ""Take them glasses off and get in the pool""
It's been a while since I watched the tube
'Cause like a Crip set, I got way too many blues for any more bad news
I was looking at my resume, feeling real fresh today
They rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday
And what's a Black Beatle anyway, a fuckin' roach?
I guess that's why they got me sitting in fuckin' coach
My guy said I need a different approach
'Cause people is looking at me like I'm sniffin' coke
It's not funny anymore, try different jokes
Tell 'em hug and kiss my ass, X and O
And kiss the ring while they at it, do my thing while I got it
Play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
Act like I ain't had a belt in two classes
I ain't got it, I'm coming after whoever who has it
I'm coming after whoever, who has it?
You blowin' up, that's good, fantastic
That, y'all, it's like that, y'all
I don't really give a fuck about it at all
'Cause the same people that tried to blackball me
Forgot about two things, my Black balls"

Okay it was a black man a white man and a Chinese man
The black man of course he was po' (Yeah)
The white man, he was rich (Uh-huh)
And the Chinese man, he owned a sto' (Aight c'mon)
Okay the black man lived on Beat Street
The white man lived on Wall Street
And at the Chinese man's store is where they all meet
Not really on the good foot
Cause the white man kept steppin' on the black man's toes (Damn!)
And in his shoes there were holes
But the white man didn't care, shit;
He didn't have to wear it (Uh-uh)
The scratch that he had, he got from his parents
With his tight ass, he woulda been poor white trash, but anyway
Everyday the black man would ask him to spare change
But at him, the white man would stare strange
So the black man got fed up
Cause wasn't nobody feedin' him and feedin' him
And took red by his neck and started beatin' him and beatin' him
The Chinese man got 'noid and broke out like a peon
And now the black man own the store
And the name of it is Leon's (What's that?)
Barbecue, that is! (Oh...)
Rib tips, hotsauce, mild sauce, fries, and chicken"

Body moves like aerobics attractions, vibes I caught came from your ways and actions
But mind-frame, hard to explain, no actin' or mind games
But thinkin' of what can happen is migraines, the X-rated thought remains
We relaxin' and you naggin' me fo' the agony to yo' anatomy by the fractions
Your measurements, the pleasure's in every inch of your temple
I travel twenty-three million miles of your mental
Chemistry between you and me, in harmony
Causin' angles to meet like trigonometry

Kurupt	4	I Call Shots	Tha Streetz Iz a Mutha	1999	[Chorus]	"I call, I call shots round here
Tell who to pop and who not to pop round here
Slow down, down there, don't make too much noise
You know who runs the blocks round here

Tell who to pop and who not to pop round here
Slow down, down there, don't make too much noise
You know who runs the blocks round here"
Kanye West	5	Spaceship	The College Dropout	2004	[Chorus]	"I've been working this grave-shift
And I ain't made shit

Lupe Fiasco	23	Dumb It Down	Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool	2008	[Verse 3]	"And I'm brainless, which means I'm headless
Like Ichabod Crane is
Or foreplay-less sex is, which makes me saneless
With no neck left to hang the chain with
Which makes me necklace-less, like a necklace theft
And I ain't used my headrest yet
They said they need proof like a vestless chest
About the best-fed F-F jet in the nest
Who exudes confidence and excess depth
Even Scuba Steve would find it hard to breathe
Around these leagues; my snorkel is a tuba
Lu the ruler around these seas
Westside Poseidon, Westside beside 'em
Chest-high and rising, almost touching the knees
Of stewardess and the pilot, lucky they make ya fly with
Personal floating devices, tricks falling out of my sleeves
David Blaine, make it rain
You make a boat, I make a plane
Then, I pull the plug and I make it drain
Until I feel like flowing and filling it up again
Westside!"
Daz Dillinger	2	Let’s Play House	Dogg Food	1995	[Verse 1]	"Young Daz struck a match, and the match went out
But it wadn't no mo' lights in the house, check it out
Speakin' of house, let's play a game of it
Are ya wit' it? Hide and Go Get It, I betcha love it, baby
I'll play the daddy, and you can play the mama
So we can get down upon the livin' room flo'
Are ya wit' it? I promise I won't kill it
Puddy-cat on the loose — what should I do? Should I kill it? Yeah!"
Dr. Dre	1	Automobile	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Verse 4]	"All I want is the pussy (pussy pussy)
All I want is the pussy (pussy)
All I want is the pussy (goddamn right)
All I want is the pussy (pussy pussy pussy pussy pussy pussy pussy on my mind)
If you'd be good to me (yeah hoe)
Ohh I'll be good to you
And we'll both ride home in my automobile (hahah kick some more shit)
We'll both ride home in my automobile (hahahha ohh yeah)

Common	22	Cold Blooded	Like Water for Chocolate	2000	[Verse 2]	"The simps, please uhh uhh uhh uhh
These studs mention me, uhh uhh uhh uhh
As a, intense MC, sent to be the reign
On the industry I came
With penitentiary talk, Coke and a Hennesey walk
My imagery talks, metaphors and similes stalk
Time for war, my artillery caulks the hardest nigga
I'm killin 'em soft
Dealin with golf, gettin blowed on the course
I be dissin magazines, but then buy The Source
Can't explain why the force, is with me
Known to bring a rapper down - like Bobby did Whitney
Sophisticated sissies strut like this is Beat Street in backpacks
Braggin how they don't eat meat and abstract
I backsmack em with they skateboard, flee the crime scene
With a rhyme scheme to escape frauds
Make broads become queens, run things like a rasta sprinter
The way you want the game I rub off like henna
I remain like a tattoo with natural raps
Copy like a fax that's y'all actual facts
Battle raps is where it began, I'mma end it wherever I land
I done thought of, a master plan, it goes"
André 3000	27	Hollywood Divorce	Idlewild	2006	[Outro]	"(Starts off like a small town marriage)
Hollywood divorce
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing
(Lively wife and life, baby carriage)
Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap
(Now all the stars have cars, success of course)
Not even talkin' about music
Everything else, too
(But it ends in Hollywood divorce)
By the time it reach Hollywood, it's over
(Hollywood divorce)
But it's cool
We just keep it goin' and make new shit"
Guru	20	Make ’Em Pay	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 2]	"Yo, I be your highness, in slickness, you chumps bear witness
Tremendous trooper, verbal nigga with the fitness
Drop you for your spot with the blazer then I blast you
Slice precise like Benihana's when I come to bring the dramas
Styles so swift, that you can't peep the god
As your lyrics get buried, six feet deep in my backyard
I laugh hard, while your mental I run through mazes
Dark stages of terror to shatter your dressing room mirror
Your whole error gets crushed, your whole show gets bumrushed
Too many dumb punks, want to enter this rap scene
Kicking Willie Bobo, but need to be slapped clean
Into oblivion, the true champion always rises
I bring surprises to the chief plus their advisers
Size me up, and you will find nothing's larger
Catch more wreck on your dome, than a deranged fucking barber
So what you made some dough, you best keep on scrambling
All your vanity, is instantly crushed, when I start handling
Demanding that you pay, for your weak rhyme display
Coast to coast, I break the fakes everyday"
JAY-Z	6	Encore	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 2]	"Look what you made me do! Look what I made for you!
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 4-5, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team!
And I need you to remember one thing (One thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream 'til your lungs get sore"
The Game	13	Too Much	Doctor’s Advocate	2006	[Chorus]	"Too much Cris' in the club not to get drunk
Too many bitches in the world not to fuck
Too much chronic in the studio not to roll it up
And too much bass in the trunk, so let it bump"
50 Cent	19	Hate It or Love It (G-Unit Remix)	The Massacre	2005	[Bridge]	"From the beginnin to the end, losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change, it's stayin' the same"
Eminem	15	I Will	Music to Be Murdered By	2020	[Chorus]	"I thought I heard a voice in my head that said ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will"""
Kanye West	5	All of the Lights	My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy	2010	[Verse 1]	"Somethin' wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university"
Eminem	15	Hailie’s Song	The Eminem Show	2002	[Verse 2]	"My baby girl (Girl), keeps gettin' older ('Der)
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes (Jokes) 'cause they don't understand me (Me)
They just don't see my real side, I act like shit don't faze me
Inside it drives me crazy, my insecurities could eat me alive"
JAY-Z	6	Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)	Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life	1998	[Chorus]	"It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Compton	good kid, m.A.A.d city	2012	[Verse 3]	"So come and visit the tire screeching, ambulance, policeman
Won't you spend a weekend on Rosecrans, nigga?
Khaki creasing, crime increasing on Rosecrans, nigga
Kendrick Conan, nigga
Where you sword at, hand on the cross and swore that
I do it big as Rasputia for them shooters
Kama Sutra scream fuck your position and make you hold that
I'm trying to stay grounded like four flats
But I know flats and Piru Crip tats"
Eminem	15	Beautiful	Relapse	2009	[Chorus]	"But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you, so"
Kanye West	5	Touch the Sky	Late Registration	2005	[Verse 2]	"Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dawg, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song, now"
Travis Scott	33	WAKE UP	ASTROWORLD	2018	[Verse]	"Please don't wake me up, I feel it creepin' (Yeah)
Controllin' how you movin', lucid dreamin' (Dreams)
Always on the side of different seasons, yeah-yeah
Took the beltway down to your hood (It's lit)
Say you was in the crowd, I never looked
Lookin' back how things came back around, guess I was hooked
Burn the bread and then we burn the town, we both was cooked, yeah
Nah, nah, please don't wake me up, feel like I'm dreamin'
Any given Sunday, you can get it, Willie Beamen
I can make your Mondays even better like the weekend (Yeah)
That's my Coco, I'm her Ice-T (Coco, yeah, yeah)
Bend her over for some pipin' (It's lit)
Bust a cloud, shoot the lightnin' (Pop it)
Pop it now, know we can't sleep (Sleep)"
JAY-Z	6	MaNyfaCedGod	4:44	2017	[Interlude]	"Our external reality is an opportunity to heal our internal upset
Let's build a cathedral these evils couldn't fuck with
I wanna spend my Saturdays and my latter-days
Eating sundaes and enjoying Mondays
Not worrying about what none say"
The Game	13	Letter to the King	LAX	2008	[Verse 3]	"The word ""nigga"" is nothin' like ""nigga""
Don't sound shit alike, like Game, like Jigga
One came before the other, like aim and pull the trigga
One is slang for my brother, one is hang and take a picture
The rope ain't tight enough, he still alive, go fix it
Pour some gasoline on him, call his daughters black bitches
Make 'em pick cotton, while they mama cleanin' up the kitchen
Same cotton in white T's, that's the cotton they was pickin'
If Dr. King marched today, would Bill Gates march?
I know Obama would but would Hilary take part?
Great minds think great thoughts
The pictures I paint, make the Mona Lisa look like fake art
I feel the pain of Nelson Mandela
Cause when it rains it pours, I need Rihanna's umbrella
For Coretta Scott's tear drops, when she got the phone call
That the future just took a fuckin' head shot
I wonder why Jesse Jackson ain't catch him before his body dropped
Would he give me the answer? Probably not"
JAY-Z	6	Allure	The Black Album	2003	[Chorus]	"It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most 
But every time I felt ""That was that,"" it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back "
Dr. Dre	1	Animals	Compton	2015	[Verse 2]	"Damn, why the fuck are they after me? Maybe 'cause I'm a bastard?
Or maybe 'cause of the way my hair grow naturally?
Still tryna figure out why the fuck I'm full of rage
I think I noticed this bullshit right around the fifth grade
Paraphernalia in my locker right next to the switchblade
Nothin' but pussy on my mind and some plans of gettin' paid
But I'm a product of the system, raised on government aid
And I knew just how to react when it was time for that raid
Just a young black man from Compton, wonderin', 'who could save us?'
And could barely read the sentences the justice system gave us
So many rental cars with bricks, I think they probably funded Avis
Some of us was imbalanced but some us used our talents, shit
Not all of us criminals but cops be yellin', ""Stay back, nigga!""
We need a little bit of payback (Payback!)
Don't treat me like an animal 'cause all this shit is flammable
Don't fuck around 'cause when it's done, it's done
Fuck you!"
The Game	13	Da Shit	Doctor’s Advocate	2006	[Verse 2]	"I'm back on the cover of The Source and the XXL
Floatin' all through the (Streets of Compton)
I got more bitches, more plaques
More beef and more straps
That's what the fuck I call gangsta rap
I was the Aftermath remedy 'til friends turned enemies
Streets kept me laced like blunts dipped in Hennessy
You niggas act like The Game can't roll 'em out
One man show, still sell a motherfucker out
With no Dre still sell the motherfucker out
'Cause everybody here from the (Streets of Compton)
We got Crip niggas, Blood niggas, ese's, Asians
Red and blue laces, tattoos on faces
I kept you niggas waitin', had to take you back to the basics
Switch the Impala from gold to chrome Daytons
Every time your bitch hear my voice she masturbatin'
I run through hoes like Walter Payton, on the daily
I got your main bitch swallowin' my babies"
Kanye West	5	Late	Late Registration	2005	[Chorus]	"I'll be late for that, baby, I'll wait for that
If you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that
I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right
I'll be late for that, I can't wait for that
I think I was made for that
So I'm comin' in when I feel like
So turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right"
Big L	25	Let ’Em Have It “L”	Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous	1995	[Verse 3]	"The Big L's back to attack with a phat rap
Matter of fact, black, I'm puttin' Harlem on the map
Wassup cause I'm a stiggy star
Breakin' 'em up and then takin' they heart
You better believe that Big L is the man that be rippin' the microphones apart
I'm undefeated that's the stone truth
'Cause battlin' me is like fightin' a gorilla in a phone booth
I take lives with no pride, I just committed a homicide
A punk brother died cause he tried
To take my cash but he didn't last, I pulled out fast
He tried to bash then I blast on his monkey ass
I make a lot of dough, I'm quick to spot a foe
Even if my grandma violate, she gotta go!
When I was young I played with guns, not a kiddy toy
Cause I'm a rough, rugged gangsta, not a pretty boy
Facts on tracks I recite well
Everybody wanna be like Mike, but Mike wanna be like L"
Kendrick Lamar	16	i (Album Version)	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 1]	"They wanna say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme, uh
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front, yeah)
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace (Oh, yeah)
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me, motherfucker, I smile"
The Game	13	Gang Related	The Documentary 2.5	2015	[Outro Voicemail]	"Blood! Chuck, you know what it is, Blood!

Kanye West	5	I Am a God	Yeezus	2013	[Verse 1]	"Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you
'Cause kissin' people ass is so unlike you
The only rapper compared to Michael
So here's a few hatin'-ass niggas to fight you
And here's a few snake-ass niggas to bite you
And I don't even wanna hear 'bout what niggas might do
Old niggas mentally still in high school
Since the tight jeans they ain't never liked you
Pink-ass polos with a fuckin' backpack
But everybody know you brought real rap back
Nobody had swag, man, we the Rat Pack
Virgil, Pyrex, Don C snapback
Ibn diamond, Chi-town shinin'
Monop' in this bitch again, changed the climate
Hop in this bitch to give Saint the garment
Until the day I get struck by lightning"

Scarface	11	Mind Playing Tricks on Me	We Can’t Be Stopped	1991	[Verse 1]	"At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
Four walls just starin' at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't livin' right
But I ain't goin' out without a fight
See, every time my eyes close
I start sweatin' and blood starts comin' out my nose
Is somebody watchin' the Ak'?
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin' my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say, ""Take a chill, B.""
But fuck that shit! There's a nigga tryin' to kill me
I'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows
Every 20 seconds got me peepin' out my window
Investigatin' the joint for traps
Checkin' my telephone for taps
I'm starin' at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind's playin' tricks on ya"
Snoop Dogg	0	Betta Days	No Limit Top Dogg	1999	[Verse 1]	"Celebrate, grab a drink and put a blunt in the sky
Worldwide, nigga it's 1999
Shit out of control, sign of the times
I ain't had this much fun since '79
I was only eight then, hadn't been to the penn'
Just a young nigga on the front of a swing
Playin' football up in Poly High
Too young to ride but it's still Eastside
Homicides didn't happen much, niggas wasn't rappin much
It's 99 nigga, shit, I know you strappin up
Hell motherfuckin yeah, nigga wanna see the end
So next year we can do it all again
Same dogg channel, same dogg time
Only the strong will survive in 99
So much drama and delusion, my conclusion is confusing
Drifting on my memories, twisted off my music
Tryin to make my people do things, oh yeah we do's it, we do's it
Here's my number baby girl don't you lose it
It's smoky in this motherfucker while we cruising
Them Eastside niggas is the shadiest (shadiest)
But them Westside niggas is the craziest (craziest)

2Pac	18	Lord Knows	Me Against The World	1995	[Verse 2]	"I wonder if the Lord will forgive me or bury me a G
I couldn't let my adversaries worry me
And every single day it's a test, wear a bulletproof vest
And still a nigga stressin' over death
If I could choose when a nigga die, figure I'd
Take a puff on the blunt and let my trigga fly
When everyday it's another death with every breath
It's a constant threat, so watch yo' step!
You could be next if you want to, who do you run to?
Murderin' niggas, look what it's come to
My memories bring me misery, and life is hard
In the ghetto, it's insanity, I can't breathe
Got me thinking, what do Hell got?
'Cause I done suffered so much, I'm feelin' shell-shocked
And driveby's an everyday thang
I done lost too many homies to this motherfuckin' game
And Lord knows"

And I got hunger pain that grow insane, tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open, I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I prob'ly sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough"

Prodigy	8	Adrenaline	Murda Muzik	1999	[Verse 1]	"It makes you sick to hear the Mobb bang like this
Infamous for the world to hate or play this
Don't give a fuck if you can't rock with this
My duns heads bop to this
We stand out like a terrace
And make more noise than them other rap niggas
No gimmicks
Just pure adrenaline
Raw lyrics incredible beats
Don't mean to rub it in
But your small time beneath our feet
Straight ass cheeks niggas be askin
For ass whippings
Guns kick like Pelé
My big shit be jumping like Jordan
Often lay a man down on the floor when it gets like that
I'm not blowing off rounds so you can hear sounds
So you can run back actin like you a vet
And swearin' you dead
You survived some real shit
Now what's this it's not going down like this
Ground that nigga like punishment
Dumpin' out whole clips when we dumb out
Though I'd rather do music and chill the fuck out
Dun you bugged out I'm trying to walk a peaceful route
But niggas always got mouth until that piece come out
Niggas always gonna think something sweet
'Til when they least expect you bringing action exactly"

Busting rachets or numbers rackets or drug traffic
My funds are wrapped up, no concerns who has what
Financier, skull do-ragged up
Mob life, prizefights, plasma TVs or first roll
Diversified dough in my circle
Amid the most sickest groom the proof swiftness
Numero uno, annuit coeptis
That's the language of our Latin ancestors
On the back of a dollar, the plan and the message
In a Rolls Royce like the King of Nigeria
My criteria, smoke cigars
Change rap like Jimi Hendrix changed Rock 'n' Roll
With a broke guitar, diamonds flashing
Almost put a million cash in my mommy casket
Seen more green than St. Patrick, trick"
Snoop Dogg	0	Drop It Like It’s Hot	R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece	2004	[Chorus]	"When the pimp's in the crib, ma

When the pigs try to get at you

And if a nigga get a attitude
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)

And I roll the best weed, 'cause I got it goin' on"

Niggas turnt up and we bout to hit the street
The homie on probation, make him sit up in the back
Bout to hit the weed spot and get another sack

Down for whatever cuz the homies roll deep
Finger on the trigger, bandana round the Mac
Ride through the hood with a cup full of 'gnac"
2Pac	18	Brenda’s Got a Baby	2Pacalypse Now	1991	[Verse]	"I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
""That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family""
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now Brenda really never knew her moms
And her dad was a junkie, puttin' death into his arms
It's sad, 'cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came, they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old and she's havin' a baby
In love with a molester, who's sexin' her crazy
And yet and all she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of them are together
Whatever, he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know, so
She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heap, bawlin'
Mama can't help her, but it hurts to hear her callin'
Brenda wants to run away
Mama say ""You makin' me lose pay
There's social workers here every day""
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack but end up gettin' robbed
So now, what's next? It ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute found slain, and Brenda's her name
She's got a baby"
Dr. Dre	1	The Message	2001	1999	[Verse 1]	"Since you finishing em early, what possessed you to start him?
We made a vow - later we'll regret 'til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doing when you made us
So with all due respect, you coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feeling like my whole world is blinded, wondering why
Crying, pouring out my heart, pouring out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, something we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguing telling the truth
He had talent too - I had plans on watching him blow
Don't know what hurts more, seeing him leave, or watching him go"
Eminem	15	As the World Turns	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Chorus]	"('Cause I don't know) And as we go along

We all face small obstacles
(I don't know) And challenges everyday
(Why this world keeps turning) That we must go through
('Round and 'round) These are the things
That surround us through our atmosphere
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now)
(I don't know) Every day
(Why this world keeps turning) Every single day the world keeps turning
('Round and 'round) Keeps turning
(But I wish it would stop and let me off right now) Keeps turning

So how we here trapped on the ocean?
'Bout to go up a level of disrespectful
I'm just one chain away from goin' heavy metal
I'm just one angel away from blockin' out the devil
Just one mountain away from meetin' all my rebels
Too much power, too many hours all in a day
I sent her flowers, ain't talkin roses, I'm talkin' maoda
Ask if she ""ha-ha-ha"", I wouldn't doubt it
Took her through the Hills at noon, she felt the

Gone but not forgotten, homes I still feel ya
So, curse the day that birthed the bastard
Who caused your church mass, reverse the crash
Reverse the blast then reverse the car
Reverse the day and there you are, Bobalob
Lord forgive him, we all have sinned
But Bob's a good dude, please let him in
And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge
Please blame it on the son of the morning, thanks again"

In gangstaville where we shoot to kill
Pop the pill, pop then drop the three-wheels
The tale of tales, fly high as a gazelle
The hell-hound came through to drown the whale
Pronounce, denounce, strip then set sail
Soak in a cloud of smoke then inhale
Hold it in, never exhale
Smoke whoever nigga's zone I'm in, oh well
Fuck you and ya mama

Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
(Nas is like...) Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, After the Death, the last one left
Let my cash invest in stock
Came a long way from blastin' TEC's on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, ownin' acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes givin' fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my 9 spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth? Can't take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise — thug or die
Makin' choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob, steal or kill, I'm wonderin' why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later, we'll all see who the prophet is"

I'm at the top and I'm never comin back again
Except for when I come to scoop lil' shorty good brains
Out the hood, you see me in yo' hood don't play
I open up yo' head, and expose yo' brain
It's not a joke or a game, and I ain't tryin
To advance my rap lines, please believe what I say
I'm a Mobb nigga, nigga I do this all day

Before these minds got ahold to some drugs
And start thinkin' they thugs

Plugged with Gucci promotion, so we got in free
Against the wall me and my guys formed a colony, Ron'll be beatin'
Saved my day, dancin' on speakers
Flames snatched I was born this way
87th Street and Hyde Park was warrin'
Over gossip, Kenwood broads was pourin'
Suited in three-quarter Jordans, pro-models
And Starter coats out the back of Beauty Shop Sevalas
Buy the dope, put my name in they verse, EPMD I would quote Stolen leathers I'd sell, like a child of broke
Behind the beat, I took my first shot of Henny
It hit me in the chest like when them marks shot Benji
Shame on the girl that left her Fendi around crew
Either go through it or, take it, we was bound to
Travellin' like Vice Lords, down to the Taste
Not wantin' to bring my lady around crew 'cause they would snake
House parties was the lick, behind bars we'd come up
At 'em I did the Hooper dance with my thumbs up"

Some'll try to get you stuck up, some'll fake pregnancy
Most are after the dough, and the fame basically
Yo you can't make a ho a housewife kid

Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular, not a church girl, she was secular
Not about the money, those studs was mic-checkin' her
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
But she was there for me, and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out, and listen to her
Sittin' on a bone, wishin' that I could do her
Eventually, if it was meant to be, then it would be
‘Cause we related, physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
Slim was fresh, joe, when she was underground
Original, pure, untampered, a down sister
Boy, I tell you, I miss her"

Y'all niggas talk a lot of shit heard you on the tape frontin'
I fakes nothin', ya fuck around and push the wrong button
I dedicate my days to seein' you drip blood
Will always love Gambo and Scarface
Killa Black, no man can fill your shoes
Now what's bad news
It couldn't get no worse, so what y'all niggas know about the turmoil
What y'all know about the blood, soil, clothes and little hoes
And the legs of pants, slugs that crack the shin bone
The other shots blast through your left clavicle
Melt switch suits and paint the avenues"

I had the Cuban posse all up in my room and lobby
Negotiating like Illuminati
Network with catch-a-body experts
In retrospect to the foul connect
When I lost, but that then was my fault
Now it's time to floss, eye for a eye, what's mine is yours
I need a suite with the flowers complimentary at Trump Towers
Sit at the table, we can build for hours
On getting rich, it's a cinch, take a glimpse
""The World Is Yours"" written all over the blimps
Here's a toast to my foes, it's like a whole new beginning
With Quaaludes and cream and loads of women rockin' linen
I got a plan to blow to Hiroshima, Japan
Moving niggas out the hood and just divide it with fam
And yo, the bitches, like Gee Money said to his man
Will ride the dick like a horse with the cowboy brand"

My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you prob'ly hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam

Hey! Me no worry, hashish keep my eyes Chinese
Rollin' two Phillies together make blunts Siamese
I meant it, I represent it, descendant made of early natives
That were captured and taught to think backwards
Trapped us in a cracker's psychiatric, it's massive
A Million Man March, alert the masses
Tan Clarks, Armani in small print upon my glasses
Don assassins, Armageddon
The wedding of a freak and a beast
Seven heads, got the righteous threatened
Life Was Written, the plot curves behind the settin'
Comprehend the grammar, math we own
Are you the type of nigga to shoot a leg to get your name known?
I flip the brain tone, niggas get hit and wrapped in plastic

Walls tellin' me they full of pain, resentment

Me, I'm just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny

These walls happier when I'm here

Sisters up in my hood try to do good, given choices"
Nas	9	My Country	Stillmatic	2001	[Verse 1]	"Ayo, it's packed on this Rikers bus
The tightest cuffs is holdin' me shackled
The life of a thug caught in the devil's lasso
On the streets I was invincible
Cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew
What my pistol would do, a fuckin' killer
Mother's a dope fiend embarrassin' me
All in front of my friends in the street, smile with no teeth
I never knew daddy, heard he had a '72 caddy
Died in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably three
Why didn't my folks just die in this society
Why wasn't I a child of a doctor who left stocks for me?
Two little brothers, two sisters, them shorties gots to eat
Mother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me
I'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father
Whether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers

Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a–uh–depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada

With way less effort

Gone for two days and I ain't even check the mileage
When we was fighting with Crips it wasn't about no dollars
It was about selling dope to put our kids through college
I'm sitting on the block, reminiscing for hours

I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me"

Everybody tripping, we mix Cîroc with Patrón here
Don't walk around alone here, everybody from a gang
Niggas ask you where you from
That mean you gotta run that chain
Smoking on that purple rain
We only smoke a certain strain
Soon as you call twice nigga
Welcome to the circle maine

End your career with one line, like that nigga
Hit the switch (Front and back), make it bounce (Let it jump)
Killaforn-I-A is where I'm from
Three-wheelin' with the ass out
Smoke chronic 'til I pass out
On the way to my nigga Daz house
He always got a thick bad bitch from Long Beach
She a known freak and she got a long reach
She gon' touch it, suck it, fuck it
Never back down, especially when Al Green in the background
Now, bitch, hit the weed and turn that ass 'round

You niggas Marcus Camby, washed up
Pussy, fix your panties, I'm Mr. Marcus, you gettin' fucked, uh
You ain't heard nothin' harder since Daddy Kane
Take it in vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain
Lightning bolts hit your body, you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write
Strong enough to stand in front of a travelin' freight train, are you trained?
To go against Dracula, draggin' the record industry by my fangs
AK clips, money clips, and gold chains
You walk around with a P90 like it's the '90s
Bullet to your temple, your homicide'll remind me"

Gang Starr	21	The Rep Grows Bigga	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 2]	"Your fame has gotten larger than your life
You've got a harem of bitches and killer niggas that's hype
They got your back, but you so fly you don't need em
You shit where you're eating so you don't peep the proceedings
They start scheming, feeling that you're too swollen
And that's the reason why your cash and stash gets stolen
You start perspiring, because you're paranoid
Still another confrontation that you couldn't avoid
Prepare for drama, as if you were a stunt man
Back in the days you was a forty and a blunt man
Today you're a Willie, now the weather's too chilly
New York City ain't the place to be fronting
Over your shoulders day and night's where you look
Your so-called fam ran a scam, and you got shook
Go back to square one, better go talk to your son
See reps grow bigger in the life of a crook"

She was good to G-O for a nut or two yo
I think her name was Clara
And she was guaranteed to give a motherfucka whatever he needs
To be perfectly honest, she was a hooker
So I took her a hundred yards, to the boulevard
I told her ""I'll take care of you, you take care of me
You've got a P-I-M-P and all I want is the money""
She went to work and the niggas were fiendin'
Yo, she had the biggest ass that you ever seen
In fact she was like Medusa, with titties full grown
One look and your dick turns to stone, yeah
Keepin' in mind that she was the kind that would find the time to get mine
Because she knows I'm not to be fucked with
She ain't crazy
Fuckin' with Dre, she'll be pushin' up daisies
She was the perfect ho, but wouldn't you know
The bitch tried to gank me, so
I had to kill her
Yeah, straight hittin'
Now listen up and lemme tell you how I did it
Yo, I tied her to the bed, I was thinking the worst
But yo, I had to let my niggas fuck her first yeah
Loaded up the .44, yo
Then I straight smoked the ho
Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess she figured
I was soft and she paid the cost to the boss and got tossed
One less bitch you gotta worry about
She's outta here and that's how it turns out"

The storm, my vocals float like arks
In the mystic state of mind, when I create a rhyme
My microphone massacres every year the same time
With audio amputations, vocal thoughts of a loud talker
Up against the microphone night stalker
With a tendency of bashing MCs, like ten of me
As you can see I continue mashin' MCs, kaboom!
The room gets cleared as my views get clearer
Extra-terrestrial microphone terror
In effect, get infected
Tell me what the fuck you expected
These venemous injections
I leave whole sections, and sections full of injections
From these poisonous melodies and selections
I select the methods of slow anguish
I mangle shit with my language
Tell me, have you ever seen one elope
With the microphone
In a scandal like abilities to make MCs explode
Baboom, alone in my own zone
So don't compare me to none
Not one's nearly
Severe, cause I severely, impare MCs
Near me, oppose and fear me, I got plots and theories
Sincerely, I could have the spot locked
Niggas get stoned for touching microphones
With no knowledge on how to rock"

These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again
You and what army could harm me?

I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessin', I got a Smith & Wesson for you
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, gettin' physical
Doin' the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob
Yes, I'm macabre but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growin', just like a fetus
Or a tumor, but here's the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressin' myself — Yella, slam it!
'Cause If I stay funky like this, I'm doin' damage
Or I'mma be too hyped and need a straitjacket
I got knowledge and other suckers lack it
So when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like — it's like we gettin' hype tonight

And once the got him they gon' sure waste him
This ain't no mutha fuckin joke nigga it ain't worth it
And even if your mother gets in it you can't surface
It was all purpose
Just like that bullshit you was serving it was all purpose
We all chipped in nigga and we all hurting
I gots to grind just like in eighty-nine
When a niggas 25 cent pieces look just like baby dimes
I'm on the corner selling whole eights
I don't remember being this fuckin paranoid since I sold weight
I went from 50 sacs to 50 packs
And all because this motherfucker got jipped he wants to jip me back
But when I find him I'm gon' finalize
Just to let a nigga know I'm for real and down to die for mine

You in God's hands now, keep a place for me kid

Machine Gun Funk, from Queens I came through to smoke blunts
You came to my hood, we was broke
I wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gun smoke?
Still on the block around fiends numb from coke, I guess so
'Cause now with paper, shit is still ghetto
But fuck it black, you livin' your life, through your loved ones
Peace to your daughter and your newborn son
It used to be fun, makin' records to see your response
But, now competition is none, now that you're gone
And these niggas is wrong, using your name in vain
And they claim to be New York's king? It ain't about that
It's more serious, I plan to toast it up with you
Joke with you, happy we on top, the most official
Ain't too many real ones out there, I feel some but doubt they're
Capable to take it where you took it to
I missed your wake not 'cause I'm fake
'Cause I hate to see somebody so great in that way
I woulda stayed so long with so much to say
I had to put it in writin' to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin'
Tellin' me to pay my respects and move to the side
But I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by
You can't kill nothin' that's Ready To Die

Big L	25	Who You Slidin’ Wit’	The Big Picture	2000	[Verse 1]	"Henn'-Rock and Alize I get drunk off
What up, miss? Get with a real man and cut that punk off
E'rythang gon' be alright
I been watchin' you watch me all night
I asked honey her name and she told me Celeste
She had big breasts, honey had me harder than a Spanish test
We on the dance floor, gettin' our boogie on
I see the haters watchin' me with their hoodies on
Tryna peep the ice under the sleeve
I'm like, ""It's time to breeze"", told honey, ""Let's leave""
Took her to M&G's, got some eggs and cheese
Grits, fishcakes and orange juice, freshly squeezed
When she finished her meal, I said, ""What's the deal?
For real — you goin' home, or you tryna chill?""
She got close, whispered somethin' slow in my ear
And it ain't hard to tell where we goin' from here
Yeah!"

JAY-Z	6	Justify My Thug	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 2]	"Now if you shoot my dog, I'ma kill yo' cat
Just the unwritten laws in rap, know that
For every action there's a reaction, don't have me relapsin'
Relaxin's what I'm about, but about mine
Don't be actin like you can't see street action
Take me back to Reasonable Doubt time
You see my mind's on the finish line, facin' the wreck
I put my muh'fuckin' faith in the TEC, tell Satan not yet
You understand I am chasin' my breath
I am narrowly escapin' my death, oh yes
I am the Michael Schumacher of the Roc roster
Travellin' Mach 5, barrel in my apparel can stop God
God forgive me but I can't let them deliver me to you
Until, I won this race, then eventually
My engine gon' burn out, I get whatever is meant for me
However it turns out fine, red line!"
2Pac	18	Rebel of the Underground	2Pacalypse Now	1991	[Verse 3]	"They say they hate me, they wanna hold me down
I guess they scared of the rebel - the rebel of the underground
But I never let it get me
I just make another record 'bout the punks tryna sweat me
In fact, they tryin' to keep me out
Try to censor what I say
'Cause they don't like what I'm talkin' 'bout
So what's wrong with the media today?
Got brothers sellin' out cause they greedy to get paid
But me? I'm comin' from the soul
And if it don't go gold, my story still gettin' told
And that way they can't stop me
And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy
It's sloppy, don't even try to
I'm a slave to the rhythm, and I'm about to fly through
So, yo, to the people in the ghetto
When ya hear the bass flow, go ahead and let go
Now everybody wanna gangbang
They talkin' street slang, but the punks still can't hang
They makin' records 'bout violence
But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent
It kinda make you wanna think about
That ya gotta do some sellin' out, just to get your record out
But 2Pacalypse is straight down
So feel the wrath of the rebel - the rebel of the underground"

Tell ya maker, say ya prayers, we some playas but you made us
Mashed potatoes, bad potato, blast you hater, blast the gator
So you might just wanna kick back and drink roots
Take hat to ya woman, relax, break loose
Cause pret' soon if she choose, she gon' walk away from you
Straight to the Rooster cause he's cock-a-doodle poo
What they do fool?
Who's tryna run a small time crap shooting
All time fat chewing, hats got the matching suit and lens
All cats pursuing, kinda wild, it's Idlewild
Time to break it on, break it on down now
Percival take it on out!"

But get outta line, Snoop's upside ya head
The media they write whatever they choose (Yea!)
And the cops stay on my ass so I stay on the news (Whaaaat!)

Went through a bunch of bullshit while I was payin' my dues
They say my music make a gangsta wanna pop somethin' (Woooo!)
Well tell them niggas they'll get popped, they should stop frontin'

In case you motherfuckers wanna jump bad now
Start some bullshit and I'ma lay ya punk ass down"

For me, givin' up's way harder than tryin'
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhymin'
'Cause who the kids gon' listen to? Huh?
I guess me if it isn't you
Last week, I paid a visit to the institute
They got the dropout keepin' kids in the school
I guess I'll cleaned up my act like Prince'll do
If not for the pleasure, least for the principle
They got the CD, they got to see me
Drop gems like I dropped out of PE
They used to feel invisible
Now, they know they invincible"
Big Pun	24	Leather Face	Yeeeah Baby	2000	[Verse 2]	"Word to Pac and Big, my Glock so big it can rock a bridge
Drop the midsection like the top of your wig
Ain't no bullshittin, getting the full treatment
Special two heated missiles, 'til your crew's leaving with you
I rip you in half, blast that ass through a glass window
Laugh a little (HA HA) and dash in the S-Class limo
That's how we do it in the South Boogie
Where tough rough rookies get snuffed out.for talking loud to me
Why should I even consider your crew
Shit on your crew, get rid of your crew, what I'm fitting to do
I split you in two, leave you impaired when I blast the shotty
Rip it like dope and leave you there with half your body
We Rowdy like Roddy, probably robbing your stash
Catch a body like Charlie up North, stashing knives up my ass
Surviving the task, we the last ones left
Blast them TECs with clips, fast as vets that spit
Add some tips for any, bastard bitch, papping shit
Watch me rep to the casket from the bassinet, biatch!
Ahora tu!"
Havoc	7	Drop A Gem On ’Em	Hell On Earth	1996	[Chorus]	"It's the infamous back in the house once again

The Mobb got the bomb, run out and tell a friend
Drop a gem on 'em

Live the life, that of diamonds and guns and now gems
Pull gats like a basehead pull on stems
The Mobb got the bomb, run out and tell a friend
Drop a gem on 'em"
Eminem	15	Beautiful	Relapse	2009	[Verse 3]	"Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves
And flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now, I could've either just sat
On my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in
In every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant actin' stupid
Aunt Edna always told me:
""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that.""
Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen
Stop sign pole at eight-years-old
I learned my lesson then, 'cause I wasn't
Tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
It's probably a 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a
Mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's
Let's see if you can fit your feet—"

My lust is young
I wanna find me a lovely hon, crush me one
Bust a lung, give her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Let her hug me when I'm done
Tongue touch me 'til I'm numb
But first the outcome is income and then some
Get enough to run and spend some for fun
Then me and my thugs, we come in the club
We swung lovely, watch how big the buzz be, trust me son
Every ghetto got game in it, fame in it
We remain in it, waitin' for the main event
Like the days on the corner, we watch the world go by
On the nights that wasn't right
Like when a good friend died
Yo the street's got a deadly hum, like a drug
We need to find a way to fill the neighborhood with love
From the park to the block, to your favorite spot
It don't stop"

Scored a 40 bag and we hit the spot
Put my shit in park and got up under the tree
Pull the Swishers out and gave the ganja to Creep
Wrapped us up a fattie and we started to smoke
Eyes gettin' red cause we higher than coke
A nigga chillin' cause it's all good
And we ain't trippin' on the bullshit, nigga, because we all hood
But other niggas don't wanna see it that way
But all I got to say is, ""You don't wanna see that S.A.​""
Because we're all upon a mission
Killin' don't make us no difference
And dyin' don't make it no different
'Cause I done been to mo' wakes in this past year
Than the motherfuckin' Bengals lost last year
So ain't no motherfuckin' thang for me
To kill a nigga who ain't fuckin' with the gang with me"

I put some drug money on her arm
I get a line on you, we scoring"
Lupe Fiasco	23	PRECIOUS THINGS	DRILL MUSIC IN ZION	2022	[Verse 1]	"Never bite the hands that feed
But when those same hands grab the gats and up the sleeves
They gather traps and apparatus for your grief
They catch you lackin', wrap around yo' hatch and squeeze
I swear my hands werе pure, I gave 'em manicurеs
Became my adversaries, became my saboteurs
I put karats on them just like rabbit lures
My middle finger's like, ""Fuck this nigga"", what happened to us?
Used to be clappin' for us, thumbs up and then snappin' poets
Now they be dappin' fo's and grabbin' Moet
And they know that I don't drink
At least I don't think
I asked for peace signs, they gave me Leon Spinks
I asked for ""Okays"", I got, ""Up yours"" and ""Go aways""
Shoo gestures and throat slicers, the motion's made
Give me a sign when we can talk through a plan
But my hands was like ""Fam, you can talk to the hand,"" damn"

Niggas gotta go create his own job
Mr. Mayor, imagine if this was your backyard
Mr. Governor, imagine if it was your kids that starved
Imagine your kids gotta sling crack to survive
Swing a mack to be live, cardiac and get high
It's the ghetto life, yeah, I celebrate it, I live it
And all I got is what you left me with, I'ma get it
And y'all combinin' all the countries, we gon' do the same
Combine all the cliques to make one gang

It's to make a change, citizens of a higher plane"

Who you with? Who you wanna be fuckin'?
Got this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question
I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression
To put this in laymen's terms, I gave her some knowledge
She gave me brains in return, she had to drop out of college
Now all she does is homework, I give her in-house tutorin'
In and out, I'm movin' through her student body union
And she call me professor, say daddy come and test her
So she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester
I'm like, ""At this rate, ma, you'll never graduate""
She said, ""I ain't no fool, I'll make it up in summer school"""
Kendrick Lamar	16	u	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 1]	"I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers, tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit, I'm convinced your tolerance nothin' special
What can I blame you for? Nigga, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
Where was your antennas?
Where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of one-hunnid-thousand but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you fuckin' failure—you ain't no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you—I don't need ya!
The world don't need ya, don't let them deceive ya
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
Fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it, I swear—"

Havoc	7	Temperature’s Rising	The Infamous	1995	[Verse 1]	"What up, son? I heard they got you on the run for a body
Now it's time to stash the guns
They probably got the phones tapped, so I won't speak long
Gimme a hot second, and I'ma put you on
It's all messed up, somebody snitchin' on the crew
And word is on the street is they got pictures of you
Homicide came to the crib last night, six deep
Askin' on your whereabouts and where d'you sleep
They said they just wanna question you, but me and you know
That once they catch you, all they do is just arrest you
Then arraign you, hang you, I don't think so
It's a good thing you bounced for now, just stay low
Once in a blue, I check to see how you're doin'
I know you need loot, so I send it through Western Union
They'd probably knock down the door
In the middle of the night, sometimes around four
Hopin' to find who they lookin' for, but they won't succeed
All they gonna find is mad empty bags of weed
But word, son, you got the projects hotter than hell
Harder for brothers to get they thug on, but oh, well
Son, they know too much, even the hoodrat chicks
""Oh, you heard who did what?"" — No, I don't know who did shit!
So stop askin', and I know I'm not goin' crazy
From windows, I see lights flashin' and maybe
Somebody's takin' pictures, you know who that be
Police lovers, and neighborhood snitches
They put up a G, so everybody's pointin' fingers, and lyin'
A-yo, son! The temp is risin'"

One minute to bounce, and every second counts
I went from hustlin' dicks to makin' hits, bustin' flicks
Now I'm sure to be rich for ninety-six
I pull my 'capes on tapes, and make, papes
Trace the bass, to the tape with the baddest bass to date
I try to shake it but the pace is hard to break
Good thoughts I wait, 'cause they hate my black tape
Yeah, it's on, and it's packed in the rap race
But if ya got a black face, it's a rat race
I struggle to be rugged and raw, Dukes
Tryin' to survive in the trials and lawsuits
Everybody wants to test me, WHY ME?
No lie, niggas cried when they try me
Givin' up the roughness, justice
I'ma bust as I'm rippin' up 'nuff hits
And guess who's back? No longer trapped
'Cause I snapped on the ones that held me back, feel the contact
Ride the track, get a grip as I flip
Ghetto wickedness I kick. Guess who's back?"

I ain't runnin' to get my shit like these other busters
When you see me 'round this bitch I got that motherfucker
So I ain't fuckin' with the club life
I'm like Pac, I'm makin' mail but I still live the thug life
My rap name's gettin' bigger
But ain't nothin' changed, I still got the game to handle all you bitch niggas
So a nigga's always strapped
Nuts been big since a kid you motherfucker so it ain't rap
Toe to toe, back to back, gat for gat
It's like that motherfucker, rat tat tat tat"

Pops was smooth, from his top to his shoes
Sang the blues, guitar strings he played smokin' his Kool
Duke Ellington hat, picture this yo, seventies cat
He wrote his music in the back of the crib, I did my homework
At night the windows were speakers, pumpin' life out
A fight, people screamin' 'cause somebody pulled a knife out
So I look at this room, I'm hooked to this tune
Every night the same melody, hell sounded so heavenly
But jail was ahead of me, was speedin' like amphetamine
Reading's what I should've done, 'cause my imagination would run
I was impatient to get out and become part of the noise out there
I used to stare, five stories down, basketball courts, shot up playgrounds
And I witnessed the murders and police shake-downs
Yo, the hustla's and hoes, drugs and fo'-fo's
This was the life of every kid, lookin' out project windows"

Bam, check off, check, let's go
Pimpin' these hoes, workin' that magic like I'm Don—, damn, uh, woah
Fifty thousand a profit on hoes, that's a bad week
Bust my AP down in arrows causing Richie Mill

Fuck them, buck more shots, get out that bitch
Cribs is found, careful when the kids is out
Torch your house, stalk your kin, bitches and friends

I am the Santa Fe, Mandalay and Orlando and Colorado and Columbine
All combined into one, I don't walk a line, bitch, I run
'Cause we don't got no time to waste, so come on Denaun
Here come me, 5-to-9 and Thought, da-dun, da-dun
Then like a shotgun I'm ready to cock it on 'em
Leave these pussies stretched out like the Octomom
Never had no trouble keepin' up with the times
I just adapt to the climate, I treat it like my Levi's
When they ain't buttoned up right, I adjust on the fly
Middle fingers, put 'em high, that's why they call it a bird
'Cause you put it up in the sky
And I'm like a spider crawlin' up your spinal column
I'm climbin' all up the sides of the asylum wall
And dive in a pile of Tylenol, you're like a vagina problem
To a diabolical gynecologist tryna ball a fist, I will
Fuck you, just buy me, double timing the rhyming
I leave you stymied, that's why they still vilify me like Bill O'Reilly
I'ma show you what I mean when they call me the Harvey Weinstein of 2019
I'm a conniving, when I'm on the mic, I'ma stand out
Like a lime green wife beater with a knife out
I'm a sight to see, but you can see from the ring I'm wearing
Me and this game, we got married already
Had the prenup ready, fucked on her, should've seen her belly
She barely was three months pregnant
Bitch had it, gave me a baby, we named it Machine Gun Kelly
Now here's to LL, Big L and Del
K-Solo, Treach, and G Rap
DJ Polo, Tony D, ODB, Moe Dee, Run-DMC
Ed O.G., and EPMD, D.O.C., Ice-T, Evil Dee
King Tee, UTFO, and Schoolly D, PE, and BDP
YZ and Chi-Ali, Rakim and Eric B., they were like my therapy
From B.I.G. and Paris, Three Times Dope, and some we'll never see, and PRT
N.W.A and Eazy-E, and D-R-E was like my GPS
Without him, I don't know where I'd be"
Kanye West	5	Highlights	The Life of Pablo	2016	[Verse 1]	"Can we play that back one time?
And after that night, I'm gon' wanna play this shit back, oh no
Sometimes, I'm wishin' that my dick had GoPro
So I could play that shit back in slow mo
I just shot an amateur video; I think I should go pro, go"
Common	22	Real People	Be	2005	[Verse 2]	"I wonder if the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie
Watch me as the cops be tryna and pop and lock me
They cocky, plus they mentality is Nazi
The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi
We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs
We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge
They say the dope game is sour
Now they doin' homework that's when they follow you for hours
Come to your crib and devour all that you work for
Must be more than paper these niggas hurt for
Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays
Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality
Heard that it's drama at home
Can a dude break free and still get honoured at home?
I was told by a chief it's the games nature
When you're glowin' some will love and some will hate ya
It's real people"
Scarface	11	Heaven	The Fix	2002	[Verse 2]	"Listen to different scriptures, they teach on God
And if you ain't never met him, don't speak on God
I'm serious about religion, this shit's ain't no song
I'm hearing niggas makin' up scriptures, and playing along
Probably saying I'm the hypocrite, for judging these folks
But you can tell he ain't a Christian, by the way that he spoke
I pray for everybody, hoping that they hear that voice
The one that paralyzes you from head down, boy
When you're aware of your surroundings, yet you still can't move
Water shooting outta your eyes you hear this dude
And the voice is much louder, than the voice that you
Thought was the voice of the holy spirit
Gon' change your life when you hear it
And the next morn', you wake up and the world look lighter
The grass greener, and the sun brighter
I know the feeling first hand, I witnessed the sights
When I allowed the Lord to come in my life and it was like
Heaven, but I'm a man, I ain't perfect
That's a poor excuse, that ain't working
I asked him for forgiveness, for every sin I commit
Hopefully he gonna let me stay on his list
And trying and get to heaven"
Rakim	10	Guess Who’s Back	The 18th Letter	1997	[Verse 3]	"My rhymes and lyrics find spirits like a seance
Since fat crayons, I write and display chaos
My plan is damage, the diagram to where the jam is
I take advantage until the crowd go bananas
What a rush! I hear cuts and I lust to touch
Microphones be clutched by the illustrious
Word spread, I inherited many ways to say the unsaid
Born with three 7's in my head
In time, no one can seem to blow your mind as far as this
To find, you'll need philosophers and anthropologists
Astrologists, professors from your smartest colleges
With knowledge of scholarships, when Ra be droppin' this
Some of the things that I know will be in your next bible
When I die, go bury me and my notebook in Cairo
With the great God from Egypt, manifest, was writin' rhymes
Align with the stars, I come back to bless the mic"
Sleepy Brown	29	Peaches	Idlewild	2006	[Chorus]	"Stages in life, no one said that it was right
But I've got to hustle for the kids
God only knows where I've gone and been
'Til we reach the end
Just stay strong and be a friend"
Snoop Dogg	0	Snoop’s Upside Ya Head	Tha Doggfather	1996	[Verse 3]	"It takes a whole lot to be number one
I can't walk down the street without my gun
I can't trust these niggas, fool, It ain't no fun
I'm sittin' up in court 'cause somebody got dumb
What really counts is how the crowd bounce
Go home and say ""Snoop rocked the party""
Nobody got killed is what got announced
I guess they got a chance to see Dr. Bombay
But I keep my heat in case niggas get cold
Warm you up with the sheet
Zip you up and roll
Now, Doggystyle Records is now official
Gettin' money at the Pliz-ate with my initials
Shippin' records overseas, I'm makin' G's
With who you may call enemies
But I see nothing funny about makin' money
'Cause, uh, we all know it don't grow on trees
So I gotta get what I gotta get when I can
Up early in the mornin' wit' the Gap Band
Burning rubber down to get a new car
So don't get jealous when you see me in the Double R"
Eminem	15	Same Song & Dance	Relapse	2009	[Verse 2]	"The first victim I had, she was a big one
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab every four-to-six months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
At Nickelodeon, flashed the little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in, son
Look, here she comes, I better pull out the big guns
""Hello, Lindsay, you're looking a little thin, hun
How 'bout a ride to rehab? Get in, cunt!""
But starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
""Girl, I'm just kidding, let me start over again, hun
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension
You little wench, ya, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you, it would've already been done""
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her with 66 inches of extension cord"
Kanye West	5	The New Workout Plan	The College Dropout	2004	[Interlude]	"Hi, my name is Jill, I just want to say thanks to Kanye's workout plan. I was able to pull a NBA player. And, like, now I shop every day on Rodeo Drive. I just want to say, thank you, Kanye! Woooo! Woooo!—Woooo!
My name is Lasandra, and I just want to say that since listening to Kanye's workout tape, I was able to get my phone bill paid, I got sounds and 13's put up in my Cavalier and I was able to get a free trip to Cancun. And what's most importantly is that I ain't gotta fuck with Ray-Ray's broke ass no mo'

My name is Ella-May from Mobile, Alabama, and I just want to say since listening to Kanye's workout tape, I been able to date outside the family, I got a double wide, and I rode a plane—rode a plane—rode a plane
Thanks to Kanye's workout plan

See, I pulled me a baller man
And I ain't gotta work at the mall again"
Dr. Dre	1	Loose Cannons	Compton	2015	[Outro]	"Baby, baby! What the fuck are you doing? Put the gun down! Really? Are you doin' this shit to me again?
Oh my God

Wait, wait, wait, wait! Okay, I'm sorry! What the fuck? Don't point the fuckin' gun at me! Okay, put the fuckin' gun down! No, no, no, no!!

You gotta get under her armpits, man
Shut the fuck up, I got it
What the, what the fuck did you guys do?
It was this nigga
Me?
Shit, matter of fact you know what? You gon' dig the fuckin' hole this time
I don't give a fuck, like it's the first fuckin' hole I ever dug
Who the fuck is that?
I don't know, ask fuckin' Charles Manson right here
Oh, oh, you're tryna be funny? You're really fuckin' tryna be funny right now?
Shh, shh, shut your ass up
This is bad. This is, this is fucking bad man. Fuck it, let's start digging"
Nas	9	Black Girl Lost	It Was Written	1996	[Chorus]	"Diamonds all shining, looking all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl struggling, trying to survive 
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playing the same ol' games
Messing with my mind, emotional thangs "
Future	30	Where Ya At	DS2	2015	[Chorus]	"Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn't feed me?

Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out"
JAY-Z	6	Encore	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 3]	"So this here is the victory lap
Then I'm leavin', that's how you get me back
After a year of them 16's, it's 1.2
And that's 2.4, and I'm only doin' 2
You want in the game? Attention, new dudes
I can get you BET, and TRL, too
You want to be in the public, send your budget
Well, fuck it, I ain't budgin'
Young did it to death, you gotta love it
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it
Now look at me: all star-studded
Golfer above par like I putted
All ‘cause the shit I uttered was utterly ridiculous
How sick is this?
You want to bang, send Kanye change
Send Just some dust, send Hip a grip
Then you gotta spit a little somethin' like this"
Dr. Dre	1	Real Niggaz (LP Version)	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Verse 6]	"All these niggas with the jibber jabber
But couldn't kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer
Gangstas in black are out there
But only because, yo, it's the shit we wear
On my muthafucking dick
But I'm a love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick
So, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead
You get a muthafucking bullet in your forehead"
Common	22	Real Nigga Quotes	One Day It’ll All Make Sense	1997	[Verse 3]	"R&B studs kill me with they hardcore ballads
Love songs is violent, them niggas whole style is silent (Uh)
I hate to staple the singers together (What?)
But in my head it's been ringing forever
And a day if you grew up on Marvin Gaye
While all you singers booty this and freak me baby, it gets me
Emcees be insecure, like them little ho niggas immature wearing bobs
If I got a show in your town, I'm there with mob
Bukeing niggas and pulling broads is they apparent job"
Rakim	10	Stay a While	The 18th Letter	1997	[Chorus]	"Why don't you, stay a little while
Stay, stay a little while, child
Baby, why don't you, stay a little while
Stay, ayyyayyy, stay a little while, child
Baby, why don't you"
Rakim	10	The 18th Letter (Always and Forever)	The 18th Letter	1997	[Verse]	"Just when things seem the same, and the whole scene is lame
I come and reign with the unexplained for the brains 'til things change
They strain to sling-slang, I'm trained to bring game
History that I arranged been regained by King James
Go to practice with tactics, when the track hits, theatrics
Women that look like actresses, the status of Cleopatra's
Stacks of mathematics to feed yo' Asiatics
As I find out, what the facts is, for Geographic
No time to sip Mo's with hostess, never mind what the total gross is
I rip shows, stay focused, and split cheese with soldiers
While you hit trees and coast, I spit flows that be ferocious
And with these explosives, I split seas for Moses
Shine permanently, only my mind's concernin' me
Fire burns in me eternally, time's eternity
Followers turn on me, they'll be in a mental infirmary
Determinedly advance technology better than Germany
Since the first days you know of, 'til the last days is over
I was always the flow-er, I made waves for Noah
From a compound to the anatomy, to the breakdown of a atom
Some of my rap patterns still surround Saturn
From the ancient hieroglyphics to graffiti painted pictures
I study, I know the scriptures, but nowaday, ain't it vicious?
Date back, I go beyond, check the Holy Qu'ran
To speeches at the Audobon, now we get our party on
So bein' beneficent, I bless 'em with dialogue
They expectin' the next testament by the God
I roam through battle zones with chrome for chaperone
Blast beat with saxophones, one of the baddest rappers known
Every country, city and borough, side-street and ghetto
Island, alley and meadow, theory's thorough enough to echo
When it was one mass of land with one nat' of man
And the whole mass was ran under one master plan
Since the world's metamorphis and the planet's kept in orbit
Turntables, we spin awkward but needles never skip off it
Rhythms we expressin' similar to our ancestors
It'll answer your questions if you understand the message
From the days of the slave topics to the new age of prophets
As heavy as hip-hop is, I'm always ready to drop it
From the mind which is one of Allah's best designs
And mines'll stand the test of time when I rhyme"

When the cops came, you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, ""Yeah,"" shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged—plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry nines
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove (One what?) One love!"
JAY-Z	6	Change Clothes	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 2]	"And I ain't gon' tell you again, let's get ghost in the Phantom
You can bring your friend, we can make this a tandem
Or you can come by yourself if you can stand him
Best believe, I sweat out weaves
Give Afro Puffs like R-A-G-E
Hard you get if could move it
Back it on up like a U-Haul truck
Then run and tell them ducks you heard Hovi new shit
He and the boy Phar-real make beautiful music
He is to the East Coast what Snoop is
To the West Coast, what 'Face is to Houston
Young Hov' in the house is so necessary
No bra with that blouse, that's so necessary
No panties and jeans, that's so necessary
Now why you fronting on me, is that necessary?
Do I, to you, look like a lame
Who don't understand a broad with a mean shoe game
Who's up on dot dot dot and Vera Wang
Ma are you insane? Let's just

2Pac	18	Against All Odds	The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory	1996	[Verse 2]	"I heard he was light-skinned, stocky, with a Haitian accent
Jewelry, fast cars and he's known for flashin' (Say his name)
Listen while I take you back and lace this rap
A real live tale about a snitch named Haitian Jack
Knew he was workin' for the feds
Same crime, different trials, nigga, picture what he said and did I mention?
Promised to payback, Jimmy Henchman, in due time
I know you bitch niggas is listenin', the world is mine
Set me up, wet me up, niggas stuck me up
Heard the guns bust, but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine, on everything I own
I'll destroy everything you touch, play the game, nigga
All out warfare, eye for eye
Last words to a bitch nigga: ""Why you lie?""

Here we come, gunshots to Tut, now you stuck
Fuck the rap game, nigga, this M.O.B
So believe me, we enemies, I go against all odds"

From British Walkers and Argyles
Look at us rap stars now, with our black cars now
Fortune 500 listed, brunches, Cipriani's
Sippin', blunted, with rich white guys around me
Thick white girls around me, Chinese lined up
Because I'm what? Every dime lust
We used to be a ghetto secret; can't make my mind up

They say ""life is a game,"" so I play hard
Writin' for my life 'cause I'm scared of a day job
They say ""Sef kept the hood together""
I tell the young, ""We can't play the hood forever""
Play my cards right, they say I went too left
They showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F
Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights
Now I claim ""King"" like Don, or Frank White
They say my life is comparable to Christ
The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice
They say ""The crochet pants and the sweater was wack""
Seen the corner, now they say ""That nigga's back,"" uh"

Or will it know to beat the odds regardless of its skin tone?
Or will it feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on?
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone?
They alienate us 'cause we different keep your hands to the sky

And can you please put your titties closer to the 22s?
And where's the champagne? We need champagne
Now look as hard as you can with this blunt in your hand
And now hold up your chain, slow-motion through the flames
Now cue the smoke machines and the simulated rain
But not too loud cause the baby's sleeping
I wonder if it knows what the world is keeping
Up both sleeves while he lay there dreaming
Me and my robot tip-toe 'round, creeping
I had to turn my back on what got you paid
I couldn't see, had the hood on me like Abu Ghraib
But I'd like to thank the streets that drove me crazy
And all the televisions out there that raised me

Kendrick Lamar	16	King Kunta	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 1]	"The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)"
Nas	9	Represent	Illmatic	1994	[Verse 2]	"Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moët drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up bless
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
‘Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, buddha-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TECs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heines and Beck's"
Prodigy	8	Tres Leches (Triboro Trilogy)	Capital Punishment	1998	[Verse 1]	"Yo, disperse from off this, who the culprits
That claim to be the newest, rappin' bullshit
My rhymes get Ruger endorsements
My song boost Intratec sales through the ceiling
Let's talk with guns, convos 'til the po-lice come
Give you a red shirt with the wet hat to match
Burst macs like it's Hamburger Hill for real
It's Red Dawn when the Mobb get it on
My outfit stuck on some wild out shit, all about it
We move gambit through the overcrowded
Forthwith, pull out long fifths, extended clips
Point the nozzle and shift your back disk
Me and the clique-ah sit down and eat dinner
Wake up every mornin', write a new banger
That strike harder than your best attempt to sound like P
Or the H-A-V-O-C, nigga"

Ain't tryna be cool with no rap nigga, I'm fuckin' they ho, dawg

Guru	20	The Militia	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 2]	"Yo; I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, 'til everybody knows
That I got more flows than Rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
Til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
For big stacks, watch your back when I send em in
Caught you tremblin', my name and face you're rememberin'
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin'
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
That I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded Glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin'
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya
The war's on, that's why we formed The Militia"
2Pac	18	Can U Get Away	Me Against The World	1995	[Verse 2]	"Could it be my destiny to be lonely?
Ain't checkin' for these hoochies that be on me
‘Cause they phony
But you was different, I got no need to be suspicious
‘Cause I can tell, my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
I'm sittin' here hopin' that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits, gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance when it's my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses when he ain't lookin'
Now your heart's tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow
Come see tomorrow
Hopin' I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care – that someone's there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, no time to waste
We can hook up at the store. Can you get away?"

Eminem	15	’Till I Collapse	The Eminem Show	2002	[Verse 2]	"Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it, 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, JAY-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney—Nate, hit me!"

Pigs be fucking with a nigga for no reason
You're just getting home from work
And gotta get searched and treated like dirt by a fucking jerk
Niggas in the streets got tough luck
First they get cuffed up, then get roughed up, and that's fucked up
This every day, not every other week
Listen when this brother speak
Motherfuck turning the other cheek or you'll be layin' in a pine box
Bad enough they got .38s, now them clowns gettin nine Glocks
I'm not only fed up with the cops
I'm also fed up with them punk-ass cab drivers who don't stop
They don't care if it's snowing
First they slow down, then they see your skin is brown, then they keep going
'Cause I wasn't white, the cab took flight
But I caught him at the light and put a bullet right through his windpipe
I keep a tool with a full clip, the trigger I pull quick

""Juicy"" had us feelin like we was from New York
And that's real shit, blazed the Philly
It's ""Summertime"", shout out to Will Smith
Cause who didn't wanna be the Fresh Prince?
Flat top, gold chain and some fresh kicks
My nigga Nas told me ""Money Make the World go Round""
And Uncle Luke showed me how to make my girl go down
I've been around Hip Hop since '85
She had her ups and downs but she stayed alive
I used to think LL stood for ""Love LA""
He from Queens, how the fuck he put that with Cool J?
Red Kangol hat, red sweatsuit to match
Red Adidas, nigga, Game is back"

And just like that, it was only gettin', got they feelings hurt
Tell me how that sound? They got fed up with the biggest question mark
They curious now
'Cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand
To lend each other, uncover emotions when lights dim
So when she telling her to come over, it'll be alright
The minute she hit the block and turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they go"

Brought forth from a fifth of Hennessy
As in times of '89 they envision me
Warm days and the cold beer chemistry
Eventually, broken up by responsibilities and such
Sometimes, this era mentally I reconstruct
High school I came out it
Cats with clout at graduation got they name shouted
Go to Great America, me and my lady rock the same outfit
My niggas be fuckin' girls that she hang out with
Round then Guy came out with, 'Piece of My Love'
Arguin' over if he said, ""Dumb bitch""
Everyday the same old with rainbow, watchin' the sun twist
Cool as a Mig Dry, that in the trunk shit
Afterparties in Wendy's parkin' lot
Unfamiliar faces got marked a lot
Showin' off for hoes in bricks and rows had us charged to box
That demo sorta stopped once A.C. got popped"

Once The Man got to her, he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs, lookin' rock and dressin' hippie
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talkin' about poppin' Glocks, servin' rocks and hittin' switches
Now she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches
Always smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk
Tellin' me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin' how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it, but I'm committed
(Girl, he's committed) But so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same, lettin' all these goofies do her
I see niggas slammin' her, and takin' her to the sewer

Gon' peep behind now, I could feel the vibe out
They swear they know the truth, but still, niggas ride out
I see my hitters on my live, gotta log out

Then he played ping pong with his own ding-dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawnmower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
Everything 'cept his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw?"" Yeah, maniac, that's Shady, dawg

Faithful walks I take in the woods, thinking what's good
Things that I can change I should
Things I can't, need to be understood
Th-this is the bliss, I used to drift from the hood
For a second at least, I'm resurrecting the peace
Pipes that Indians used to light, we called it Chief, right?
Stepping on the leafs right to reach heights
Th-th-th-that I never seen, it's so so evergreen
Some use it for medicine, or to write better things
I was in Amsterdam man, bike pedalling
To the nature spot to taste the flavors they got
My eyes drop, I like it a lot

Blast out the pockets of coats
Make the cops boat
I break down your whole background yo
Irons, a permanent press, your clothes soakin'
You feel the shots pain every heartbeat throbbin'
Don't get excited you'll only make it worse fighting

And my Bentley bumpin' Prince shit, this is When Doves Cry
This is what it sounds like when hollow-tip slugs fly
Homie, this is something you can ride and smoke to
Stay on point, 'cause niggas will ride and smoke you
Jealousy's for women, but some niggas is bitch-made
They make you wanna run across they head with a switchblade
They point the finger at me, saying I'm bugged
My flow's crack, you listen, your fucking brain's on drugs
Look, ice drippin' on my neck, hands gripping on a TEC
Fool tripping, threw a set, you can get your ass wet
Cards messing up my deck, screws loose show respect
You try to come at me kid, your ass better come correct"

Kanye West	5	FML	The Life of Pablo	2016	[Verse 1]	"I been waiting for a minute
For my lady
So I can't jeopardize that for one of these hoes
I been livin' without limits
As far as my business
I'm the only one that's in control
I been feeling all I've given
For my children
I will die for those I love
God, I'm willing
To make this my mission
Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
I been thinking
'Bout my vision
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul
My soul
The layers to my soul
Revealing the layers to my soul"
Lupe Fiasco	23	The Coolest	Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool	2007	[Verse 2]	"And so began our reign
The Trinity: Her and I, Caine
No weatherman could ever stand when her and I came
Hella hard; umbrella, whatever, put plywood over Pella panes
And pray to God that the flood subside
'Cause you gon' need a sub 'til he does reply
And not one of Jared's, you think it's all arid
And everyt'ing's irie, another supply
That means another July inside my endless summer
That was just the eye of the Unger—Felix
'Cause he is the cleanest amongst the
Younger outstanding achieving up-and-comers
The ones that had deadbeat daddies and well-to-do mommas
But not well enough to keep 'em from us
The ones that were fighting in class, who might not pass
Rap record-pressured to laugh at a life not fast
""Can you feel it?"" That's what I got asked
""Do I love her?"" Said, ""I don't know""
Streets got my heart, game got my soul
One time missing sunshine will never hurt your soul
Quote to a crying, dishonored baby mama
Who's the mama to a daughter that I had fathered from afar
My new lady gave me a Mercedes
And a necklace with a solid gold key like the starter of a car
The opener of a door, or two pounds of raw
You gave me a baby, but what about lately?
Then ha-ha-ha-ha-ha'd, right up in her face, G
There's more fish in the sea, I'm on my mission to be, be"

And at the time your heart feel down and broke like Achy Breaky
Lump in your throat, feel like a trachea, oh dummy
The pain that's in your chest done made it's way down to your tummy
You wide open, you start smokin' with your girl
She nigga-bashin', sayin', ""You don't need em in your world, niggas all dogs!""
If niggas all dogs, then what you call broads?
Felines in heat, meowin for some yarn balls
Now you and her done got to drankin'
Oh now it's really crunk, cause y'all silly drunk and your girl done got to thinkin'
She talkin bout, ""Girl you look so beautiful""
You say, ""thank you,"" bein' nice, you try to change the subject
Want some beans and rice? But she's back at you like a pit
Mixed with a chihuahua, how much meaner can you get?
Don't let her have her way with you, she's gonna have a fit
You're the candy apple of her eye and bout to get bit
Here's what you do -- you
Grab her by her neck, throw her on the wall
Say, ""Bitch don't ever disrespect me, never not at all""
These simple words can put a pause to half of the applause
Then black ball laws of balance at all cost"

Let the streets be the court, and corners hold the trial
Fatal, not fictitious, I rock the cable, '86 shit
Foreign cars, young with crazy bitches
Mad smoke makes me able to quote
Solicitin' ill editions of that murder I wrote
A provocative plan can bring a knot to my hand
As the pyramids that stand on the top of the sand
In the heat of the moment, like Farrakhan said, we need atonement
Bulletproof glass, S-classes
Chrome kitted up, calicones lit it up
I didn't get touched, checkin' my nuts, I stood up and lit a Dutch
Clutchin' gats, quick to bust
But knowin' how these niggas tattle
I sneak-move, get the drop, one shot without the gun battle
So when you run, the lead travels
I come through, it's taboo
Ninety-six ways made to clap you"

Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off

And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn

Everything's calculated and sound precise
Another move another mill', let's get right a'ight?
Success is my drug of choice, I'm high off life
Feelin' lucky enough to bet it all on the dice

Override lies and the laws of nations
Pilgrims bear witness at all the stations
Sun positions overcome traditions
Numbers govern our young religions
Dead levels making plumb decisions
Perpendicular to the undivision
That's bad curricular to the unconditioned
Any love less than unconditional is so
Under-Christian, it's unrepentant
The physical part of my church
Emits the invisible arts of my work
To make gold from garbage
Is not the alchemical point of this math
But truth be told it's the pursuit of gold
That turns the goal of men into trash
The soul's gold and they turning gold into cash
And your reflection is your connection
To more collections of more directions and paths
If your reflection is a mask, then you're reflective of mass
To see yourself just look at me then split your reflection in half"

And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time (Ahh-! Ahh-ahh-!)
'Cause I'm Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, NSYNC, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
'Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (Ahh!)
So I just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
'Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy, you know this
I'm sorry, Puff, but I don't give a fuck
If this chick was my own mother, I'd still fuck her with no rubber
And cum inside her and have a son and a new brother
At the same time and just say that it ain't mine—what's my name?"

I be thinking about the good old days when I was a whippersnapper
Used to try to get a kiss, but now it be them drawers I'm after
I'm just a Southernplayalistic pimp
I used to sling a fat rock, but now I'm serving hemp
I never even smoked a crumb of crack, but yo, I'm dope
More doper than a junkie or a Pookie 'cause it's on
So each one teach one, I be claiming true
To East Point and College Park and the things I used to do
Around ATL, home of the pimps and the money makers
Club Nikki's, Magic City, and them Southern players
I never said I was a gangster, but I will do you

And two is for the sound, hootie-hoo, that I make"

Where my hustlers, where my boosters at?

I know the world glued your back to the wall
You gotta brawl, do that

Gotta keep a peace like a Buddhist

Take notes, nigga, best check the index
Look over anything that you might've missed
You overlooked the part with some unified terrorists
Pirates, straight off the ship and mad starvin'
Anchored to land and now we runnin' wild, poundin'
On imbecile niggas who ain't got they feet grounded
Precise, astonishin' shots split your skin's top
We sent pops, catch you from two blocks
Don't run up on you chargin', with hot shit, he felt it, alarmin'
Shockin', surprisin' shit, left you crawlin'
Dangerous, huh, and ready to rock
This man's hot, your flesh start to boilin' hot
Rhymes solid like a lead pipe that bleeds your knot
Knot-headed niggas get knocked out a lot
Kick down your chain-locked door, we raise spot
My clique got a deadbolt lock, you rather not, dude
Stormin' through the crowd, part the sea, comin' through
Spill my over-proof, it's drippin' from my temple
Lay on the wall and watch all y'all
You can't injure a ninja who crept and took fall
Surrounded by crime cats, time for tap jaws
Leave red stains on clothes, carpets, and floors"
Rakim	10	It’s Been a Long Time (Suave House Mix)	The 18th Letter	1997	[Verse 2]	"When I'm out propping - either hanging or shopping
People see me stop and ask me when the album dropping
The wait is over, in formation like a soldier
Like I told ya, greater stronger, now that I'm older
I broke the, code of silence with overloads of talents
My only challenge, is not to explode in violence
I'm Asiatic, and blazing microphones a habit
At least once during the course of a day, it's automatic
In ghetto apparel, mind of a Egyptian Pharoah
Far from shallow, thoughts travel like an arrow
Allah's monotony, so far they can't stop me
You know, Ra want property like Mumar Khadafi
More thoughts than Bibles, recital - taught disciples
A sawed off mic, so words scatter like a rifle
Thoughts that's trifle, I'm busting these for you
Aiyyo, technical difficulties is through"

Hollow tips make niggas disappear like Houdini
Gangbangin' is real, homie—I'm living proof
Like Snoop Dogg C-walkin' on top of the Devil's roof
Rap critics wanna converse about this and that
'Cause red strings in his Converse, and this a Dre track
Keep gibberin' and jabbin', I pull the .38 Magnum
And get to clickin' and clackin'
Your homies wanna know what happened
Come to Compton, see Thriller like Mike Jackson
I might be Spike Lee of this gun-clappin'
Prior to rappin', I was drug traffickin'
In the dope spot, playing John Madden
Homie, I ain't braggin', I took five
You wanna die? Run up on that black 7-45"

From the way she was blowin', I know she does it a lot

He just started hittin' me harder
God, I wish I could just jaw him

This prick is bigger than I am
But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
I'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time
Sneak up with a lethal injection
And put him down like they did to my dog
I'm talkin' euthanasia (Euthanasia), like kids in Taiwan
This fuckin' shit's like Saigon (Saigon)
Neighbors called police on him

As the minutes go by, you 'bout to get it, know why?
I'm already in too deep, so forget it, don't try
Cause all you gonna find is sufferin and pain
I had enough of you man, I'm 'bout to fuck up your plan
So speed on, before you get peed on
All I need is more power, then I'mma put the squeeze on"
Kanye West	5	Addiction	Late Registration	2005	[Chorus]	"Why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man, I tried to stop, man, I tried the best I could
But "
Eminem	15	Cleanin’ Out My Closet	The Eminem Show	2002	[Verse 1]	"Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!"
Kendrick Lamar	16	A.D.H.D	Section.80	2011	[Verse 2]	"And then she started
And then she started feelin' herself like no one else in this apartment
""Beg your pardon? Oh, I rap, baby, how old are you?""
She say twenty-two, I say twenty-three, ""Okay, then we are crack babies,"" damn
""Why you say that?"" She said, ""Where my drink at?""
""I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax""
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen, Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside, then she said, ""Read between the lines,"" yep
Hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up when the Nuvo start to drown
Her body, and I know the both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound (Woah)
Of that Bay Area kush, she looked at me, then looked
At it, then she grabbed it, then she said, ""Get it understood""
""You know why we crack babies? Because we born in the '80s
The ADHD crazy"""
Eminem	15	Say What You Say	The Eminem Show	2002	[Verse 3]	"Huh, like my old lady?
‘Cause what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean
Is two different things, depending on your mood if it swings
Think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything
Catch a contact and I'm gone, and I'm back
I speed write and my loose leaf's my launchpad
And it's back and forth all day, like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth, but a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend, I'ma die a sudden death
Five mics in ? Ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath
But I'll suffocate for the respect 'fore I breathe to collect a fuckin' check"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Hi-Definition	Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool	2007	[Verse 1]	"And my return (yeah!) is more like a re-up
I hold a whole like a tea-cup
World in one hand, while the other hand throw the peace up
My other hand throwing ""We"" without the e up (Westside)
I got like five more, man, I'm something like Shiva
In that Fall of Rome Number Four Deluxe
See, I've been around the world like the gnome
But I come from a zone where the homes are beat up
The folks, unknowns, and the stones all meet up
Police tap my phone, got my songs on speaker
Say he spat the poems, got their domes all geeked up
To get up on they thrones and become young leaders
Oprah put it on my culture, now, if that ain't wrong
Imus got it from the rhymers, now, if that ain't blown
They gave my man forty-four, now, if that ain't long
I put it all on my shoulders, now, if that ain't strong
I made it out alive from the streets of the west side C-H-I
Now, if that ain't home, you better tell 'em"

We can keep an AP on when we do it (Do it)
You can keep your Rollie on when I get to it (To it)
You can keep your Rollie on when I get to it (Come on)
When you look down, see my chains on (Chains on)
When you look down, see my chains on (I got it on)
When you're ridin' on me, see my chains on (Ridin' on)

2Pac	18	Heavy in the Game	Me Against The World	1995	[Verse 1]	"Now, how can I explain how this game laced me?
Plus with this fame, I got enemies do anything to break me, my attitude changed
Got to the point where I was driven
24/7 money's my mission, just a nigga tryna make a livin'
These busta tricks don't want no mail
They spendin' they riches on scandalous bitches who'll stay petrified in jail
It's hell, plus all the dealers want a meal ticket
Jealous-ass bitches, player-hatin', but we still kick it
Always keep my eyes on the prize, watch the police
Seen so much murder, neighborhoods gettin' no sleep
But still, I get my money on major, continuously
Communicatin' through my pager, niggas know me
Don't have no homies since they jealous, I hustle solo
'Cause when I'm broke, I got no time for the fellas, listen
Ain't nothin' poppin' 'bout no broke nigga, I ain't no joke
Fuck what they say and get your dough, nigga

Had a fake gold chain, but don't nobody else knows
That ain't the type of shit I'm made of
That ain't the type of shit I'm made of
Snitchin' on my homeboy, gossipin' bout old boys
Keep buyin' them Ferraris cause I grew up with no toys
That ain't the type of shit I'm made of
That ain't the type of shit I'm made of
I'm just trying to get my weight up
I'm just trying to get my weight up

Big Homies drivin' by, tellin' me to stay up
How the fuck I'm 'posed to stay up?

I just seen Mac Dre bruh
And the Jacka, is we up in the Bay bruh?

Until you recognize, what my rapture can do
You thought I wouldn't step up, to keep my rep up?
I ain't them other kids, I don't need to play no catch-up
I got too much pride for this, I know some niggas
That'll ride for this, with me it's do or die for this
Street knowledge, intellect and spirituality
My survival package, as I deal with reality
I'm like Fishburne in Hoodlum when I come to do 'em
Chew 'em up, spit 'em out, the most respected no doubt
You seen me in action so act like you've been knowin'
The G-U-R-U, of the Gang, I've been flowin'
Just like the river Niger all the way to the Hudson
Had so many lyrics stashed, and I couldn't wait to bust some
Lately, I've watched this game evolve and elevate
So now I push my music like drug dealers push weight
Straight like that, straight out the gate
'Cause it's never too late, to set this fuckin record straight
But it is too late, for you and your crew son
You had the audacity to come against me, the gifted one?
And Preemo with the tracks, to inspire my next line
You've got no wins here, so better luck next time"
Eminem	15	Evil Twin	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 2]	"So who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber?
Nah, F with Christina
I ain't fuckin' with either Jessica neither: Simpson or Alba
My album's just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve, or
Extra Strength Tylenol 3s
Feel like I'm burnin' to death, but I'm freezin'
Bedridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again, like the legend of Heath-uh-
Ledger, my suicide note's barely legible; read the
Bottom, it's signed by the Joker
Lorena said I never can leave her
She'll sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit, bitch! Give up my dick for pussy?
I'll be Jerry Mathers I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off tryna mess with a cleaver
Golly wolly, I vent, heat register, Jesus
Ever since 19946 Dresden it was definitely in my destiny
When on the steps, I met DeShaun at Osborn
I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap
Used to mop floors, flip burgers, and wash dishes
While I wrote rhymes, tryna get props for 'em
‘Cause I took book smarts and swapped for 'em
They were sleepin', I made 'em stop snorin'
Made 'em break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip hop in its tip-top form
Since N.W.A was blarin' through my car windows
Leanin' on the horn, screamin', ""Fuck the police,"" like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn
Fuck top five, bitch, I'm top four
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin
So who the fuck you think that third and that fourth spot's for?
And crazy as I am, I'm much tamer than him, and I'm nuts
Then again, who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that (Evil grin)
(Evil twin) please come in; what was your name again?
Hi! Faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear, and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney
Jeez, just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
‘Cause I'm so sick of bein' the truth
I wish someone'd finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh, LMFAO, no way, Jo-
-se Baez couldn't beat this rap—O.J., no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony, hey ho (Hey, ho)
I sound like I'm tryna sing the fuckin' chorus to ""Hip Hop Hooray""
No, I’m hollerin', you got bottom-end like an 8-0-8
And I (Base) whether we're fuckin' off that instead of your face so
Let your low-end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho? Slow dancin' or bowling?
You tryin' to hold hands with your homie?
What, you think I'm lookin' for romance ‘cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman try to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke, so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke ‘cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside, I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize'"
JAY-Z	6	December 4th	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 1]	"They say ""They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone.""
So on that note, I'm leavin' after this song
So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay, so long
But at least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree
Which makes me a more sicker MC, and my momma would claim
At 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here
She knows my purpose wasn't purpose; I ain't perfect, I care
But I feel worthless 'cause my shirts wasn't matchin' my gear
Now I'm just scratchin' the surface 'cause what's buried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted
Hold on"

My motto, ""You fuck with us, your fuckin' life gone""
Two days later, niggas came back and sprayed us
Retaliation and get-back this time just to face it
We five cars deep, we get out as we creep
Blowin' niggas' grill off, hollerin' Eastside Long Beach
My feud ain't with them other niggas, it's with you
Got a gauge to your head, nigga, what you gon' do?
Handle my business 'fore the cops come and they get to snitchin'
Reachin' to our destination so we can kick it
Nobody knows, then we won't get caught
Continue stackin' paper, movin' cavi' on the block
I thought you knew, but now you know
Don't ever, ever come around here no more
And why's that? And why not?
'Cause it's my money and I mash for my block, hah"
The Game	13	The Documentary	The Documentary	2005	[Verse 3]	"Let me tell you why I do this shit
I'm a son of a gun 'cause moms was a Hoover Crip
First day I got signed, I had to prove I spit
Freestyle with Busta Rhymes
The protégé of Doc Dre, I could finally put the shoes on
Now that the rumors of Rakim and Cube gone
They say truth hurts, sunk like quicksand
Don't stop me in traffic and ask about Hittman
I gotta restore the feelin' that crawled from under the rock
After Tha Dogg Pound crushed the buildings
I got a family to feed, I'm the middle of 9 children
We can talk about a loan after I sell 5 million
If I tell you I ain't Game and I don't know Dre
You goin' do me like Xzibit and cut half my face?
I take all the credit for puttin' the West back on the map
If you ain't feelin' that, guess I'm Guerrilla Black"

""Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!""
Damn, how much damage can you do with a pen?
Man, I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been

On an oversea flight now

But still, I got enemies giving me energy
I wanna fight now

Trevor's still locked up, Lake's gettin' his cheddar
Corey changed his name to ah, whatever
Cornchip, Buckwheat look-a-like, it's Mega
Right, Mega was his name, sorry about that

Always actin' tough, a jokester be frontin'

Still laughin' to the bank and shit
Back to Cor', got him a deal but his rhymes was wack
Def Jam mad that he signed the contract
Now he got jealous and mad at my shine
Making silly tapes, I'm always on his mind
Nonsense, not to be obnoxious, kid
Mega, for the record you could suck my dick
Bitch, you from around the way, it's sad what this do to me
But Queensbridge, we gotta have unity"

Nas	9	Can’t Forget About You	Hip Hop Is Dead	2007	[Verse 2]	"Can't forget about the old school, Bam, Caz, Melle Mel, Flash
Rocksteady spinnin on they back
Can't forget when the first rap Grammy went to Jazzy, Fresh Prince
Fat Boys broke up, rap hasn't been the same since
So irregular, how it messed you up
When Mr. T became a wrestler
Can't forget about Jordan's retirement
The shot Robert Horry hit to win the game in the finals kid
Some things are forever, some things are not
It's the things we remember that gave the world shock
They stay in a place in your mind so snug
Like who the person was with whom you first made love"
Nas	9	Money Over Bullshit	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Verse 1]	"My niggas got scarred grills, skully hats and gats be full-ies
Brrrat! Cars peel, the East Coast cartel
Rats get their tails snapped and trapped
The snitches in the streets and the snitches who rap
Pure euphoria, a dose of death to all of ya
Coroner choruses sung from The Bridge to Astoria
Dreams of falling in the elevator, passing floors
Suddenly stop, the doors open up to a brick wall
I can smell the haters, wishful thinkers, bad-luck prayers
Picture your tarot cards and bodyguards getting sprayed up
Sabotaging my makeup, my watches get laced up
Even if they indicted Jacob
Forensics, paramedics, carry cowards off
Defibrillators shock to your chest, try to cough
They die and hit Hell from an iron
I'm fly in YSL, I'm paid from this shit
Got bitches high as hell, and they fucking like AIDS don't exist
They get sent to your hotel, a maid in this shit
Put a barrel in a capo mouth 'til his scalp come out
You a kid, you don't live what you rap about
King poetic, too many haters to count
Too much paper to count (QB, bitch!)"
50 Cent	19	Many Men (Wish Death)	Get Rich or Die Tryin’	2003	[Verse 1]	"Now man, these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head
Go on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, somethin' special happened every time
I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles, I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around, gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
'Til I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over"
André 3000	27	Dracula’s Wedding	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse 2]	"I've never ran from no one, but I'm terrified of you

Eminem	15	Must Be the Ganja	Relapse	2009	[Verse 3]	"When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that you're tryna light
Behind the board sits Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say this is the way it should be?
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some
He can give her some, she can give them some
Get behind a LinnDrum, make up a beat and cure the sucker syndrome
The spinnin' drum when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some
Startin' from scratch and then endin' up at the ending of
Capable of winnin' a Pulitzer
So unbelievable, it's a titanium cranium that's full of sur–
–prises when the smoke rises right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos eyes
Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking"
Prodigy	8	Give Up the Goods (Just Step)	The Infamous	1995	[Verse 1]	"A-yo, Queens get the money, long time no cash
I'm caught up in the hustle where the guns go blast!
The fool retaliated, so I had to think fast
Pull out my heat first, he pull out his heat last
Now, who the fuck you think is livin' to this day?
I'm tryna tell these young niggas crime don't pay
They looked at me and said, ""Queens niggas don't play
Do your thing, I'll do mine, kid, stay outta my way""
It's type hard tryna survive in New York state
But can't stop 'til I'm eatin' off a platinum plate
Po-po comes around and tries to relocate me
Lock me up forever, but they can't deflate me
'Cause havin' cash is highly addictive
Especially when you're used to havin' money to live with
I pause, step back, look at my life as a whole
Ain't no love, it seems the devil done stole my soul
I'm out for delfia, selfia, P's not helpin' ya
I'm tryna get this Lexus up, plus a cellular
Yo, Big Noyd! (What up, cousin?!) I can't cope
With all these crab niggas tryna shorten my rope"

Nas	9	The Ghetto	The Documentary 2.5	2015	[Verse 1]	"It be jam-packed in front of the stoops in Siberia
Same way they are in the middle of Nigeria
Every part of the whole world, there's an area
That, if you're poor, another day alive is a miracle
The blocks in Watts got crooked cops that frame the innocent
No different from Flint, Michigan
Living in the D, checking in with the pimps and them
It's similar to O-Town, in the Southern Peninsula
Pretty city, skyscrapers will fool you, look through to
Inner cities the rich won't move to
The nice parts, they well-protected by a vanguard
The opposite of how these concentration camps are
Low-income housing, it dwells murderers
But children don’t qualify for health services
The bourgeois act like they don’t see starvations
Like they spraying Estée Lauder on sanitation"
Kendrick Lamar	16	A.D.H.D	Section.80	2011	[Verse 1]	"Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he feel today
You know when you part of Section.80
You feel like no one can relate
'Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with an 808 (A melody and some hoes)
PlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is Black, she Black too
Purple Label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head, then she look at me
She got ADHD"
Kendrick Lamar	16	How Much a Dollar Cost	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 3]	"Guilt trippin' and feelin' resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin'
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I'm kiddin'?
So I'ma tell you like I told the last bum
Crumbs and pennies, I need all of mines
And I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgment, I know when nigga's hustlin', keep in mind
When I was strugglin', I did compromise, now I comprehend
I smell Grandpa's old medicine, reekin' from your skin
Moonshine and gin, nigga, you're babblin', your words ain't flatterin'
I'm imaginin' Denzel but lookin' at O'Neal
Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre
The jig is up, I seen you from a mile away losin' focus
And I'm insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, ""Your potential is bittersweet""
I looked at him and said, ""Every nickel is mines to keep""
He looked at me and said, ""Know the truth, it'll set you free
You're lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the higher power
The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit
The nerve of Nazareth, and I'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss—I am God"""
The Game	13	Start From Scratch	The Documentary	2005	[Verse 1]	"If I could start from scratch, I wouldn't change shit
Same red bandana, same four-fifth
Same G-wagon, same hoodrat bitch
Workers in the kitchen cookin' up my shit
Same telephone booth, same connect
That mean the same hollow tips breakin' up in my chest
Same bloody t-shirt, same address
Same Dogg Food album banging in my tape deck
Homie, if I can make '94 today
I'd tell Eazy and Dre to bring back N.W.A
I would've told 'Pac not to stomp out Orlando
Told Puffy and Big about the Rampart scandal
I got too many dead homies, fuck a rap career
I'd give anything in the world to bring back my nigga Tear
Seem like we was just in Magic City yesterday
If I could bring back my homeboy Charles, he would say"

Run in your crib, no prisoners, pop your grandma
Locked in the slammer? Nope, popped up in Atlanta
Crossed up in a drop, I popped up the antenna
Whoa.. watch your manners when my veins pop like Scanners
Like raindrops, you hear the thunder when I cock the cannon
Big bang, big chains, ain't shit changed
Get brain in the four-dot-six Range
Shit, mayne, switch lanes
Every town I hit, switch planes
Bitch, flip big 'caine
Flow with no cut, you take it in vein to the brain
Muh'fuckas is noddin' and throwin' up
You know that you don't wanna owe that man
He'll hit ya, get the picture? Kodak, man
Got a love for war, I don't floss no more
I just sit on my money 'til I'm above the law
How the fuck you gon' stop us with your measly asses?
We don't stop at the tolls, we got E-ZPasses, nigga

Iceberg sweats with I.B. on the elastic"
Dr. Dre	1	Genocide	Compton	2015	[Verse 1]	"Murder this, murder listen, hear that Suburban whippin'?
Tinted windows, right at your wifey (Brrrat!)
And I bet you miss her
Reload the Pro Tools and we throw the clip in both trays
That's one on the left and one in the right hand
Scottie Pippen, both ways
Been doin' drive-bys
Got this music industry timeline lookin' like Rosecrans
When these niggas throw up them signs high
I'm talking about that bottom, where it's high crimes
Shit, I’m just tryna get paid and keep them thighs high (Thighs high)
Sometimes, I feel like I could just bury ‘em, bury 'em
Cause delirium, mass hysteria, no scarier area
I'm very aware hip-hop needed something to carry it
So I married that bitch and swung down in that chariot
And you way too fuckin' close, beware the barrier
This is Hub City, nigga, don't make us embarrass you
Man, you should be realistic, these niggas 'round here ballistic
We did the numbers, and you looking like another statistic"

John, where's Dave at? Before I bash you""
""He's in the bathroom, I think he's takin' a crap, dude""
""Dave, pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants, choppin' her hair off
And there's only two days left of Spring Break
How long do these things take to wear off?""
""Well, it depends on how many you had""

Substantial amounts you owe to the fam', crew
Firm affiliation, paper chasin'
Chips glossy, rich Pablo Escabano, sophisticado
Blazing hollows like Saddles
Rap apostle, nacho cheese, I'm Castro
Compared to these niggas who swear to be the real
But impostors to Hoffa, Nas plague kills
Countin' bills to send to all my jail niggas who fell
From New York to LA, QB to CPT for GP
A 100G cars, Garcia Vegas cigars
Kani shit, mad jiggy
The clout — murder material, serial scratched out
My name's passed out like it's somethin' venereal
But back in stereo"

Time to see, who's the G, with the bigger nuts
Buck buck, big up they're livin' reckless
Niggas with a death-wish step in with a TEC and I'll wet this
Yeah this shit is hyper
True to what I'm writing, representing and I'm striking like a viper
Huh, I got my mind made up, I got my nine
Ring the alarm, and strong-arm what's mine

I'm old fashioned, run up on me, nigga, and get blasted
With five deadly venoms"

And I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson, ‘cause it ain't about race now
Sometimes I think about my life, with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile 
Damn, I know his mama proud, and since you helped me sell my dream
We can share my mama now
And like M.J.B., no more drama now
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground

JAY-Z	6	Dirt Off Your Shoulder	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 1]	"I probably owe it to y'all, prolly be locked by the force
Tryna hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said, the ladies, they love me — from the bleachers, they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin' — they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers — they love it just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom to the ""Top of the Pops""
Nigga, London (Woo), Japan (Woo), and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back — get it, man? I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, ‘cause I'm straight with the Roc"
Kanye West	5	Still Dreaming	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Verse 1]	"He pulled up at 6:30 in a 745
As he waving ""Shorty, hi"", you know he showin' his bling out
She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out
His girl caught feelings, she mad, she threw the ring out
How she found out she dreamt the whole thing out
Y'all be going through problems, you gotta work the kinks out
When you go to sleep? What do you think 'bout?
If y'all get a divorce she gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out
Make it so cold that you gotta pull your mink out
Or grab your roller skates and turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle, meanwhile
She out doing the same thing now, nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out"

Scarface	11	Greed	My Homies	1998	[Verse 1]	"You claim your man done beat your ass in when he puts his hands on ya
You called the police, told the man you ain't goin'
So he's packin' up your shit and got your suitcase ready
Sittin' in the driveway beside your black Chevy
Got your whole family wired up to go in his place
But he don't give a fuck now, they showin' his face
You probably tried to play the good girl when you saw him today
But now you got him fucked up 'cause you all in his safe?
Whatever happened to the women like mama
Who fed the whole family with love and ten dollars?
A new day came and now your ho sack chasin'
So hungry for scratch, you hoes'll track down Jason
Don't get me wrong, I got respect for Black ladies
It's the ones who playin' dumb and the check for the babies
On theyself, lookin' lovely with they hair full of spritz
Double digit for your children and they dress 'em like shit
And all they gots to do now is collect it and smile
I figured bitches had a little more respect for they child
I guess they don't, and it makes even madder just thinkin'
These hoes can get the crib and the goddamn Lincoln
I know you hate me 'cause the truth hurts
Sit on your ass and receivin' the salary while the dudes work
Let's get for real because the world needs it
Twenty-five hundred dollars a child? Come on, the girl greedy"
Eminem	15	97' Bonnie & Clyde	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Verse 1]	"C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin' to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let Dada strap you in the car seat
Oh, where's Mama? She's takin' a little nap in the trunk
Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk
Now, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'
But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it (No)
And don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?
Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (Yeah)
And Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch, it don't hurt
Her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin'
And spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can play by ourselves, can't we?"

Eminem	15	Hello	Relapse	2009	[Verse 3]	"Oh, those were the days, they certainly were
It's hurting me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good
Word-word, chk-word-word, chk-word, chk-chk-word
I second that and I third, rushed to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
He's no longer getting them free—hundred bucks for these Percodans
Plus, it's getting to be where he'll lustfully search the den
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurtin' him
Tirelessly on the phone trying to rustle up
Muscle relaxers for his back and a couple of Paxils
Now he's doubling backwards, and he's stumbling back
Slipped and fell, hit his back, boom, heard something go crack
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just busting my own chops while I'm busting a rap
Resuscitated and rejuved, so fuck it, I'm back"

From killin' corrupt cops with motherfuckin' buck shots
So don't step to this, 'cause I got a live crew
You might be kinda big, but they make coffins yo' size, too
I was taught wise, I'm known to extort guys
This ain't Cali — it's Harlem, nigga, we do walk-by's
No one can match me, tax me, or wax me
If you want me to write you some raps, G, just ask me
'Cause on the shelf is where your LP cold stood
Because it was no good, that shit ain't even go wood
I'm not the type to take sluts out, I just fuck they guts out
Get my nuts out, then break the fuck out
Me bein' a virgin? That's idiotic
'Cause if Big L got the AIDS, every cutie in the city got it
Once a nigga tried to stick me for six G's
And I put more holes in his ass than Swiss cheese"
Guru	20	Nice Girl, Wrong Place	The Ownerz	2003	[Verse 2]	"What's a nice girl like you doing here like this?
Busting your heels like this, I know you feel like shit
And you feel like calling the quits, but you need that dough
Paying for school, I can see that yo
You're intelligent, similar to Angelou
I'm understanding you, I got big plans for you
Your whole awaistance got you going places
You chasing money, ain't no funny faces
You're/Your shit serious, niggas is delirious
I like your little outfit, I like the way you're wearin it
You say your last man was too jealous
You're too young to settle down, girl I'll let you tell it
You're not a video chick, not a groupie bitch
Just an ambitious young woman with juicy lips
Remembering your face like this, my Henney chase like this
What you doing in a place like this"

Once I pour in that Molly, I got her (I got her)
Got my neck and wrist on the Phantom (On God)

I appreciate the way you fuck me
We could never tell the fuckin' public

Get pierced like ten spears, shit is fierce
Fist, five and five, in multitudes
Comin' through bangin' the five
Shit hit ligaments.  Restructured, rewired

Let off a pellet, the Desert Eagle start yellin'
Screamin', the path of a demon bailin'
With my all blue Chucks on goin' out right
Dippin' through the back 'cause it's on onsite
The first nigga saw is the first nigga gone
Smashed on, banked and shanked and blast on
I make the bitches strip, we out 6-4's
Like e'erday, Californ-I-A
I can't explain it, the immaculate candy painted
Double-four dumper on my lap for comfort"

On the streets of L.A. wonderin' where the pussy at

Hangin' out, rollin' in my six-four
Sixteen switches for the niggas in my hood
Seventeen shells, so I make it understood
Stay back, lay back, way back in the cut
Ya come outside, nigga, ya gettin' fucked up
I done told ya, creep-creep, ya best move
Like Luther Vandross, I'm fuckin' up the west coast
I'm right back up in ya when ya nut

This is for the hoes that I used to know
When I didn't have my sixty-four and a lot of dough
I keep it like this and like that, and I"

You gon' back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Temperature risin', okay, let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam-packed, hot as a tea kettle
I'll break it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I got you
Wanna show me you could work it, baby? No problem
Get on top, then get to bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick
I'm tryin' to explain, baby, the best way I can
I'll melt in your mouth, girl, not in your hand, ha-ha"

Now as crazy as it is, you know this home for me
I wouldn't never leave it, you know that's wrong to me
I'ma stay down, you see me on the corners, G
At your local liquor store, gettin' some Optimos
And if I'm out of bounds then I gotta cock the fo'
Keep it on the low on the W-W-W-West coast
Sign some autographs and then I do get ghost
A-humph.. yeah, I love my folks
But half of y'all fools is cutthroats
On the real know the streets'll have you
Guide you, lead you, mislead you, it's fragile
Yeah, see you gradually grow
And when you walkin on my side I think you all need to know..."

Red rags in Uptown Harlem now, I need that love
Front court at the Knicks game, new chick, French name
New car, new house, and sometimes friends change
And you don't need that love, when you G's like us
And your Jesus piece is sim-u-lar to Biggie's
And your life story is sim-u-lar to 50's
First they hate you, then they love you, then they hate you again
What the fuck do it take for a gangsta to win?
No mics, no Unsigned Hype, nigga, fuck The Source
Plus them awards I don't need
And them niggas breathing the same air as me, acting like they don't bleed

I'm outside like I'm on patrol
I hear the zeitgeist, now I'm in the zone
You know they say you up when you finally free
It won't feel right if it's only me
If you're scared, nigga, say your grace
I got the formula like I own the race
I got the keys with me like I own the place
If these niggas on top, then I'm outta space

This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window — check yourself
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where **** hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all—duck""
That's what mama said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat

That's the mentality here (Here), that's the reality here (Here)
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me here? (Huh?)
While I'm holdin' a pistol with this many calibers here? (Here)
Plus a registration that just made this shit valid this year? (Year)
'Cause once I snap, I can't be held accountable for my actions

That B.C.B.G, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She's feeding fools' fantasies, they pay her 'cause they want her
I spit a little G-Man and my game got her
An hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear, saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar, trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga trying to holla 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla 'cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit the track, catch a date, and come pay the kid

You was a ballerina, I got the pictures, I seen ya
Then you dropped ""Shook Ones,"" switched your demeanor
Well, we don't believe you, you need more people
Roc-A-Fella students of the game, we passed the class
'Cause nobody can read you dudes like we do
Don't let 'em gas you like Jigga is ass and won't clap you
Trust me on this one, I'll detach you
Mind from spirit, body from soul
They'll have to hold a mass, put your body in a hole

Dead bodies are found throughout the town
Try to put shame in my game to make a name
I'ma put it on a bullet, put it in your brain
Rip the block like a buckshot, who cares where it goes?
Just keep the casket closed
No remorse when a life is lost
I paid my dues, paid the cost
And my pockets are still fat
Wherever I'm at, I get the welcome mat
Even if my crew is steep, I'm one deep
I attract attention, people like to peep
So come say hi to the bad guy
Don't say goodbye, I don't plan to die
'Cause I get loose and I got troops, and crazy juice
In control of many like Ayatollah Khomeini
Hang out with Smith and Wess', don't try to play me
I'm at war a lot like Anwar Sadat
But no warnin' shot, my gun is warm a lot
When I cook beef, the smoke will never clear
Areas in fear 'cause this here's severe
Livin' life too close to the edge
Hopin' that I know the ledge"

Suckers fantasizin' pictures of a young brother buried
Was it me, the weed or this life I lead?
If daytime is for suckers then tonight we breathe
Out for all that, knowin' that this world bring drawbacks
Look how they shiver once I deliver these raw raps
Meet me at the cemetery, dressed in black
Tonight we honor the dead, those who won't be back
So, if I die, do the same for me, shed no tears
An outlaw thug livin' in this game for years
Why worry? Hope to God, get me high when I'm buried
Knowin' deep inside only a few love me
Don't rush me to the gates of Heaven
Let me picture for a while, how I lived for my days as a child
I wonder now, how do we outlast?
Always get cash, stay strong if we all mash; hold ya head!"

But I take advantage and take you for granted
Call collect explainin' why I ain't came yet
I ain't winnin' the game yet can I get a rain check
Blow me a kiss in the wind, I'm missin' again
Don't let your sisters and your friends tell you this is the end
Talk a hole in your head puttin' bugs in your ear
Make you role in your bed when your thug ain't there
Somewhere around ladies know I get lonely and proud
Open my file baby you should know me by now
Tryin' to get paid and stay away from old sites
Find my place in life plus I like to hold mics

But yo it's gonna be alright just hold tight"

The sexy aura, it made it hard to ignore her
Expression her posession of property skyrocket
I'm investin' in her presence and in time, it profits
I take a acre for you, fertilize the soil
And make it boil 'til it produce black oil
The shorty sweet as the flavor of forty divas
Photos and features worth more than Mona Lisa's
It's Lady Luscious, tender touches, my blood rushes
Smiles and blushes on billboards and buses
And me? I'm just a bronze-skinned, calm gentleman
Slim-fit and open arms, mellow wit' a Don's grin
Ghetto disciplined, could be your confidant beyond friend

Programmed with protons, equipped with predicates
Electrons and elements just fit
Your pronoun hits the ground and that's that
Hit the floor like a meteor so get back
Commas and quotation marks separate the sparks
Followed the course in to avoid getting sharked
More volts than a lightning bolt, handle with care
I'm far from fragile, warfare won't tear
Armed and dangerous, trained for combat
Let off rounds and they won't respond back
Explosions I made to invade your parade
Your weak beats decay til they can't get played
Wrong elements in the mic, they get sprayed
Pass the hand grenade"

And he had made like ten dollars off the sign he wrote
It read: ""A lil hungry, and need a lil money
It's for my lil sister and her lil tummy""
Wasn't lyin', though—he didn't go buy hydro
Went to the restaurant and bought two gyros
Cause he knew they wasn't cookin' where he live
The ""kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk""s now took him to the crib
A lil' hurt from the rail he took into the ribs
Right past the pushers who couldn't under-dig
""What's the use of pushin', you ain't pushin' none of this?""
""If I kick it with y'all, I'm just pushin' for a bid""
But what was on his mind and pushed him to the lid
They best customer wasn't cookin' for her kids"

The technique from the two TECs and I don't need two lips
To blow this like a trumpet, you dumb shit
This is a unusual musical, I conduct it
You lookin' at the Black Warren Buffett
So all critics can duck sick
I don't care if you C. Delores Tuck-it
Or you Bill O'Reilly, you only rilin' me up
For three years, they had me peein' out of a cup
Now they 'bout to free me up, what you think I'm gon' be, what?
Rehabilitated? Man, I still feel hatred
I'm young, Black and rich so they wanna strip me naked, but
You'll never have me like Christina Aguiler-y
But catch me down the Westside, drivin' like Halle Berry
Or the FDR, in the seat of my car
Screamin' out the sunroof, ""Death to y'all""
You can't kill me, I live forever through these bars
I put the wolves on ya, I put a price on your head
The whole hood'll want ya, you startin' to look like bread
I send them boys at ya, I ain't talkin' 'bout feds
Nigga, them body-snatchers, nigga, you heard what I said"
Kurupt	4	Calling Out Names	Tha Streetz Iz a Mutha	1999	[Verse 3]	"Now if I didn't say yo name, then this ain't for you
But if you try to speak then I'mma peel the paint for you
I cause brain tumors thinkin' of a thought to think
Lettin' off caliber's 'til the chamber need to be changed
Empty out, simply don't tempt me
I empty out until everything in this mothafucka's gone
I empty house off of empty rounds
Now what the fuck you gotta say?
What the fuck you wanna see? The homies or my K
I never worry 'bout none of y'all so why now?
I run it through and this is how you do it Dogg Pound (ROOF!)

The half is — unsolved mystery re-enactments get practiced
What you lack is — you think like the average
Jakes dumbfound and leavin' crime scenes un-handled
Nothin' but cannons, gat conspicuous
Like a laminate or branded, with the serial scratched
Bad apple outta the batch, dunn, they made me like that
If I could push back the clock, probably leave it like that
Draw blood for my niggas G.O.D, Ty Nitty and Twin
And Twin is not here, plus my kin
Killa B forever with me, quick to set it with me
Enter QB to show love throughout the years with me
You got guns? We got guns — serious ones!

We come from where niggas look out for they dun-dunns

A nigga with a grip of that gangsta shit
With the Eastside hoes on my motherfuckin' dick

Swing it back, bring it back, just like this
And if you with my shit, then blaze up another spliff
And keep the motherfuckin' blunt in your pocket, loc

See, it's a West coast thing, where I'm from
And if you want some, get some, bad enough, take some

Because it represents me and the motherfuckin' East Side

Unload ten in broad daylight, get right, fuck your life!
Hop on my '98 dirt bike
You try to stop mines from growin'?
I'll make your blood stop flowin'
Take affirmative action, to any ass if he askin'

Kendrick Lamar	16	reincarnated	GNX	2024	[Verse 3]	"My present life is Kendrick Lamar
A rapper looking at the lyrics to keep you in awe
The only factor I respected was raisin' the bar
My instincts sent material straight to the charts, huh
My father kicked me out the house, I finally forgive him
I'm old enough to understand the way I was livin'
Ego and pride had me looking at him with resentment
I close my eyes, hoping that I don't come off contentious
I'm yelling, ""Father, did I finally get it right?"" Everything I did was selfless
I spoke freely, when the people needed me, I helped them
I didn't gloat, even told 'em, ""No,"" when the vultures came
Took control of my fleshly body when the money changed
Son, you do well, but your heart is closed
I can tell residue that linger from your past creates a cell
Father, I'm not perfect, I got urges, but I hold them down
""But your pride has to die,"" okay, Father, show me how
Tell me every deed that you done and what you do it for
I kept one hundred institutions paid
Okay, tell me more
I put one hundred hoods on one stage
Okay, tell me more
I'm tryna push peace in L.A. 
But you love war
No, I don't
Oh, yes, you do
Okay, then tell me the truth
Every individual is only a version of you
How can they forgive when there's no forgiveness in your heart?
I could tell you where I'm going
I could tell you who you are
You fell out of Heaven 'cause you was anxious
Didn't like authority, only searched to be heinous
Isaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent
My greatest music director was you
It was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues
It was harmony and motion
I sent you down to earth 'cause you was broken
Rehabilitation, not psychosis
But now we here now
Centuries you manipulated man with music
Embodied you as superstars to see how you moving
You came a long way from garnishing evilish views
And all I ever wanted from you was love and approval
I learned a lot, no more putting these people in fear
The more that word is diminished, the more it's not real
The more light that I can capture, the more I can feel
I'm using words for inspiration as an idea
So can you promise that you won't take your gifts for granted?
I promise that I'll use my gifts to bring understanding
For every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?
I vow my life just to live one in harmony now
You crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity
And I'm ashamed that I ever created that enemy
Then let's rejoice where we at
I rewrote the devil's story just to take our power back, 'carnated"

Attract the wrong eyes to the Buick out back
Now I'mma dump until I feel I made ya lungs collapse

Off Hennessy, I blast that ass to Tennessee and back
Who's that? I'm hopin' I'm about to bust this fool's back open
I'm laid back scopin'
Wit' the rope and the three main ingredients to the plot:
Some weed, my nigga D-A-Z and some heat cocked

I pray for the best outcome son, but my dome's already shattered
By the shit that's occurred
Driving home tipsy from the club, puffin herb, vision blurred
Thinking 'bout them niggas who caught the drop
Who I got to stop, who he caught, and who still gotta get popped
Stash box, feelin like Fish in ""King of New York""
Wifey do her thing for the god, she don't be bringing me pork
'Cause there's enough deadly shit a brother be facing
Up in V.I.P., niggas drinks they be lacing
Got a nigga sweatin pacing, not ready to fall the fuck up
But ready to pull out, and back 'em all the fuck out
And my guardian angel, is always there to protect
And my supreme nature, keeps all them savages in check
How the hell did everything get so twisted
They say be careful what you pray for, so I guess now it's this shit"

Laid the bitch out, then I put it in her mouth
Pulled out, nutted on a towel and passed out"

Telepathy increases melody gets speakers, telekinesis
Ideas appear as clear as, pictures in movie theaters
Lyrics you hear it, devastatin' the way you ear it
So stay tuned for sequels, part two's and more
So soon you and your peoples can bumrush the store
The names have changed, the game remain the same
How one came to reign on his claim to fame
No stoppin' this, I'm droppin' this with hip-hop in this
And when the topic is topicless, then I'm writin' the apocalypse"

She been with hoodlums, and those who had crazy chips
'Til one day she decided to flip
It was nuttin' I can do about it, like she the boss and shit
Started talkin' this divorcin' shit
I gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake half my car
Half my kids? Can't get that
Tried to swing on the God, had to dip that
Yo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that
All she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass
Had to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look
With a fine-ass body and a damn good cook
For some reason, yo, she had me stuck, and I had her in my web too
You my queen, God bless you"

I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Sponsors, industry promises
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?"

Silly of you to think that I would, but I will lay you

These days, you can't make it if you ain't affiliated with crime
A lifetime of street livin'
Throughout the beef I've accumulated
Many slugs have been given
But wildin' ain't the way to be livin'
You're only gonna end up bloody on the floor shiverin'
Or locked up, caught inside the beast
Meanwhile, on the streets, ain't no more peace
My man, Stobo, kid, hold your own
In a cell locked down, not far from home
And at the same time on the outside, I'm representin'
Still packin' heat, make you cowards keep steppin'
Gettin' high, it's 'cause of the lye, I can't lie
I could move the crowd poppin' slugs in the sky
Why come around if you afraid of what's over here?
My man Havoc put the bug in my ear
(It's) only facts coming out of my mouth piece
As far as I can see, these streets is gettin' sour
Q-U, too much drama to get into
And niggas regret when they begin to
Regardless of your name or what you been through
Pause for a second, open your eyes and think, duke
Life ain't the game that it seems to be
Fuck a fantasy, I'm livin' in reality
Caught up in this untouchable mentality
Hit you up bad, make you lose a few calories
I need to slow down, movin' through life at a high speed
Watchin' all the slow runners pass by me
I can see through you, due to, my Queens education
Speakin' on behalf of this drug-game nation

I'm still one of the deepest on the mic since Adidas
They said I changed the times from the rhymes that I thought of
So I made some more to put the New World in Order
With Mathematics, put your status above the average
And help you rappers, make paragraphs with graphics
Cause new days is dawning, new ways of performing
Brainstorming, I write and watch the night turn to morning
On and on and, I got the whole world responding

I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See, I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
Called ""I Miss The Old Kanye""? Man, that'd be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye

And Belly was like the sequel without O-Dog in it
Give me a New York minute
To show you Cali' got more dead bodies than the Yankees got New York pennants
'Cause we Dodgers in Impalas with the windows tinted
I duck shots where Venus and Serena used to play tennis
And they never came back like throwing a boomerang flat
See, me, I'm posted like a Cincinnati pitcher in the same hat
It's like a scene from a movie when the screen fade black
Niggas roll up on you, now you stuck in that Harold and Caine trap
If you slipping in Hollywood and you get your chain snatched

Call the motherfuckin' helicopter
But ain't no hope, 'cause the nina broke that nigga off a hella proper
That oughta hold your monkey ass (Motherfucker, you)
That oughta teach your funky ass (Motherfucker, you)
I know this motherfuckin' game is sheist
And you done lost the fuckin' game of life
And that's a motherfuckin' shame
You let a nigga come around and do your ass just like Jesse James"
Nas	9	Some of Us Have Angels	Nastradamus	1999	[Chorus]	"Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)"
Snoop Dogg	0	Sixx Minutes	Tha Doggfather	1996	[Verse 1]	"Well if it's on, then I guess it's 'bout time
Let me slide into this OG rhyme
I do mine the way I do mine
And I takes my time when I'm droppin' my lines
I look around, I spot MC's (and they)
All in the place (and they) all wannabe's
Tryin' to make their paper, tryin' to do they thang
But to me they all tryin' to say the same thang
How could you rap over beats that whack?
You ain't reachin' the crowd, you ain't makin' your fact
You ain't droppin' lines that hit the top
You can't make the party go hip-hop
And you can't do your thing without using mine
We get and steal, I see you're on the grind
But I'ma take my time to get my point across
And if you get caught up in the rap shit then got lost
And if you get tossed it's on your own, it's your own fault
See I gots ta get mine, I don't try no song
I just move on, groove on, try to prove on
Then I do mines to do mines and I'mma keep on, keep on, keep on
To get'cha you in a... .smooth type of atmosphere
Sit back and pay attention yeah
You ain't never heard it like that
Uhh, is that right? That's right black
But uhh"
Future	30	Thought It Was a Drought	DS2	2015	[Verse 1]	"Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you
I had to make me a cot
Now I called a contractor to make me a spot
I sold the dope out your house
Now you come to my house, I've got dope in the couch
You know I don't fuck with no rumors
Rocking red bottoms like they Pumas
Got these meds on me, I'ma do 'em
I take these pills and I'm having a thrill
Taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
As for the xanny, I never forgot it
Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
Gotta put up the cash, can't even stay in the house
Cause there’s too much to hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent, I was too far behind
Fuck I'm too out of time, fuck 'em two at a time
Had to do what I had to do to get where I'm at, niggas know I ain't lying
Niggas know I ain't lying
It's a lot on my mind, it's a lot on my plate
But I never complain
I was working the weight like I came out the gym
I never did train
Put the girl on a train
Strapped a bird on her back, now she came back with change, ayy"

Havoc	7	Adrenaline	Murda Muzik	1999	[Verse 2]	"Feel the gat blow while your shit rips
My shit'll hit while you lettin' niggas
Hopin' you could lower the wrist
That'll only put odds against any attempt
Any provoke, uprise you ain't got it in you
First of all you too soft for fastball
Point game track y'all merk like a Jaguar NASCAR
The weed out, buck 80 on yo sonar
Hennessy spillin' all over my radar
Stay charged, niggas gettin' amped off the mobb shit
Have you wildin' out on some club shit
Shit to make them dance at the same time
Stop and glance
Slap flames out the nigga with the wrong idea
Young niggas young minds but that's quite contrar'
Young niggas smart niggas
Who started from the stairs
How dare
You try to come around the way
In fear like a nigga that been there for years
Shout words that we live but don't play with it
'Cause when the shit go down you be like they did it"
Eminem	15	Underground	Relapse	2009	[Chorus]	"Here comes the rain and thunder now

I disappeared, don't wonder how
Lookin' for me? I'm underground"
Nas	9	Big Girl	Nastradamus	1999	[Chorus]	"(You're a big girl now)
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out
(No more daddy's little girl)
You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around
(You're a big girl now)
She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it, uhh
(No more daddy's little girl)
I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her
My ghetto queen of Sheba"
50 Cent	19	My Buddy	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Chorus]	"My buddy, my buddy
Wherever I go, he go

Stay in your place I recommend
Or say hello to my little friend"

Rakim	10	Strong Island	The Master	1999	[Verse 2]	"Like any G.O.D., loose on a spree for new degrees
Things to do and see until nuttin is new to me
A true MC usually be into a breeze
And I can still see New York City through the trees
My advance slams put you outside lookin in
Or the other way around, that depends, look again
Took a pen so you could zero in on my book of gems
It extends from the Hamptons to Brook-lyn
Through every hoodie in town, to learn the Boogie Down
Til every DJ around, wanted to put me down
Rhymes got rougher til I was ready to blast off
And harass all from Suffolk County to Nassau
Where we keep the money pilin, keep the honies smilin
Keep the heater just in case kids start whylin
The rhyme that I'm stylin, smooth as a violin
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island"
Common	22	All Night Long	One Day It’ll All Make Sense	1998	[Verse 1]	"During divine hours, I use mind power to refine
Flower girls, and make 'em feel like black pearls
Get they minds off acryllic nails and the rap world
It's a lot you can find in the lost black girl
Ma-sons build in lodges, we be in garages
Discussin' who we boned and who God is
Pro-black like Craig Hodges with my dashikis in the cleaners
I kick it for the Chevy ridin' head to backstreet leaners"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Poetic Justice	good kid, m.A.A.d city	2012	[Chorus]	"()

Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright"
Big Boi	26	Roses	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse 3]	"Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty
I said, ""Shorty, would you call me?""
She said, ""Pardon me, are you balling?""
I said ""Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing""
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, droppin' names, she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place to sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't wanna get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, not support you
(Not support you, not support you)"
2Pac	18	Me Against the World	Me Against The World	1994	[Outro]	"Hahaha, that's right
I know it seem hard sometimes
But, uh, remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get
Stick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it"
Nas	9	One Love	Illmatic	1994	[Verse 3]	"Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin', ""How can we exist through the facts?""
Written in school textbooks, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend, hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I needed time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the nine at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with them corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to ten
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together, in the 'Bridge, we call 'em ""oo-wops""
He said, ""Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre deuce""
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was 'sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
'Cause when the pistol blows, the one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Could have caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only 12, tryna tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: Try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, shorty wop, one love"
Snoop Dogg	0	California Roll	BUSH	2015	[Verse 1]	"Say when I pass you that weed and I ask if you can roll
You say ""Bro, don't you know I'm from 'round here?""
Well, girl, I like the way you roll, even though you from the ghetto
You belong in a home in the mountains
Not talking 'bout the view
I'm talking 'bout me and you
So if you wanna go to Melrose
Let's hit Adidas, girl, we got our own shell toes
And then we'll go to Venice
You roll so good, you might as well let me hit it
For, like, fifteen minutes
Girl, you never gon' forget it
And if you wanna go around town
I could show you where all the real get it
And if you wanna go downtown
You might as well roll with a real nigga
I'm not talking 'bout them fools
I'm talking 'bout me and you"
50 Cent	19	Footprints	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Chorus]	"First there was two sets of footprints in the sand
Then there was one set of footprints in the sand
When times get hard and shit hits the fan
God don't walk with me, he carry me man
First there was two sets of footprints in the sand
Then there was one set of footprints in the sand
When times get hard and shit hits the fan
God don't walk with me, he carry me man"
Kendrick Lamar	16	i (Album Version)	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 3]	"I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it 'til I get it right (Oh, no)
I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night, woo)
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body—"
Big Boi	26	Humble Mumble	Stankonia	2000	[Verse 1]	"Back on the microphone, your number one controller
I rock the microphone like a blizzard; I'm so cold I'm tryin' to told ya
Life is like a great big roller coaster
Everything in life don't always happen like it's supposed to
Trials and tribulations make you stronger, live longer
You wanna reach the nation, nigga, start from ya corner
Everything don't always happen like you plan it
Demand it; over-stand it, then you handle it
Fuck wishing, you missing the ambition on your mission
Now you switchin'
Why you quittin? 'Cause it's heated in the kitchen?
Sloppy slipping in your pimpin', nigga (Nigga)
You either pistol whoop the nigga or you choke the trigger
You've gots to follow through, struggle to complete your dreams
""No Weapon Formed Against You Prospers"" 54:17
From Isaiah, lay a, nigga down and spray 'em
If the dealer dealt a fucked up hand of cards, you've gotta play 'em"
Kanye West	5	Lost In the World	My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy	2010	[Verse]	"You're my devil, you're my angel
You're my heaven, you're my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, you're my jail
You're my lies, you're my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
You're my questions, you're my proof
You're my stress and you're my masseuse
Ma-ma-se, ma-ma-se, ma-ma-ku-sa
Lost in this plastic life
Let's break out of this fake-ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each other's arms
Still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each other's arms
Still get laid, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Dr. Dre	1	All in a Day’s Work	Compton	2015	[Verse 4]	"Rich as fuck, but guess what? I'm back to work
Overseas, back home, no time to sleep, I'm back to work
So many people that I love, they want my time but I got to work
Some of my friends don't understand, shit, I got to work
Always talkin' 'bout bustin' the club but I'm like, ""Fuck that, I gotta work""
If you really wanna do it like this, shit, you better get back to work
Back to work, right back to work
Gotta get back to work, shit, right back to work"
Nas	9	Big Things	I Am...	1999	[Verse 2]	"When I started this
All I wanted was cars and cribs
Like other rap artists but
Do I know where I'm goin' to?
Can I forget when I came from?
I be showin' you
Another style I'ma flow for you
Can I make somethin' wild
I can throw for you, flow for you
Make it bi-coastal
Take it to heights
That some of y'all can't come close to?
Some of y'all
Want to talk like hoes
Worse than bitches
And when y'all niggas see me blow
Bet it hurt like stitches
No competition
I stop and twist 'em
Hit 'em like a mafia proposition
I rap and y'all stop and listen
Thinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in
Look up at a nigga, now
Rocks that glisten
Can't stop my mission
Make another LP drop
I'm hittin' with the new shit, exclusive
No time to get caught up in a crime
I ain't have shit to do with
Used to chase the hoes
Now I chase the dough
Is y'all bitches gonna help me get paper?
No!"
Nas	9	Small World	I Am...	1999	[Chorus]	"It's a small world (It's a...)
Nigga you reap what you sow (...Small world)
What goes around comes around, if you sleep you don't know
A very small world (It's a...)
Where beef could never end (...Small world)
At the time you least expect it, I'ma see you again
It's a small world (It's a...)
You get away with it now (...Small world)
Soon enough it catches up to you, someway, somehow
Yo, it's a small world, watch what you do... (It's a... small world)"
Kanye West	5	Lost In the World	My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy	2010	[Chorus]	"I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life

Oh-oh, get down"
Lloyd Banks	34	You Already Know	Get Rich Or Die Tryin’ Music From And Inspired By The Motion Picture	2005	[Chorus]	"You already know, my mind is on my dough
A millionaire that won't spend a dollar on a ho
I'm still in here tryna get a model out the do'
High blowin bottle after bottle of that dro
Slidin on the road, groupie in my vehicle that I don't even know
And If I wasn't Banks shorty probably wouldn't roll
From the Benz to the lobby from the lobby to the do'
If you ain't with the program ma you gotta go"

Tonight you wanna fuck with me
It's aight with me, come on and gimme that groupie love"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	I Ain’t No Joke	Paid in Full	1987	[Verse 3]	"I hold the microphone like a grudge
B'll hold the record so the needle don't budge
I hold a conversation 'cause what I invent
I nominated my DJ for president
When I emcee, I'll keep a freestyle going steadily
So pucker up and whistle my melody
But whatever you do, don't miss one
There'll be another rough rhyme after this one
Before you know it, you're following and fiending
Waiting for the punchline to get the meaning
Like before the moral of my story I'm telling
Nobody beats the R, so stop yelling
Save it, put it in your pocket for later
'Cause I'm moving the crowd, and B'll wreck the fader
No interruptions, and the mic is broke
When I'm gone, then you can joke
'Cause everything is real, on a serious tip
Keep playing and I get furious quick
And I'll take you for a walk through hell
Freeze your dome, then watch your eyeballs swell
Guide you out of triple-stage darkness
When it get dark again, then I'ma spark this microphone
'Cause the heat is on, you see smoke
And I'm finished when the beat is gone, I'm no joke"
Dr. Dre	1	Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat	The Chronic	1992	[Verse 2]	"Creepin' and peepin' and we can get with these
The Chronic, slangin' fat ki's from my block
And it don't stop, tell me where you wanna go
To the strip, or take a trip ballin' with the Row
My shit off in your system attacks
Indo smoke go in your lungs like that
You get lifted, calm, and if it's the bomb
Taken away like Calgon, Vietnam
California, back and on a mission
Provin' a point, in my game, ain't no fuckin' competition
They wishin' but run up on reality
C-P-T, C-A-L my locality
It's strange how I re-arrange and change
The business by droppin' shit like this
Dope, niggas can't cope with the real
I bill, penitentiary steel, when I kill, it goes"

Prodigy	8	Survival of the Fittest	The Infamous	1995	[Verse 1]	"There's a war goin' on outside no man is safe from
You could run, but you can't hide forever
From these streets that we done took
You walkin' with your head down, scared to look
You shook, ‘cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cops' control
They better have the riot gear ready
Tryin' to bag me and get rocked steady!
By the MAC one-double, I touch you
And leave you with not much to go home with
My skin is thick, ‘cause I be up in the mix of action
If I'm not at home, puffin' lye, relaxin'
New York got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul
Before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
Into the drama I built
And all unfinished beef, you will soon be killed
Put us together, it's like mixin' vodka and milk
I'm goin out blastin', takin' my enemies with me
And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord, forgive me, the Hennessy got me not knowin' how to act
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
Or maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black
That I can't say, so it's left a untold fact
Until my death, my goal's to stay alive
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive"
Snoop Dogg	0	Snoop Bounce	Tha Doggfather	1996	[Verse 2]	"I keep niggas in the studio, word is bond
Been workin on ya new album for two years strong
And still can't come up with the right song
You know what they say:'Study long, study long'
All aboard the train so come along
Cos we keep the glue stuff against the bone
It's alright ain't no room for wrong
Doggyland is the motherland, make yourself at home
I got money loads by the barrels
I even got a few fans that's crazy like DeNiro
I'm international money maker, player hater
Shhok up off the sake of spendin dollars and I always holler
At a player though cos players know the real from the fake
You can put that on your toast, your coast and your state
I give you people what you like
What I look like in jail and can't get on the mic"

Common	22	Time Travelin’ (A Tribute to Fela)	Like Water for Chocolate	2000	[Verse 2]	"Time travelin, took my time in hand
My rhyme learn and plan
Jealousy, money and pride can burn a man
Some walk but never learn to stand
Still, afraid to expand what they feel
I'm dealin wit, wakes, marriages
ATM's, Ericsson's
Loud niggas that whisper carelessness
If we livin in Revelation
Why should the people of the sun have to run?
Come to Esau in a year, he'll have freedom
He ask why I hadn't been to see him
Really, I ain't have a good reason
He said, ""Rah, give back what you receivin""
In a race against time, I was caught
In the same game as you, but long live the sport
It's time travelin
It's the C-double-O and I'm back again
Take this back and then, tell a friend
Spaces and places you been
Time travelin *fades out* time travelin...."

Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say, ""Only God can judge me,"" 'cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my Black ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in GoodFellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie? (Homie)"

Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from bein' alcoholic
Nine-hundred-ninety-nine thou' from bein' rich
But now, I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel, Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smokin' on Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass, yo, the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while I'm hoppin' in the drop-top BM'
Word is bond (Uh), son (What), I had that bitch down on my shit  (What, uh) like this (Word)"

I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina

Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)"

Eric B. & Rakim	14	The R	Follow the Leader	1988	[Verse 3]	"In the summertime, pockets bulgin'
Something's happenin', then I'm indulgin'
Music is mine, Gucci seats reclined
Gold grill, a paint job will shine
Pull up in the park and then pop the trunk
Turn up the bass and let the system thump
A block party starts to form, people start to swarm
Loud as a ghetto blaster, word is bond
Records remind you of a madness
The moment it's played, you get glad it's
The return of the brother, keepin' you up to par
And you're doing it with The R"
JAY-Z	6	Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)	Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life	1998	[Verse 3]	"I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Got a lotta beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, etched your name out
Put Jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga!"
JAY-Z	6	22 Two’s	Reasonable Doubt	1996	[Verse 1]	"Too much West Coast dick lickin'
And too many niggas on a mission, doin' your best Jay-Z rendition
Too many rough motherfuckers, I got my suspicions
That you're just fish in a pool of sharks, nigga, listen
Too many bitches wanna be ladies, so if you a ho
I'ma call you a ho, too many bitches are shady
Too many ladies give these niggas too many chances
Too many brothers wannabe lovers don't know what romance is
Too many bitches stuck up from too many sexual advances
No question; Jay-Z got too many answers
I been around this block too many times
Rocked too many rhymes, cocked too many nines, too
To all my brothers it ain't too late to come together
'Cause too much black and too much love, equal forever
I don't follow any guidelines 'cause too many niggas ride mine
So I change styles every two rhymes"

Wanted one though, they were so dope (Yeah)
Was a have-not (Yeah) 'cause my pockets (Uh)
Didn't have knots, I was so broke
On my last rock, for my slingshot
Better haul ass, don't be no slow poke (Nope)
Through the tall grass, run your ass off (Yeah)
Oh no, got your pants caught on the fence post
Getting chased, by them Jackboys, think it's 'bout to fuzz
Like a lint roller they wait 'til it's late, they will tiptoe
Through your living room window
Take your Nintendo and then skate
Making you feel like you got bent over and raped
Little boy, you're never gonna get no rope chain
Get your shit stole, and your lip swole, I became bitter
As I got a little bit older, my hate
Was making me get cold, and began to get a chipped shoulder
Started to spit vulgar, my ZIP code had been skid row
But I ate every single beat that I spit over, the shithole I escaped
Then I began to explode, detonate, now the Eastside went schizo
Thought my name was B-side 'cause they flipped over my tape
And I won't hesitate
To get 'em all bent so outta shape (Fuck)
Shit, bro, hold up, wait
I just tripped over my cape (Superman)
And I'm not gonna let up, treat the paper like I'm chopping a letter
Dre'll tell you how I shred
So when you refer to the guy next to the doc, you meant shredder
Now the cops wanna set up roadblocks on my head, I
Got several bounties from feds in every county
I'm with a gal at a Checkers wiling
Bumping ""Fuck Da Police"" while I fed her Rally's
This shit is like Romper Room
Why do I feel responsible for these kids?
All of whom I'm a father to
I'm a God to you, y'all better worship the water I walk on
Or y'all gonna meet your Waterloo
I get to flippin' the mic' as a murder weapon
I'm poppin' an extra clip, then cock and shoot, then I'm popping
Do not let me catch you slippin'
I will pop up and I'll take a spot from you
I'll get to doing what a leaky faucet do
But I ain't talkin' drip when I say that I'll get the drop on you
Singin' fuck all of you in Autotune
I am too volatile and too grizzly to bear
Yeah, shit is gettin' to where I can barely even sit in a chair
I bust my ass for this shit and I swear
It ain't even worth dissing someone so offbeat
That they can't even figure out where their words
Should hit the kick and the snare"
Eminem	15	Marsh	Music to Be Murdered By	2020	[Chorus]	"I'm Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)

She be grabbin', callin' me Biggie like Shyne home
Man, I swear, she fine homes, why she always lyin', though?
Tellin' me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played Ready for the World, she was ready for some action
My dog said you ain't no freak so you 'bout to prove my man wrong
I'ma play this Vandross, you gon' take yo' pants off
I'ma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon' get right"
Future	30	Blood on the Money	DS2	2015	[Chorus 1]	"It got blood on the money and I still count it

From the front to the back this cognac got my throat burnin like burlap
Everybody cheesin, knowin these hoes gon' cut like Pleasers
These hookers they praisin my crew
Like Reverend Hodo be praisin Jesus
The easiest was the meanest, but the skeezer was a beanie
She thought we was some motherfuckin genies

Told her, and her silly friends

From the old to the new and the rest of them

Much too young to bite the bullet
Hand on the trigga

I hope I live to be a man
Must be part of some big plan to keep a brotha in the state pen
Counting pennies over the years I'd done stacked many
Proving wrong those
Who swore I'd wouldn't live till twenty
Now they gotta cope
Since it's the only thing I know
It's difficult to let it go
I'm startin' to lose my hair 'cause I worry
Hustlin' to keep from gettin' buried

'Cause these suckers love ta' spray where I lay down
My homie lost his family, he snapped
Shot up half the block to bring 'em back
The streets are Deathrow"

Nas	9	Can’t Forget About You	Hip Hop Is Dead	2007	[Verse 3]	"Unforgettable, unsubmittable, I go by N now
Just one syllable, it's the end cause the game's tired
It's the same vibe, Good Times had right after James died
That's why the gangsta rhymers ain't inspired
Heinous crimes help record sales more than creative lines
And I don't wanna keep bringing up the greater times
But I'm a dreamer nostalgic with the state of mind
The past the past enough of it, aight then
But nothing gives me chills like Douglas and Tyson
Or Mike when his talk was live
Or when he first did the moon walk on Motown 25"

If it's gon' get me the pussy, I'ma play that shit
If she bite too hard I'ma say that shit
But don't bite me bitch, I don't play that shit
Marcus Houston, I don't play that shit
By the time we got half way through watchin' Ray, I hit
I laid her down, beat it up, let her go clean it up
Take a five minute nap, wake up and eat it, what?
Then it's part two in the sauna
Feel like I'm fuckin' Mary J. 'cause she don't want no drama
I'd rather take your ass to the Bahamas
Than give you thirty thousand a month like Diddy, baby momma"
Big Boi	26	GhettoMusick	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse]	"Hot tub, bad to the bony, I'm Tony
Ask my Grandmama Edna Mae Kearse—she showed me
How to be the smooth operator, dominator
In the state of Georgia, hip-hop standard destroyer
Leave a motherfucker open like a foyer
""He from the Dirty""— now here come the paranoia
A lawyer couldn't object or disrespect the technique
Sweat me, wipe off the sweat
Fight off the shit, and flush the waste down
The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground
Find my purpose on the surface of this Earth
This planet's standards trust and the purpose
Campaign in vain for the same lame fame you've obtained
You ought to be detained
By the Hip-Hop Sheriff, locked up, no possibility
Of getting out because the shit you make is killing me
And my ears, and my peers
I hear the end is near, no fear, we disappear
Then reappear again in a fresh, new light
I hope it's peaceful and cloudy, 'cause if it's not, we gotta fight, like"

From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths"

How am I even mentioned by all these fuckin' beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil', so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fuckin' insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fuckin' not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges, fuckin' ridiculous"

That would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
‘Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffin' at authority, defiant often
Flyin' off at the handle at my mom
No dad, so I am noncompliant at home
At school I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlyin' problems
Thinkin' he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalkin' up drawings
On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'
To myself, either that or inside hidin' off in
The corner somewhere quiet, tryin' not to
Be noticed ‘cause I'm cryin' and sobbin'
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin'
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker
‘Cause he said that I eye-balled him"

One day we all die, baby
So I'd rather go hard, keep Cali alive, baby
Yeah, keep Cali alive, baby
Double entendre, nigga, that's my baby
And don't nobody father kids like me

I made fucked up decisions but don't let 'em crucify me
I'm still the same nigga on my California ID
Yeah, Compton nigga
Blame Dre, it's his fault that I'm a monster, nigga
I was selling crack in west side Bompton, nigga
Yeah I can rap, but I ain't ask for no sponsors, nigga

A million beats a minute, I know I push you to your limit
But it's this game Love, I'm caught up all in it
They make it so you can't prevent it
Never give it, you gotta take it, can't fake it, I keep it authentic
My hand got this pistol shakin'
'Cause I sense danger like Camp Crystal Lake and
Don't wanna shoot him, but I got him trapped within this infrared dot
About to hot him and hit rock bottom

Came from the bottom of the block, I—
When I was born, it was sworn:
I was never gon' be shit
Had to pull the opposite out this bitch
Had to get my ri-ide on (Rider)
""Eyes on the prize, Shawn""
Knew I had to, had to, had to get these chips
Had to make moves like Olajuwon
Started out selling dimes and nicks
Graduated to a brick, no exaggeration
My infatuation with the strip legendary
Like a schoolboy crushin' on
Merely nearly-every-every chick (Woo)
Heavy shit—that's how schoolboy got whipped
And got left on some ""just me, myself, and I""
On some Trugoy shit
Had to voyage to a place of
To a place of no return
Had to play with fire and get burned

He bring the heat with the beat for the Dogg Pound gang
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back
But back in the days he wasn't nothing like that
I remember when he used to scrap every day
When my auntie would tell him he would never obey
He wore his khakis hanging down with his Stars untied
And a blue and grey cap that said ""The Eastside""
Around my neighborhood the people treated him bad
They said Daz was the worst thing his mom ever had
They said, ""He would grow up to be nothing but a gangster""
Or either in jail, or someone would shank him
But now he's grown up to their surprise
D-A-Z got a hit record slanging worldwide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Bumping Dogg Food, Doggfather, and Doggystyle"

Got about fifty guns and I love
All of 'em the same, bang-bang (Word up)
Damn, baby girl, what's your name? (What's your name?)
I forgot, what'd you say it was? Damn, a nigga buzzed (Fucked up)

Pop a bottle, 'cause when you come home, we still got it sewn
We can watch the tape, play back and just zone
Film all the bitches, on the benches with ill extensions
We block the streets off, only crew cars can enter
Music was loud and it was crowded
Barbecued wings, we fed the fiends

Guzzled his drink, and staggered off

Couldn't take losin' his cash, and I could feel
Something in the air, yeah, Frank returned with Pierre
A gunslinger, who niggas hadn't seen in a year
I usually be holdin', 'specially this type of weekend
And everyone except for me had started reachin'
They had gats in each other's faces
With kids and grandmothers around, Frank's only concern was his papers
My man Killa let off, half of them fake niggas jet off
Police blitz quick, waitin' for that to set off
Runnin' the static, it got me mad 'cause they a bunch of faggots
Startin' shit in my hood, I can't have it
Yo, High, get the 40-Cali stainless
Jake is still out, let's make it real and still make them niggas famous
Dip behind trees in fatigues and squeeze, dodge and weave
Hearin' Jake retaliatin', and Wiz was up the alley waitin'
We breeze, jump in the ride, heard Pierre died
Internal bleedin' inside, and ain't been back since '95"
Kendrick Lamar	16	reincarnated	GNX	2024	[Verse 2]	"Another life had placed me as a Black woman in the Chitlin' Circuit
Seductive vocalist as the promoter hit the curtains
My voice was angelic, straight from heaven, the crowd sobbed
A musical genius what the articles emphasized
Had everything I wanted, but I couldn't escape addiction
Heroin needles had me in fetal position, restricted
Turned on my family, I went wherever cameras be
Cocaine, no private planes for my insanity
Self-indulged, discipline never been my sentiments
I needed drugs, to me, an 8-ball was like penicillin
Fuck love, my happiness was in that brown sugar
Sex and melodies gave me hope when nobody's lookin'
My first assistant was a small town scholar
Never did a Quaalude 'til I got myself around her
My daddy looked the other way, he saw sin in me
I died with syringes pinched in me, reincarnated"
Eminem	15	Asshole	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 3]	"Holy mackerel! I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth
I smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinkin' we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed, ""ICP in this bitch! How do fuckin' magnets work?""
‘Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm makin' up words so you can understandable, it's tragical
Thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical
You crackin' a joke, it's laughable
‘Cause me and love's like a bad combination
I keep them feelings locked in a vault
So it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor
Bitch, you just need a helmet
‘Cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind
Shorty, you're fine, but you sort of remind me of a 49er
‘Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
Been tryna hunt me down like a dog
‘Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent
‘Cause all of my spare time is spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters
But sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father
And I push it farther
So, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent
I'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents
And motherfuck father time
It ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist
Who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half-alive
Poured my half-empty glass in a cup
Now my cup has runneth over
And I'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster
I’m goin' back to what got me here
Yeah, cocky, and can’t knock bein' rude off, so fear not, my dear
And dry up your teardrops, I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself because you're one too
Shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows"
Kendrick Lamar	16	DNA.	DAMN.	2017	[Bridge]	"I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA

Guru	20	The Planet	Hard to Earn	1994	[Verse 2]	"Crash-boom bang, I used to hang at Four Corners
And all the spots in Beantown where niggas carry burners
But I was more turned on by the microphone
So one cold morning, I left home
Next I'm smokin' blunts on Van Siclen
Or workin' in a mail room uptown, feelin' sick and
Tired of payin' all these fucked up dues
I wasn't tryin' to lose, I refused
Had a chick uptown, one in Queens and one in Jersey
Sometimes all you need to get by is a girlie
But yo, I still wasn't happy
I seen a lot of ill shit on my block happen nightly
East New York is no joke, kid
And peace to my man Hass doin' his bid
I went to Flatbush to buy incense and weed
Stopped at the bookstands for somethin' to read
That shit was rough 'cause my pockets was bare
And like the sayin goes, sometimes life ain't fair
But in my heart, there ain't no quittin'
So I stayed up late to write some rhymes to some rhythms
Seconds away from just flippin'
But fuck it, I'll maintain, one day I'll be hittin'
See, I'ma make it, god damn it
Out in B-R-double-O-K-lyn, the planet
I'll never fake it, just slam it
There in B-R-O-O-K-lyn, the planet"

Slippin' slidin for a proper come up to come around
Called up the homies from way back, who dream of gettin paid
Then finally get paid with the amount of 80 G's
6:30 lay in cut, prepare to get ready
Me and Ty and Kurupt, mashin to get our fetti
Food stamps galore, kick in the door get on the floor
Make sure my homies get away smooth with the dough
A hardcore motherfucker raised up not knowin
Now my dream is just a dream we're sellin dope and hoein
Moms can't tell me shit, I make the rules that I live by
In and out the house, late at night, and plus I got high
The homies influenced me to be the G of all G's
Perfectedly innovated to all my homies
Pull out the Riviera, plus I kick up dust
Pull out the brain, pull out the thang, cock back and bust
It's just some gangsta shit, goin down on the Eastside
Some niggas who died and tried to hooride on mine
Pull on the 7 Carter with the homey Flossy Floss
He's the homey from the Beach who's known for takin off
Pile up the bird then swerve, conversate on smokin some herb
Finger on the trigger, cons-templatin on a murder
I mean, takin life for life, cause it's right
Shit, niggas gotta do, to earn they stripes, straight merkin"

Eminem	15	Careful What You Wish For	Relapse	2009	[Verse 2]	"I got a letter from a fan that said he's been prayin' for me
Every day and for some reason, it's been weighin'
On my mind heavy, 'cause I don't read every
Letter I get, but somethin' told me to go ahead and open it, but
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at, I've already told you
At least a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but I've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watchin' it from a opposite standpoint, man, boy's got to look
Nuts, and that's the only word I can think of
Right now, on how to describe the shit
It's just like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it
Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit"
Snoop Dogg	0	Pimp Slapp’d	Paid Tha Cost To Be Da Bo$$	2002	[Verse 1]	"A day in the life, of a Rollin' 20 Crip
I'm just a stubborn type of fella with a head like a brick
Now just because I sip Moet, they say that I'm hopeless
But I don't give a fuck, so blame it on the loc'ness
Now this is how we do it when we checking the grip
Snoop Dogg is in this bitch, so don't even trip
I bust a funky composition that's as smooth as a prism
So check it while I kick off in this funky-ass rhythm
It's six dub, the phone is ringing off the deck
And it's some homies talking about I disrespected they set
Aww nah, Dogg ain't diss y'all
I got a couple relatives up off of Crenshaw
This is about me and Simon, not me and y'all
I got love for a bunch of real B-Dogs
Like K-Dub, Top Cat, B-Real, E-Rock, Boo-Lay Face
And the homie Heron, rest in peace
Big Jay from Campanella Park
He used to blaze with his nephew after dark
On and on, rocking big Neckbone
Mausberg, I had to put you on my song
It's so real, I had to show some love
Now back to this scrub, it ain't about Crip or Blood
It's about you bein' jealous of what I does
'Cause I does it the most, the king of the coast
In the paint playin' post - I back you down
Like Shaq-Daddy, and bust on ya out the new Caddy
And skirt up Wilshire Boulevard
I'm not Xzibit, you can't pull my ho card
I fucked all your groupies
When you was doing time in Camp Snoopy
With the fags and snitches, no killers just bitches
And you was payin' niggas off with all my riches
You so hardco', why you ain't go to level fo'?
Oh, I know (Bitch!)
But I walk the mainline every time I go down
You can check my G Files, I do it L.B.C. style (Crip!)
I got the word on you Simon
You need to just start rhymin'
'Cause you the biggest star on your label
And them other niggas just crumbs off my table
You're not able, to compete with the heat that I drop
And I still ain't been paid, for ""1-8-7 on a cop""
I started yo' shit and I will end yo' shit
If you keep talkin shit on Crip!"

Feel like I've been waitin' on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm duckin' on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential—I peeked (Haha)
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck
It's just me, you, and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in a car right now—wait, here comes my favorite lyric
""I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die""
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now 'cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck, the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear?
Guess ninety on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God! Police! Agh!)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan, Stan!
Slim: ""Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car""

Last call for alcohol, make a fast call for the hay

They tried to take the soul out me
They tried to take my confidence and they know I'm cocky
Fuck another interview, I'm done with it
I don't give a fuck about lil' ho', I let young hit it
I play the games of the thrones with you
I can't change, I was God-given
Tried to make me a pop star and they made a monster

A nigga was depressed now my mind back home
A product of the roaches in them ashtrays
I inhale the love on a bad day
Baptized inside purple Actavis"

I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm going through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
'Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keeping a poker face
To straight breaking down and showing all emotions
From anxious to believing real G's don't cry

I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died with you"

Even if you lose some, he would give you new ones
Twice the bread, it's like he had two buns
And he had a whole lot of seeds
Even his kids had meals for reals
Some rich small fries wrapped in paper since they was lil
Catch up, nigga"

Fever, was it me or either summer madness
'Cause I just can't stand around
So I get closer, and the closer I get, the better it sound
My mind start to activate, rhymes collaborate
'Cause when I heard the beat, I just had to make
Something from the top of my head
So I fell into the groove of the wax and I said
How could I move the crowd?
First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instruction, put it together
It's simple, ain't it? But quite clever
Some of you've been trying to write rhymes for years
But weak ideas irritate my ears
Is this the best that you can make?
'Cause, if not, and you got more, I'll wait
But don't make me wait too long, 'cause I'ma move on
The dance floor when they put something smooth on
So turn up the bass, it's better when it's loud
'Cause I like to move the crowd"

Then they killed Biggie, he just came through to visit
Rampart division, Pirus ain't had nothing to do with it
So many niggas in caskets, then turned ashes
Some get shot, some Hussein Fatal in car crashes
I think it's a conspiracy theory, Illuminati
How Pac died and two months later they killed Kadafi
Then they killed Buntry Al and Heron, they getting sloppy
LAPD, these niggas worse than the Nazis
And Pac was only 25, thuggin' as a youngin'
Sitting shotgun, I wonder if he seen them shots coming
Guess it don't matter, all them niggas buried, though

My composure stays above sixty degrees
Before I enter in a circle and start maraudin' MC's
The hysteria starts, multiplied two times
Supplied by the vibes, here's a run wild style they can't match
In the back of my vocab batch
If you can enter, take the stash
Nigga, I'll start from scratch
So enter in my zone, I refuse to be dethroned
I got a microphone I had to kill and murder to own
From the bottom to the top, and when you stare in my eyes
Emotionless shit registers in my mind when I get high
The darkest secrets — keep it untold
When it's revealed, the Amityville mirage will unfold
Take flight, I ignite like C-dash-4
With Daz, I'll blow the shit the fuck up like the last World War
My creations — mental invasions
Thoughts that's able to annihilate generations, wit' so much style"

But word up, I try to leave the streets alone
But it's crazy hard kid, in other words, it's spooky
The streets be callin' me, like the crack be callin' Pookie
It ain't a dumb joke, listen to this young folk
'Cause where I'm from, you can choke from the gun smoke
Stay off the corners, that might be your best plan
Before you catch a bullet that was meant for the next man

Or relaxin' on a hospital bed from bein' street struck"

New ways to make money
New ways to break dummies
Forge they name and take money
Computers ain't that smart
Whatever man built could be taken apart
Anything new can get old
Like dudes started rockin' platinum, some stopped wearin' gold
Solar-energized rides, no steerin' wheel, tell it how to drive
No propellers in the sky
Airplanes like many rockets
Waitin lists for the rich to get tickets to visit Mars
While the poor people starve, computers takin' over they jobs
A man's forced to live off land
Now it's back to the caveman era
When we made fire, by two sticks rubbin' together
The truth is, many are too scared of new data
America Online, cut off, see you later"

Bite this I might flip, spread a billion plagues
Put medicine in it before I kill ya dead
You can get away, if you can feel your legs
Could you walk? No, at least you fought though
Auto fours blow a hole in your torso
Damage his brain with more flow until he talk slow
Try to say something now? I thought so!
I leave emcee's bleeding, while I'm fleeing across sea-in
Start breeding, double my Swiss cheese in Sweden
Free on the weekend, come back see if he breathing
They breathing, somebody left his brains beat in
A deadly attack is rare, style will be raw
Be ready to rap you'll hear, as wild as before
If I bust a gat in the air, watch the galaxy fall
And the world will be splat on the floor, that'll be all"

Girls on my hip like a Skytel pager
Now I'm on the top, let the champagne pop
Throw ya hands in the sky cause The Game don't stop
Just a little more change, gotta Benz and the Range
Every rap metaphor always ends in my name
The Kool Hercs, DJ Red Alerts

Keep the money for myself and take the work back home
Call that nigga on the phone (Ayy), ""I just got knocked
And the cops was askin' 'bout you, come get me hot""
Never showed, so fuck him and the money that I owed
I got a get rich quick scheme, steppin' on the dope
It's cold, but that's it, I'm on it like I want it
And twenty-eight cash and change, the whole game on it
That means I'm on my feet and I can front the homies D
Break 'em off a couple of C, and double up they fee
Takin' over, shoot up they spot, make it hot
And when the cops dry it out, put my work on the block
And if they wanna ride for they corners we ride right with 'em
Dummy move, whole thing, the goon squad get 'em"

If you get the chance
To be a man in a b-boy stance and advanced from the go
I'll trace outer space with a unh
The baby-sitter of styles - I've traveled miles with
Bitches and....I've traveled miles with.....
I've traveled miles with bitches and brew the ritual
Of the real unh
Your platinum but real unh's don't feel you
You sampled real unh's and then filtered
I'm built to last - at last I'm free

Back in the hood, it's a different type of chemical
Arm & Hammer baking soda, raised they whole quota
Right when our soldiers, ran for the stove 'cause...
Dreams of being Hova
Went from bein' a broke man to bein' a dopeman
To bein' the president—look, there's hope, man!

I can hear the people calling I'm passing by
Everybody knows I'm balling and to God
Gotta keep myself from falling, but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do?
Getting shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while? You decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper some dirty words
In your ears as I kiss ya on every curve
Slow down baby, don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates to your waterfall up in Heaven
And don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was.."

But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Now, now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Haha)
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?

Gang Starr	21	Comin’ for Datazz	Hard to Earn	1994	[Verse 3]	"I heard some hardheaded punks wanna see me
Jealous of a nigga just because he's on TV
You know, the video shows that you be watchin'
Call up and request so you can see it more often
My persona sheds more light than a nova
'Cause niggas are soldier, yo, this war, it ain't over
And ain't no stopping like McFadden and Whitehead
You might get dead, fuckin' around like you do
Pursue the knowledge that's available
Before your chump-style game and your punk friends fail you
Gonna dissect your brain for a minute
Look at your puny-ass world and what's in it
Nothin', that's how long you've been frontin'
I figured by now that you'd have come up with somethin'
But you're still the same snake with my name on your mind
Wanna know what I'm doin', wanna know why I shine?
'Cause I'm the rebirth, so now you gotta see me first
I kick more facts than paperbacks for research
And knees hurt, next, you feel 'em bucklin'
The huge pussy look on your face reveals the sucker
Inside of you, because I checked the way you're ridin' the
Jimsome, better sing more than a hymn, son
Never sustain the true pain of my wisdom
Never be able to touch Gang Starr
True indeed, I believe in takin' my words far
Across the seas and deserts, through the trees and grass
And if you ain't on point, then we comin' for that ass"
Eminem	15	Underground	Relapse	2009	[Verse 3]	"Tell the critics I'm back and I'm comin' to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions, then split a bag of Funyuns
Mad at me? Understandable, cannibal, shoot an animal
Out of a cannon and have 'em catapult at an adult
Captain of a cult with an elite following
To turn Halloween back into a trick-or-treat holiday
Have Michael Myers lookin' like a liar, swipe his powers
Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
Hit Jason Vorhees with a 40; stuck a suppository
Up his ass, and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lector a fuckin' nectarine
And sat him in the fuckin' fruit and vegetable section
And gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm Street with a fuckin' Wiffle bat drew
Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands too
And came out with a little scratch, ooh
Lookin' like I got in a fuckin' pillow fight with a Triple F.A.T. goose
Insanity, can it be vanity?
Where's the humanity in having a twisted fantasy
With an arm-and-leg amputee?
Straitjacket with a hundred and eight brackets
And a strap that wraps twice around my back
Then they latch it; cut your fuckin' head off
And ask where you're headed off to
Get it? ""Headed off to?"" Medic, this headache's awful!
This anesthetic's pathetic, so is this diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushin' my hard taco"

Scared of heights, so I might pass out if he flies
Keep him on autopilot 'cause I can't drive
Room enough for one, I tell my homies they can't ride
Unless they sitting on the shoulders, but that's way too high
Let's try not to step on the children
The news cameras filming this walking project building
Now there's hoes selling holes like right around the toes
And the crackheads beg at about the lower leg
There's crooked police that's stationed at the knees
And they do drive-bys like up and down the thighs
And there's a car chase going on at the waist
Keep a vest on my chest, I'm sitting in my room
As I'm looking out the face, something to write about
I still got some damage from fighting the White House

It's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Ain't 'bout no suckin' and touchin', just harmless discussion
Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations – would that be OK?
I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you
The anticipation of love makin'
Got you shakin' when I'm standin' near you
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
Now the picture's gettin' clearer
All he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave him, and you tell me keep my faith in God
I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone
And find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you don't deserve it
I contemplate – but in my heart I know you worth it
Tell me, can you get away?
Ebony, can you get away?
C'mon… Let's go… Can you get away?
Can you get away?"

I'm like shit, the fo' fif's still in the house
And usually niggas shoot from where you from, come out they mouth
Got a nigga heart beating like a cutlass truck
But my mama raised a G and she don't fuck with punks
Niggas rolled down the window, couldn't tell who it was
Waving off the chronic smoke, is they Blood or Cuz?

But I still filled the notes with real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find like a remote
Control, rap is out of
Used to, but still got love
That's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs like Tiger Woods in the hood
Should have my own reality show called ""Soul Survivor""
I stole on live-er niggas than you
You's a bitch, I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me?
They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me
Marsha's too sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
Too many featured MCs, and producers is popular
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin' a
Album, how come you the hot garbage of
The year? It's clear your image is looped up
Label got you souped up, tellin' you you sick
When you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster, chimped up
With a pimp cup, illiterate nigga, read the infra-
Red across your head, I'm bred king like Simba
Bolder than Denver, I ain't a mad rapper
Just a MC with a temper
You dancin' for money like Honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spittin' through wires and fires, MCs retirin'

I gotta protect my name and what we fought for
Southernplayalistic ATLiens in your sock drawer
No lockjaw, we got that raw shit and all the trimmings
Even though we got two albums, this one feel like the beginning
The intro, the Goodie—we kinfolk
Nigga, it's fin to jump off
But now it's time I lay low
'Cause I believe the track gon' cut off
Psych, the track is bumpin' like pussies on some dykes

Back from a show I had came, hopped off the plane
In my mind home was pictured and rest was the frame
My guy came to grab me in something less than a Caddy
Go buy them gas and food was less than a cabby
As we approach my tilt, paranoia in my bones had built
By the lock on the door, a hole was drilled
I opened it to the kitchen floor my heart knelt
In my shit, somebody had broke in like a mitt
My mind started swinging and who I thought the glove fit
As usual, niggas is suspects
Who did I tell I was going out of town?
Not too many people, I guess the word got around
The people upstairs should have been disturbed by the sound
Must have came in during the day when at work they was found
At the mound I stand vocal pitch high, asking who done it
Fuck Hitchcock, I got the fifth cocked, about to go Wild Hundreds
Whoever did it had the nerve to chill, and get blunted
And left a roach in the ash tray I had cleaned out the last day
Before I left, this thief decided to play chef
Overlooked beef in the fridge to cook chicken breast
I'm kicking what shit was left all around the house
Thinking whoever came in on me is out"

Jack moves, black fools 'cause I smack fools
Tryin' to set me up for a two-eleven
Fuck around and get caught up in a one-eight-seven
But I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggas like lynchin', but I just watch 'em hang
So on and so on, why don't you let me roll on?
I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak
Now everybody peepin' out they window when they hear me beatin' up the street
Is it Dre? Is it Dre?

But at the same time these dimes keep me feeling tight, I'm so confused
Okay I'm getting weeded now
I know I contradicted myself, look, I don't need that now
It's just once in a blue when there's nothing to do
When the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through

Bloody naked, clingin' to life
Unaware of his surroundings or if breathin' is right
In the arms of his mother as he looks in her eyes
He takes his first breath and he screams (baby's alive)
At the same time, another mother, murders her kids
And the unbearable thought of this here just brings me to tears
It's hard enough we gotta raise our kids to live in this world
So full of hate with no faith, and killin' your pearls
And sometimes, I sit it down, and wonder myself
But then again, I ain't Jesus, and I couldn't help
All I can do, is hope I never live with the fact
That I hurt one of my seeds ‘cause dealin’ with that
Would be the hardest thing, I’d ever have to do in my time
I'd have to take my own life too, and I couldn't climb
The stairway that you hear me singin' bout in my rhyme
And a parent hurtin' his kid ain't decidin' the time
I know it's truth, the next day, we just livin' to die
But I believe if you livin' right, you'll live in the sky
Lookin' down on the good and the bad, the world as a whole
And hopefully you did what you did, before you had to go"

Hennessy makes me think my enemy is getting close
Boom-boom-boom! Got me shootin' at a ghost
Some call me crazy but this is what you gave me
Amongst the babies who raised up from the slavery
I sport a vest and hit the sess to kill the stress
Moved out west and I invest in all the best
Those who test will find a bullet in they chest
Put to rest, by a brotha who was hopeless
Grow up broke, on the rope of insanity
How many pistols smoking comin' from a broken family?
I'm sick of being tired
Sick of the sirens, bodybags, and the guns firin'
Tell Bush, ""Push the button!"" 'cause I'm fed
Tired of hearin' these voices in my head

Kendrick Lamar	16	Auntie Diaries	Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers	2022	[Verse 4]	"Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
Remember church, Easter Sunday?
I sat in the pew, you had stronger faith
More spiritual when these dudes were living life straight
Which I found ironic 'cause the pastor didn't see him the same
He said my cousin was going through some things
He promised the world we living in was an act on abomination
And Demetrius was to blame
I knew you was conflicted by the feelings of preacherman
Wondering if God still call you a decent man
Still, you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint
Until he singled you out to prove his point, saying
""Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
Church, his auntie is a man now,"" it hurt
You the most 'cause your belief was close to his words
Forcing me to stand now
I said, ""Mr. Preacherman, should we love thy neighbor?
The laws of the land or the heart, what's greater?
I recognize the study she was taught since birth
But that don't justify the feelings that my cousin preserved""
The building was thinking out loud, bad angel
That's when you looked at me and smiled, said, ""Thank you""
The day I chose humanity over religion
The family got closer, it was all forgiven
I said them F-bombs, I ain't know any better
Mistakenly, I ain't think that you'd know any different
See, I was taught words was nothing more than a sound
If ever they was pronounced without any intentions
The very second you challenged the shit I was kicking
Reminded me about a show I did out the city
That time I brung a fan on stage to rap
But disapproved the word that she couldn't say with me
You said, ""Kendrick, ain't no room for contradiction
To truly understand love, switch position
'Faggot, faggot, faggot,' we can say it together
But only if you let a white girl say 'Nigga'"""

André 3000	27	Wailin’	ATLiens	1996	[Verse 2]	"I felt the pressure like sun shining, while rainin' (Wailin')
At the same time, I kept on rhymin', not complaining
Storm brainin' cats and dogs, my catalog be the size of golf balls (Wailin')
Throw up your Daisy Dukes I'm Hazzard-ous to all you Boss Hoggs
And Rosco P. Col' people, who caboose my locomotive (Wailin')
But enough of that, everyone can rap but let's say gift, suppose if
I use my gift of gab to boast and brag in every rhyme I (Wailin')
Compose, won't y'all get sick of that, 'cause I know I do when I hear those
Flows that ain't hip-hop, you find that shit in the gift shop (Wailin')
But to each his own, my speech is born
Keep that shit up outta my zone
Long as you happy, then I'm happy (Wailin')
Even if you just hate my fuckin' guts, go 'head and dap me

And then go home and pray for your ass later (Wailin')
'Cause we might need you in this war, I'm wailin' on you traitors

Prodigy	8	Still Shinin’	Hell On Earth	1996	[Verse 1]	"To all my niggas uncivilized to civilized
We cook the shake, move the weight across the tri-state
Them jux niggas bring the shook up out the crook type
Special deliver, sendin' shots through your Ac' Vigor
My Infamous Mobb get on they job
The truth gets revealed like we W Fard
Some shiesty New York niggas thirsty for cheddar
You shinin'? You get your jewels taken with your Hill sweater
Keepin' these rap fans like crack fiends
Until we re-up and put more Infamous up on the rap scene
Mix the coke rhymes with beats just like baking soda
Albums is G-packs selling across foreign waters
My Mobb picks is like dime bricks
Satisfaction, guaranteed real shit
Rapper Noyd, we meet you at the top, kid
And once we all on top, ain't no stoppin' it
I'm headstrong, at peace with myself like Islam
Stupid, a hundred niggas form around me
Like forcefield, pull out and use the gun like shield
The crew is worldwide, to think we started from the hill
Beware of quiet niggas laying in the cut (For what?)
Patiently watching, waiting for a come-up
Get your spot took, we rob land like white man
Plans to overthrow your whole shit while shakin' your hand (Motherfucker)"

Puncture ya temple and make ya brains shake
I'mma get ya, hit ya, nigga, makes no mistakes

When you gone, feel the pain so strong deep in my chest
When I got arrested, came so close to goin' to jail
Throwin' blows at the po-pos breakin' ya nails
Screamin' loud goin' all out, damn I did
You stayed locked down at moms house, watchin' the kids
Through the whole bid in the V-I, I see ya daily
While my fake homies try to fuck you, you run and tell me
That's why I stay committed, I thank God every time I hit it
Hopin' you'll forgive me for all the times I bullshitted
Me and you against the world, we untouchable
Screamin' like you dyin' every time I'm fuckin' you
Ya never had a father or a family, but I'll be there
No need to fear so much insanity, and through the years
I know ya gave me your heart, plus
When I'm dirt broke and fucked up, ya still love me"
Kendrick Lamar	16	These Walls	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 3]	"These walls could talk, they'd tell me to go deep
Yellin' at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that's my religion
Walls feelin' like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don't know how long I can wait in these walls
I've been on the streets too long
Lookin' at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must've missed them
I'm not involved, I'd rather diss 'em
I'd rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon' crush"

Out in New York, the same shit is goin' on
The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block, your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together — what up, son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets, I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, 'cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote, you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home, the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V.I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home, I'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized, time flies, though incarcerated, your mind dive
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for real-a
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love"
Nas	9	Can’t Forget About You	Hip Hop Is Dead	2007	[Verse 1]	"There comes a day in your life when you wanna kick back
Straw hat on the porch when you old perhaps
Wanna gather your thoughts, have a cold one
Brag, to your grandkids on how life is golden
So I'mma light a cigar in the corridor of the crib
Pictures on the wall of all the things that I did
All the money and fame, 8 by 10's
Of the whole Rat Pack inside of a big frame
Colliding with big names that could've made your career stop
All that, and your man is still here and I'm still hot
Wow, I need a moment y'all
See I almost felt a tear drop"
JAY-Z	6	The Story of O.J.	4:44	2017	[Verse 2]	"Financial freedom my only hope

I bought some artwork for one million

Few years later, that shit worth eight million
I can't wait to give this shit to my children
Y'all think it's bougie, I'm like, it's fine
But I'm tryin' to give you a million dollars worth of game for $9.99
I turned that 2 to a 4, 4 to an 8
I turned my life into a nice first week release date
Y'all out here still takin' advances, huh?
Me and my niggas takin' real chances, uh
Y'all on the 'Gram holdin' money to your ear
There's a disconnect, we don't call that money over here, yeah"

You devils are so two-faced
Wanna see me locked in chains, dropped in shame
And gettin' stalked by these crooked cops again
Fuckin' with the young Black male, tryna stack mail

I told the judge I'm in danger
And that's why I had that .4-5 with one in the chamber
Fuck the world!"
2Pac	18	Point the Finga	Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...	1993	[Verse 1]	"I thought I hit rock bottom, they ban my album, point the finga
I guess nobody loves a real nigga-slash-rap singer
I thought I'd bring a little truth to the young troops
I brought proof that the niggas need guns too
It's not to be a racist, but let's face this
Wouldn't you if we could trade places?
I got lynched by some crooked cops, and to this day
Them same motherfuckers on the beat gettin' major pay
But when I get my check they takin' tax out
So, we payin' for these pigs to knock the blacks out
Ain't that a bitch, some officers are gettin' rich
Whoopin' on thugs and robbin' drug dealers for they shit
As far as jealousy, bein' a celebrity
No matter who committed the crime, they all yell at me
And the media is greedier than most
You could sell 'em your soul or they'll be on ya til a nigga's ghost
And everyday I read the paper there's another lie
They show my picture for the crimes of another guy
Now how's that for the life of a big shot
A dead cop, a lawsuit, a little kid shot
I play them nuttin' ass marks in the park
For tryin' to earn they stripes in the dark
Just 'cause I come there, don't mean I'm from there, peep
Only jealous motherfuckers beef, and point the finga"

Lookin' for a better way
My brothers and sisters, it's time to bail
‘Cause even thug niggas pray
Hopin' God hear me, I entered the game, look how much I changed
I'm no longer innocent – casualties of fame
Made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
And I swear I seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
When I gave her the keys to her own house, ""This yo land
Your only son done became a man""
Watchin' time fly, I love my people, do or die
But I wonder why we scared to let each other fly
June 1-6, '7-1, the day
Mama pushed me out her womb, told me, ""Nigga, get paid!""
No one can understand me – the black sheep
Outcasted from my family, now packin' heat
I run the streets, a young runaway, live for today
When he die, I can hear him say… (Thug Life, baby! I heard that nigga say...Westside!)"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Sunshine	Lupe Fiasco’s Food & Liquor	2006	[Verse 3]	"Relationship is just thirty minutes long
It's kinda heavy, maybe a little strong
Gonna take much more than once
Can't trust what each of us say at least for a month
Or two, before I bid you adieu
Do this one thing for me; out of the trillions
Of numbers that's in the world, just leave me a few
That lead to you
Won't be long then, I'll see you in the morning
Cool?"
Kurupt	4	Smooth	Dogg Food	1995	[Verse 2]	"Now, I’m a bonafide microphone technician wit' styles
I came to storm on these MC's like electrical clouds
Hear me now — a Born Killer like Mick n' Mall'
Down to trip and empty clips, and permanently exile
The oppositions, competition — discrete and dismantled
Light ‘em up like candlesticks wit' the instinct of a vandal
Vandalize, how I reprimand MC's to freeze
Movin' guarantees the temperature's decreased degrees
Frozen stiff, 'cause what I’m holdin’ lifts the soul
This mental automatic weapon keeps me in control
Never fold, I scald like water in order to let these MC's know I slaughter
So time's gettin' shorter
It sorta limits ya, but to me, the sky’s the limit
Ya know I diminish ya to dust, TEC's sinister
Bust one rhyme that’s like a voodoo hex
Connect complex styles wit' my vast high-tech flex
'Cause when there’s an MC like me who’s in there like swimwear
Don’t despite me, 'cause all the hoes like me, mashin’ in Nikes
I done seen niggas on TV, dissin' to get deals
Now, I got one question, nigga — how does it feel?
Check ya game, but I ain't even sayin' no names
Proclaimed lyricist dissin’ this for fortune and fame
Did I do somethin' to ya? Did we serve ya hoes?
'Cause your on TV rappin’ like ya knew me and know me
But you don’t really know me
Dat muthafuckin' nigga from Tha D-P-G! Tha K-U-R-U-P-T!
I’m too smooth (Muthafucka)"

Now you know you love your own now
Hit the stage, they got their hands up, don't put your nose down
I ain't knockin', nigga, I knocked the door down, for sure now
Whole crew, I swear they countin' on me
Gold chains, gold rings, I got an island on me
Houses on me, he got them ounces on him
Holy Father, come save these niggas, I'm stylin' on 'em
Good Lord, I see my good fortune in all these horses
I'm drivin' too fast to stop, so all these signs, I ignore them

Still battlin' in this racial war
Tryin' to find solutions to the situation I'm facin'
Only thing that's free is my flow that yall be chasin'

I drop that knowledge like dropping books
Let's stop the crooks from robbing of your brains and such
Using welfare as a crutch
I'm in it for good
You enter my hood you won't be findin' much
Hope that when I'm gone ya'll remember this
What we stood for, fuck that fame and that glitz
It's beginning to look a lot like the ending
Got to be more careful, know what corners you be bendin'
Revelations getting impatient
Now I'm dead
Remember what I said
I'm gone

And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kon, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
""Oh my god, is that a black card?""
I turned around and replied, ""Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express""
Brains, power, and muscle
Like Dame, Puffy, and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle
You know what I've been up to
Killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise-colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips"
Big Boi	26	Bust	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse 1]	"Step into the realms of space where nobody goes
Only the baddest motherfuckers are the ones that are chose
Some of the coolest individuals on the planet we said
Best believe that we can buck or give a damn if we care
No collision supervision but my family is here
Now my mama taught my niggas that was under the stairs
One of those who chauffeured life and then was underprepared
But my hunger is the thunder, no wonder it can't be smothered
Or buttered up, buttercup, melt your sauce
You a Chuck E. Cheese bouncer chumpin' off the boss
What I'm tryna tell you now is that you're softer than soft
And I'm sick as a cough, did I mention it's raw?
Your predicaments flawed, flaw means fucked up
And serving out the oven not fried, slow roast
No coast, tuck your tail and hide
You scared?"
Nas	9	Smokin’	Stillmatic	2001	[Verse 3]	"Pardon but I gotta question of life now
Look at the nigga next to you right now
Is he real, fake or scared?
Do it like this, niggas, right hands in the air
Ball it to a fist and put it over your heart
Now let's say it all together, let the ceremony start
""I shall stay real, stay true, stay holdin' figures
Never put a bitch over my niggas
I shall never cooperate with the law
Never snake me, I'll always hold you down in war
If they take one of mine, I take one of theirs
I never break the oath to the death, I swear""
I swear that's how we pledge allegiance to the alliance
Of underworlds, killers and thugs, though the science
Of a nigga still yet to be found
So light up some green (Uh-huh)
And pass it around, just pass it around"

2Pac	18	To Live and Die In L.A.	The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory	1996	[Verse 1]	"To live and die in L.A
Where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggas hustle for the cash, so it's hard to knock it
Everybody got they own thing, currency chasin'
Worldwide through the hard times, worrying faces
Shed tears as we bury niggas close to heart
What was a friend, now a ghost in the dark
Cold part about it, nigga got smoked by a fiend
Tryin' to floss on him, blind to a broken man's dream
A hard lesson, court cases keep me guessin'
Plea bargain ain't an option now, so I'm stressin'
Cost me more to be free than a life in the pen'
Makin' money off of cuss words, writin' again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down sunset, likin' the sin
What's the worst they can do to a nigga?
Got me lost in Hell, to live and die in L.A. on bail"
Guru	20	Tha Squeeze	The Ownerz	2001	[Verse One]	"Who's the real criminals, take a look behind the scenes
Corruption and greed is commonplace routine
Guess it pays in many ways to have a few schemes
Shit, I know model citizens that ain't squeaky clean
You got dirty politicians, dirty judges and dirty cops
Everyone's on the take, the hood's filled with dirty blocks
How we gonna save the community, they worse than us
It's like a curse for us, police be the first to bust
Think about it, that RICO shits no fuckin joke
For them the evidence'll vanish in a puff of smoke
I been observant, I'll never be subservient
I guess you get what you deserve in this
From project hallways to courthouse hallways
Some prevail, most see jail, this happens always
Speed on, before you get peed on
All I need is more power, then I'mma put the squeeze on"

YKK on your zipper, lick you like a lizard when I'm slizzard

Burn my gas like race cars
Two bad broads with the bass on
I never met a girl that I'd wait for
I seal my deal like Jay does
All that and then some
Pimp real for real when I win some

You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made ends meet
Eating your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently, all I seen was Spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four-inch rims
Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents?
Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Bullshit, matador, matador
Had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty; apology? No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter of fact, it need interest
Matter of fact, it's nine inches
Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin' my percents
It's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is in more shit?
Porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is devastated, decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I picked cotton and made you rich
Now my dick ain't free"
The Game	13	Let Us Live	LAX	2008	[Verse 1]	"Yo, I'm hopping out a Phantom with a iced out medallion
Stallions on both arms, rocks on both charms
My Dominican chick looking like Scarface sister
Red and curly and she wake me up early
Cause hustlers hit the block when police change shifts
New York, California, different toilet, same shit
In Brooklyn I rock Timberlands, still toast cinnamon
Been gangster way before he dropped Many Men
Liquor in my system, voice raspy
Who I sound like? Don't ask me, that's my nigga, we classy
Him and Montega Jada our style superior to haters
You can catch me in the latest Marvin Gaters
Ralph Lauren suit tapered up, fly cause I'm papered up
Why these niggas keep hating on my Phantom?
I be out in Atlanta and body tapping, I'm probably strapped
Toast it up niggas"

2Pac	18	Old School	Me Against The World	1995	[Verse 2]	"I had, Shell Toes, and BVD's
A killer crease inside my Lee's when I hit the streets
I'm playin' skelly, Ringolevio, or catch a kiss
Before the homies in my hood learned to smack a bitch
I remember way back, the weak weed they had
Too many seeds in the trey bag
I'm on the train headin' uptown, freestyling
With some wild kids from Bucktown, profilin'
'Cause the hoochies was starin', thinkin' ""what them niggas wearin'?""
I'm wonderin' if that's her hair, I remember
Stickball, humpin' hoochies on the wall
Or takin' leaks on the steps, stinkin' up the hall
Through my childhood, wild as a juvenile
A young nigga tryna stay away from Rikers Isle
Me and my homies breakin' nights, tryna keep it true
Out on the roof sippin' 90 proof, ain't nuttin' like the old school"

My Js, they match her melon
You know it ain't no tellin' (Uh)
Rather go duck a felon
The bankroll tucked for bailin' (Uh)
When I lean, when I lean (When I lean)
Blew out what I'm inhalin' (Yeah)
This gas broke out, propellant (It's lit)
Back to back like a train
Think twice tryna derail us
The gang like the Goodfellas
Took off, propane propellers
She like gold watch, gold chain

Rakim	10	Put Your Hands Together	Follow the Leader	1988	[Verse 2]	"I create 'em, take 'em, shake 'em, then make 'em clap to this
Most of you rappers can't even rap to this
I made it faster, you tried to master
Syncopated styles, words flowin' after
Measures of metaphor definitions of more than one
Take it both ways, I'll be here when you're done
Remember, as the rhyme goes on, it's rougher
Soon as I stop, you had enough of
Followin' footsteps, you better turn back soon
Sucker MC's suck rhymes like vacuums
The style remains the same, the words is changed
Bitten, rewritten, recited, and rearranged
Sing along if your tongue is strong, it gets sore
Sing when I'm gone and it'll break your jaw
Wisdom flows so swift, I'm Asiatic
Is it a gift or automatic?
Static, I don't cling
I got a tip of my own and I don't sing
Don't understand? Here's an example
On why MCs and DJs sample
'Cause we don't have a band, it's just my voice and his hands
That's what hip-hop was, it still stands
The records we use are from mom and pop's collection
Find a break from a dope selection
And go to the store, then buy one more
So my DJ can mix 'cause that's what his hands are for
Years later, hip-hop got contracts
The chance to put actual facts on wax
My mind's the coach, the physical form's the team
The top's the destination, I'm the cream
And still I rise with somethin' pumpin' and somethin' clever
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together"
Lupe Fiasco	23	GHOTI	DRILL MUSIC IN ZION	2022	[Verse 1]	"Assassin's Creed, rapping it back indeed
Like a mansion that's lacking fees, tapping the blackest keys
Capture catastrophes like a camera feed
Ball like a can of peas, fall like Michael Jackson on anaesthes'
Mistaking maidens for manatees
Neuralink is now pirating all your fantasies
Mistaking the sanitation for sanity
My mistake, I'm mistaking staying for cannot leave"

Four ounce Mini-Me, I still can't believe it

I'd die before you grow up and be just like your daddy
Or your grandfather; call Uncle Zeb
Tell him I got a son and I ain't even in Harlem
I'm poppin Crist' wit'cha godfathers
Baron Davis and D. Mac, Darrius Rogers
Drop the top on the '71
With my face in the clouds, Lord spare my son

Not 'cause things the same but 'cause we lack the same color
And that's green, now that's mean
Can't burn his cross 'cause he can't afford the gasoline
Now if a Muslim woman strapped with a bomb on a bus
With the seconds running give you the jitters
Just imagine an American-based Christian organization
Planning to poison water supplies to bring the second coming quicker
Nigga! They ain't living properly
Break 'em off a little democracy
Turn their whole culture to a mockery
Give 'em Coca-Cola for their property
Give 'em gum, give 'em guns, get 'em young, give 'em fun
But if they ain't givin' it up, then they ain't gettin' none
And don't give 'em all, naw man, just give 'em some
It's the paper, some of these cops must be Al-Qaeda, nigga, uh"

I'ma need a whole day, at least roll doja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day?
'specially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de

And what you make in a year I make in one show
Now you wanna frisk me and search my ride
Call me all kind of names, try to hurt my pride
You're just mad 'cause I'm a young cat, pockets dumb fat
Talking 'bout, ""Where the gun at?"" I been there and done that
I'm through with that illegal life, I'm stayin' legit
I love to see cars come cruisin' by, playin' my shit
I walk around with six thou' without a pistol, my whole clique's wild
I'm rich, pal, no more sticks, I'm makin' hits now
I drink Cristal, I'm through breakin' laws

The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren but I'm raw
See, 'cause I'm the motherfuckin' Villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's takin' place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangster tip
Straight outta Compton!"
Kendrick Lamar	16	The Art of Peer Pressure	good kid, m.A.A.d city	2012	[Verse 1]	"Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, an orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales'll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin' sure to carry away
A flock of positive activists that fill they body with hate
If it's necessary; bumpin' Jeezy first album, lookin' distracted
Speakin' language only we know, you think it's an accent
The windows roll down, all I see is a hand pass it
Hotboxin' like George Foreman grillin' the masses
Of the workin' world; we pulled up on a bunch of workin' girls
And asked them what they workin' with
Look at me, I got the blunt in my mouth
Usually I'm drug-free, but, shit, I'm with the homies"
Travis Scott	33	Oh My Dis Side	Rodeo	2015	[Chorus]	"Oh my, oh my

Eminem	15	Marshall Mathers	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Verse 3]	"Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a three-sixty
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
""Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy""
My fuckin' bitch mom's suin' for ten-million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin'
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it, bitch: Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter, **** ******** **** ******'* * faggot
Talkin' about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Ugh!)
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin' and fussin' over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden, I got ninety-some cousins (Hey, it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey!)
And then to top it off I walked to the newsstand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help, uh, here
""XXL! XXL!""
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Aw, fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself"
Nas	9	Got Ur Self a Gun	Stillmatic	2001	[Verse 3]	"It's the return of the prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft
Sip Cris', get chips, wrist glist', I floss
Stick shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche
With the top cut off, rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go
Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough, where does he live? Is he still in the Bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watchin' my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? The back twister, lingerie ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keepin' it gangsta with ya (Uh)"

Gang Starr	21	Natural	The Ownerz	2002	[Verse 2]	"So natural, chicks in VIP come downstairs
Rush me in pairs, shouldn't have brought them around here
The rules say don't check the pimp, check the ho
Check the flow, I'm all up in the trap catchin the bankroll
My steel shank holds one in the chamber like Antonio
'Course I'm a stand-up guy, but you don't know me though
I'm righteous, but I might just unvail my portfolio
The plot just thicken and you've been stricken like polio
Who's so-and-so, I'm tired of the lackluster busters
It's the black General Custer, the king conductor to dust ya
Touch ya, cuz you had nerve to try and conjure
A way to surpass the master, but now I bombed ya
Skiggy-hair man style like Lee Archer
Five foot eight, Guru the Great, still a tree sparker
I see farther than you average rap pro's
Son here's a rattle, you've never seen battle
I'm a natural"
Snoop Dogg	0	Peaches N Cream	BUSH	2015	[Chorus]	"She 'bout to go in

Damn, her ass is so big

Uh-oh, there she go
That's that look all on her face
Shorty dancin’ like she knows
She's the baddest in the place, hey, hey
I wanna get with you (Freak, don't fail me now, hey)
So what you wanna do?
Got her freakum dress on
Them New Bs on her feet
And them bottles with the sparkles
So the other girls can see that she's paid
I wanna get with you (Freak, don't fail me now, hey!)
So what you wanna do?"

America's nightmare
I am what you made me
The hate and the evil that you gave me
I shine as a reminder of what you've done to my people for four hundred plus years
You should be scared, you should be running
You should be trying to silence me
Ha, but you can not escape fate
For it is my turn to come
Just as you rose, you will fall
By my hands
America, you reap what you sow

Cameras movin' whenever I'm movin', the family suin' whatever I make
Murder is stackin', the president actin', the government taxin' my funds in the bank
Homies attracting the feds when I'm bracking, look at my reaction, my pupils on skates
Let's think about this for a second
Tell me what you would do for aesthetic
Would you sell your soul on credit?
Would you sell your bro for leverage?
Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel they the only ones relevant?
Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel they the only ones relevant?"

Walk to the store for the rose, talkin' straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In they socks and they soles, niggas holdin' they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hopin' for mo'
With nowhere to go, niggas rollin' in droves
They shoot the wrong way, 'cause they ain't knowin' they goals
The streets ain't safe 'cause they ain't knowin' the code
By the foes I was told: ""either focus or fold""
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don't roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners"
Nas	9	Ether	Stillmatic	2001	[Verse 3]	"Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother, you traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child? Scared to smile, they called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TECs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I'll still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn, though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow (Burn slow)
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy (Ill)
Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all tryna take my spot, fellas?
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot 'cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now 'cause of your looks? (Girls, girls, girls, haha)
Negro, please, ha, you no-mustache-havin'
With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans, you wack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane, to Irv, to B.I.G
And Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons, ha
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z, damn, you on Jaz dick
So little Shawny's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gon' come out your fat lips? (Nigga)
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss"
2Pac	18	So Many Tears	Me Against The World	1995	[Verse 1]	"Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest, tell me, can you feel me?
I'm not livin' in the past, you wanna last?
Be the first to blast, remember Kato
No longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets, now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears"
Havoc	7	Cradle to the Grave	The Infamous	1995	[Verse 4]	"It had me stressed a little somethin', had my heart rapidly pumpin'
Niggas started cuttin', behind the bushes duckin'
My ears rung, I plunged a clip into the guns
Got grazed in the arm, one slug hit my son
He was bleedin' from the head, I couldn't believe it
We was defeated, if it was a case, I couldn't beat it
Felt like cryin' (The temperature's risin'!)

So to P I passed the iron"

Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe"
Common	22	All Night Long	One Day It’ll All Make Sense	1998	[Verse 4]	"Check it
I walk downtown to tempos and never lose the beat
Some people got ignorance confused with bein' street
On the, street of desire my body and soul meet
Arguin over thick broads and meals with no meat
Had the cold feet for a second
Mega-niggas in my box throwin suggestions
Had me checkin' myself and double checkin', I popped the resurrection
In the mirror I only heard my reflection
Let me hold mics, while you hold dicks and CD collections
And at MusicLand and Coop's, we can make connections
I meditate with confidence, to not chomp on cents
Outspoken like 30's but yet I guard my lips
Writin niggas with stripes, I hold posture with
Poppin shit to fat broads, wearin os-trich
Givin em voicemail, tracks are like County
To them I voice-jail/gel, if you believe in Heaven
Why is the choice Hell? Why is this choice Hell?
Why is this choice Hell?"

You better watch these niggas (en garde)

Dr. Dre	1	The Watcher	2001	1999	[Verse 3]	"Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs
They wanna hang us, see us dead, or enslave us
Keep us trapped in the same place we was raised in
Then, they wonder why we act so outrageous
Run around stressed out and pull out gauges
'Cause every time you let the animal out cages
It's dangerous to people who look like strangers
But now, we got a new era of gangstas
Hustlers and youngsters livin' amongst us
Lookin' at us now, callin' us busters
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us
Nigga, we started this gangsta shit!
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get?
It's funny how time flies
I'm just having fun, just watchin' it fly by"
Kanye West	5	All Falls Down	The College Dropout	2004	[Verse 1]	"Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well"

All they do is dish dirt and put her up on my latest
Itinerary, but since I tend to vary, see
I tend to carry more rumors than ten Mariah Careys
Tend to hurries, in ten places at once (Woo)
Plus she can't front, 'cause peep how I run mines
Ma, our time together is our time together, and uh
Our time apart is our time apart
So love Jay with your mind, girl, and not your heart

You sing for hoes and sound like the Cookie Monster
I'm the hardest from New York, my flow is bonkers
All the other hard niggas, they come from Yonkers
It's been years and you had the same niggas in the background
You're never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah or Crack Child
Them niggas there just suck, they no good
I ain't never heard a nigga say they like them in the hood
I'm back, better than ever, on top of my game

Some waves, some air guns, the days of the fair one is over for
Cats is colder than four below, wit self I go toe to toe
Wondering if it's for the art or for the doe
Though I know to grow a - gotta learn to let go
Though I know the doe I got to bring back to the ghetto
Arrows on Terot cards pointing to the grind
Po' livin in more prisons, pointing to my mind, shine the light up
Clench my fists tight, holding the right up
Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
Situations, and jobs get tighter
My man trying to get his weight and height up, c'mon!"

We can make a hundred grand, spend it in the south of France""

Got ready to walk it out like Unk in my John Lennon Chucks
That's when I heard murder
""You're killing me, you're filling me with sorrow
Sunrise, goodbyes, and missing you tomorrows""
I turn to see my dream, love supreme queen
Meanest thing on the scene cry
I drop my bags in a flash, that's faster
Than 180 on that dash, shirt to dry her tears
And wipe the rain from my dear like Dasher
You's the dame who's the username to all my passwords
The reason I get fly is Ibn Jasper
I even keep your picture in my passport
Love, love"

Sadness, but Dre is just a nigga that glad its
Sucka muthafuckas like you making wack jams
Because it only shows you how dope I am
Never try to ignore us
When I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigor mortis
Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure
You can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger
Dre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that's smart
A nigga that's paid to say what others are scared to play
We started out wit too much cargo
So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold
Yo, N.W.A - criticized for what we say
But I'm a do this shit anyway
Cause I'm the muthafucking doctor, never faking
Yo, Yella, kick the muthafucking break in"

You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience

(Can I borrow this?)
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)
Not over this shit (Stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you"

Half these busters switchin', lookin' at me mean, itchin'
Givin' suckers plenty space, have these bitch niggas snitchin'
Where are we now, guns found daily
The Feds trail me in hopes that they could finally nail me
For sellin' dope, they backwards make the track burst
Whenever I rap, attack
Words been known to explode on contact
Extreme at times, blinded by my passion and fury
Look at me laugh at my competition's flashin' my jewelry
You'd stay silent if you niggas knew me, truly effective
The shit you heard ain't do me justice, got a death wish, bitch
Run, but face being traced, by the infrared beam
It seems niggas ain't recognize my team
Ain't nobody holdin' you back
Explode the track to confetti
Unload it, 'cause niggas ain't ready
The life of an outlaw"

I told my wife the spiritual shit really work
Alhamdulillah, I run through 'em all

All this old talk left me confused
You'd rather be old rich me or new you?
And old niggas, y'all stop actin' brand new

Nobody wins when the family feuds
But my stash can't fit into Steve Harvey's suit
I'm clear why I'm here, how about you?
Ain't no such thing as an ugly billionaire, I'm cute
 Pretty much
If anybody gettin' handsome checks, it should be us
Fuck rap, crack cocaine
Nah, we did that, Black-owned things
Hundred percent Black-owned champagne
And we merrily merrily eatin' off these streams
Y'all still drinkin' Perrier-Jouët, hah

Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Niggas' names on paper—you snitched all summer
Streets don't fail me now
They tell me it's a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress
Set-trippin' all around
Ain't nothin' new but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-icans

I can't cry, ‘cause it's on now
I'm just a nigga on his own now
Livin' life thug style, so I can't smile
Writing to my peoples when they ask for pictures

Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggas copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love women

When in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter

While slippin' bullets at point-blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it

My man retired, I'mma takeover
Tell these halftime niggas break's over
I'm raw, hustlas get your baking soda
Too many rape the culture
Leave rappers with careers and they faith over
It's a war goin' on, you can't fake bein' a soldier
In the basement, listening to tapes of Ultra-
Magnetic, to the fact the messiah is black
I'll turn the TV down, we can take it higher than that
I wonder if these whack niggas realize they whack
And they the reason that my people say they tired of rap
Inspired by black Muslims and Christians
Pushin' cutlasses, dope, and other traditions
In the conditions of the city, the city
The city, the city, the city, the city

And set this crooked rap shit straight from Crenshaw to Castlegate
Like Pete and CL, I reminisce over days
From the streets of Boston to New York and all the ways
For certain niggas to blow up, and crime paid
But my praise goes to the most high
Cause some nights I got so wild yo, I almost died
Some stuff I got into, really scarred my mental
Pops wasn't tryin to hear it, cause of what he been through
Still, like my nigga Havoc said, sometimes you gotta
Hit your crew off, so they can make some bread
Cause no matter the weather, niggas be needin cheddar
And things in this world are more fucked up than ever
So let's make this bond to keep this hip-hop strong
You a man Baby Pop you know right from wrong
So stay out of trouble, and that goes for me too
That's what we need to do, that's my advice to you..."

I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangster type, what I recite's kinda lethal
Niggas know the flow that I kick, there's no equal
I'm murderin' niggas, yo, and maybe because of the tone I kicks
When I grip the mic and kick shit niggas can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore and slam
'Nough respect like a sensei, whoop ass like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossin'
Why don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson?
Take a walk through the hood where we up to no good
Slangin' them things like a real OG should
I'm stackin' and mackin' and packin' a ten, so
When you're slippin', I slip the clip in, but ain't no set trippin'
'Cause it's Death Row, rollin' like the mafia
Think about whoopin' some ass, but what the fuck stoppin' you?
Ain't nothin' but a buster
I'm stranded on death row for pumpin' slugs in motherfuckers
Now you know you're outdone, feel the shotgun
Kurupt, inmate, cell block one"

When you puttin' on your lotion, I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin', I could change how you walk
That's the swagger that you come with when you come from New York
I'm a hustler, I just hustle and the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin' you, I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets, girl, you know that's right
I ain't got nothin' to hide, baby, I tell you my secrets

Too young to understand the consequences of a man living a lie
I gotta get that money, I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas 'cause they funny
Twenty years of watching my mama tears got me heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong 'cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer, 'cause I'm a stunner
I sit back and wonder when them angels gon' call my number
Under my chest is a heart of a lion, I ain't lyin'
Bounty hunters got me flying with my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder so I'm bolder, Hennessy and soda
Hood on my shoulder, look in the mirror, I see a soldier"
Guru	20	Put Up or Shut Up	The Ownerz	2003	[Verse 2]	"Aiyyo I've seen the toughest of tough guys, the roughest of guys

Crazy degrees of difficulties
Remain mackin' chicks, O.G. shit, the Temprees
Please, you know my peoples want a lot, the corner's hot
We gettin' love on y'all block
And that's gangsta, but a lot of shit ain't
Believe me it ain't easy like you sleazy niggas think
Uneasy niggas blink, when I step to the stage
And don't flinch, don't move a inch, I'm 'bout to empty the gauge
I've witnessed the bad shit, sickness and sadness
Always dreamed about what I would do, if I had shit
Drop jewels infinite for the blind, deaf and dumb
Down with M.O.P. and Bumpy plus I just left Krumb"

Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind
See, I never take a step on a Compton block

'Cause them punk motherfuckers in black and white
Ain't the only motherfuckers I gots to fight

And jacked and fucked up
What you niggas looking at? You going
""Goddamn,"" 'cause it's the city
And for you to survive, a nigga gotta be a gangsta
And I'm a nigga you can't remove
Took out a lot of motherfuckers for tryin' to prove
To they homies that they can hang by dealin' with me
But once again in the end they D-E-A-D

Niggas aim, mainly, at niggas they can't be
But niggas can't hit niggas they can't see
I'm out of sight now, I'm out of they dang reach
How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
And choose a new spot, if niggas wanted you shot
I ain't a thug, how much 2Pac in you you got?
I ain't no bitch, neither
It's either my life or your life and I ain't leavin', I like breathin'
'Cause nigga, we can go round for round
Clip for clip shit, four pound for pound
Nigga, if you really want to take it there, we can
Just remember that you fuckin' with a family man
I got a lot more to lose than you
Remember that when you wanna come and fill these shoes"
Eminem	15	Rock Bottom	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Verse 1]	"I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
I'm 'bout to burst this TEC at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin' ballers while they flossin' in they Pathfinders
These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas
'Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless
Them snakes slither in the grass, spineless"
Kanye West	5	Welcome To Heartbreak	808s & Heartbreak	2008	[Outro]	"Ooh-hoo

No, no, no, no, I can't stop
Can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

No, can't stop having these visions
I gotta get with it

Eminem	15	Drug Ballad	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Verse 3]	"That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend?
Screw it! And what's a little bit of alcohol poisonin'?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow, you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Mari-ju-ana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
‘Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin'
Even though you wake up feelin' like shit every mornin'
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still got a lotta growing up to do
I still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew
But when it's all said and done, I'll be forty
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap
Babysittin' for Hailie while Hailie's out gettin' smashed"

Where you from, nigga, huh? Compton"
Kendrick Lamar	16	reincarnated	GNX	2024	[Verse 1]	"I got this fire burnin' in me from within
Concentrated thoughts on who I used to be, I'm sheddin' skin
Every day, a new version of me, a third of me demented, cemented in pain
Juggling the pros and cons of fame
I don't know how to make friends, I'm a lonely soul
I recollect this isolation, I was four years old
Truth be told, I've been battling my soul
Tryna navigate the real and fake
Cynical about the judgement day
I did past life regression last year and it fucked me up
Reincarnated on this earth for a hundred plus
Body after body, lesson after lesson, let's take it back to Michigan in 1947
My father kicked me out the house 'cause I wouldn't listen to him
I didn't care about his influence, only loved what I was doing
Gifted as a musician, I played guitar on a grand level
The most talented where I'm from, but I had to rebel
And so I'm off in the sunset, searchin' for my place in the world
With my guitar up on my hip, that's the story unfurled
I found myself with a pocket full of money and a whole lot of respect
While the record business loved me
I was head of rhythm and blues
The women that fell to they feet, so many to choose
But I manipulated power as I lied to the masses
Died with my money, gluttony was too attractive, reincarnated"
JAY-Z	6	Justify My Thug	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 1]	"It goes one o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, Roc
Five six seven o'clock, eight o'clock, Roc
11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, the party 'bout to pop
Then, Roc-A-Fella y'all, it's your boy S. Dot
And I ain't never been to jail; I ain't never pay a nigga
To do no dirt for me I was scared to do myself
I will never tell, even if it means sittin' in a cell
I ain't never ran, never will
I ain't never been smacked; a nigga better keep his hands
To himself or get clapped for what's under that man's belt
I never asked for nothin' I don't demand of myself
Honesty, loyalty, friends and then wealth
Death before dishonor and I tell you what else
I tighten my belt 'fore I beg for help
Foolish pride is what held me together through the years
I wasn't felt which is why I ain't never played myself
I just play the hand I'm dealt, I can't say I've never knelt
Before God and asked for better cards at times to no avail
But I never sat back feelin' sorry for myself
If you don't give me heaven I'll raise hell
'Til it's heaven"

Never stay at center, play the back and let your money grow
Most them niggas wouldn't be around if you was bummy, yo
Southside Jamaica, neighbor, yeah, that's where I come from
If you see a nigga with me, then it's more than one gun
Fly straight, soldier, ain't you tired of bein' the dumb one?
Or are you satisfied bein' another nigga's dunn-dunn?
We all know friendships turn to sour when you gettin' it
Some niggas hate me in the hood, but I don't owe them niggas shit
Smilin' all up my face like I don't know them niggas sick
But I can care less, I'm on the Island, and I'm gettin' rich"
Travis Scott	33	THANK GOD	UTOPIA	2023	[Verse 3]	"Still no pressure

Yeah (Yeah)
Last tape was filled up with slaps, I guess gotta run this shit back
Didn't like the way that shit went down at the awards, I admit it, it turned to a beast
This that shit right here that get me goin', after I pop me a piece
Way that we killin' the critics and killin' the hate, might gotta talk to a priest
The way we evolved and knocked down walls, this shit's outrageous (Ooh)
A quarterback calls, I don't like 12, except Tom Brady
Can't short my stock, I still stack tall, you still can't trade me
Storm's a minor but you know she livin' major
When you flyin' up this high, it ain't no cables
Shit so lit, what happen in Vegas, it stay in Vegas

Nas	9	Represent	Illmatic	1994	[Verse 3]	"No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxanne
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard, god, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom, then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Barkim, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs

Prodigy	8	Up North Trip	The Infamous	1995	[Verse 3]	"I got the powder, combine wit' the powder, and water
It oughta, drop in a half and hour
In the, form of oil, watch the cocaine boil
Keep my eye on it so the shit won't spoil
Then I pause.. and ask God why
Did he put me on this Earth just so I could die
I sit back and build on all the things I did wrong
Why I'm still breathin', and all my friends gone
I try not to dwell on the subject for a while
'Cause I might get stuck in this corrupt lifestyle
But my, heart pumps foul blood through my arteries
And I can't turn it back, it's a part of me
Too late for cryin', I'm a grown man strugglin'
To reach the next level of life without fumblin' down or foldin'
I got no shoulder to lean on but my own
All alone in this danger zone
Time waits for no man, the streets grow worse
Fuck the whole world, kid, my money comes first
'Cause I'm out for the gusto, and trust nobody
If you're not family, then you die by me
'Cause niggas will have you locked up
The snitch be your man
Givin' police the run down on your plans
But never goin' down like that
So I, shut my mouth and hold my words back
Illegal business, forever mines, fuck payin' taxes
The last kid that shitted and gave police access
To my blueprints, used names as evidence
Skipped town and I haven't seen the snitch nigga ever since
The moral of the story is easy to figure out
A lesson that you can't live without"

I'm fasting four days out the week, brother

I pray to God that you not lackin' when you off the meds
I pray to God she know them Cabo trips don't last forever

Why we up 3 a.m. on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go

You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see

When the time comes down for the tryin' I got nine
Reasons why niggas shouldn't step in my face
With the nonsense, 'cause I'm always heated and you can taste this
Audi little something out the seams a my trousers
With no hesitation I got a team to come clown ya
I down ya, so let your people know what they face
With the type of individual that'll bomb a sub-station
Kaboom! and everybody dies outside
There ain't no escapin' the Reaper so don't try
Go ahead, close ya eyes, who the next to step?
Face down, hit, bleedin' on the steps a death
Check yo self, you just been invaded by true soldiers

How many years a nigga been in the game, and I'm still so clean
I'm flippin' up the game and shit

And I, never hesitate to bang a bitch
I'm having millions, and I'm still banging Crip

Kendrick Lamar	16	Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter’s Daughter	good kid, m.A.A.d city	2012	[Verse]	"I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
""Hello, my name is Kendrick,"" she said, ""No, you're handsome""
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now, cool
""Where you stay?"" She said, ""Down the street from Dominguez High""
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
""Well, is it Compton?"" ""No,"" she replied
Then quickly start battin' her eyes
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful, ""What you tryna get into?""
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and, well
The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who can imagine? Maybe my actions'll end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless, we'll fuck 'cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted, in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius is irrepetible
Family history of gangbangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
""I wanna come over, what's up?""
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm tryna get off
I was in heat like a cactus
My tactics of bein' thirsty probably could hurt me
But fuck it, I got some heart
Grabbed my mama keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope, 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin' 'bout that sex
Thinkin' 'bout her thighs or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties, blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional pornstar when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem
I'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang"

Common	22	Retrospect for Life	One Day It’ll All Make Sense	1997	[Verse 1]	"Knowin' you the best part of life, do I have the right to take yours?
'Cause I created you, irresponsibly
Subconciously knowin' the act I was a part of
The start of somethin', I'm not ready to bring into the world
Had myself believin' I was sterile
I look into mother's stomach, wonder if you are a boy or a girl
Turnin' this woman's womb into a tomb
But she and I agree, a seed we don't need
You would've been much more than a mouth to feed
But someone, I would've fed this information I read
To someone, my life for you I woulda had to leave
Instead I lead you to death
I'm sorry for takin' your first breath, first step, and first cry
But I wasn't prepared mentally nor financially
Havin' a child shouldn't have to bring out the man in me
Plus, I wanted you to be raised within a family
I don't wanna go through the drama of havin' a baby's momma
Weekend visits and buyin' J's ain't gon' make me a father
For a while, bearing a child is somethin' I never wanted to do
For me to live forever, I can only do that through you
Nerve, I got to talk about them niggas with a gun
Must have really thought I was God to take the life of my son
I could have sacrificed goin' out
To think my homies who did it, I used to joke about
From now on, I'ma use self control instead of birth control
'Cause 315 dollars ain't worth your soul
315 dollars ain't worth your soul
315 dollars ain't worth it"

Now, I'd only satisfy you to fulfill my needs
The ho get to suckin', five minutes later we get to fuckin
Now the ho shocked, me just slipped off the rubber
I said OHH! (Ohhh!), NOO! (Noo!)
While I bust a hellified superfied nut, I had to go
Straight pimpin' in the city, shakin' ass and titties
Some bitches had the bomb puss, but some bitches didn't

And the only way out, is death or going broke

Spotted some hoes, tooted my horn at the bitch
The Riviera skated, my interior's the shit
Fifteens humpin', dropped the top some more
Countin' my doe, purchased 250 of some bomb indo
Floss through South Central, I'm on my way to the Eastside
We high, blazin' like crazy and don't know why
Feelin' good as fuck, on a hot ass day
And there's a pool jam right around the way
Niggas got hoes, but ladies in the world
They wanna play with their minds like little girls
I twirl my fingers in the air, run my fingers through my hair
Redbones to blackbones, darkbones to Redbones
Skinny girls come a dime-a-dozen
But I play hoes like Plenty Lenny cause I get pretty
It's all about game...
Cause with no game is hard to maintain, for so long man
From Long Beach, California
From Tul-sa, Oklahoma
Tonight boardin' New Orleans from Mississippi
I know you hold the key to unlock the door
From low pro's she rolls with gold thangs, we ridin' fo' sho'
So tell me how much money can one playa make?
And how much ass can one nigga break?
You're just a gigolo (ya know)

Rakim gets stronger as I get older
Constant elevation causes expansion
I write my rhymes while I cool in my mansion
Then put it on tape and in the city I test it
Then on the radio the R is requested
You listen to it, the concept might break you
'Cause almost anyone can relate to
Whoever's out of hand, I'ma give 'em handles
Light 'em up, blow 'em out like candles
Or should I just let 'em melt?
Then give 'em a hand so they can see how it felt
I'm not bold just 'cause I rock gold

I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns

We bi-coastin', keepin' our pockets bulgin'
We got the plan in motion
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns
I pass 'em to my niggas, come on"

Daz Dillinger	2	Oh No	Retaliation, Revenge and Get Back	1998	[Verse 1]	"Come and blast and Dat Nigga Daz will act rude
Coming through, murdering fools who claim to be hard
Pulling your motherfucker's hoe cards
Me, we're going back for you to say that
Prepare for battle, let the 9 rattle with pay back
Knowing where you motherfuckers rest and hang at
I'm in Long Beach, where the gangbangers hang at
Don't want no static, don't panic, we're packing cannons
Ain't asking for shit, nigga, cause we're blasting
See, we're The Gang, kicking dust to maintain
Bang on niggas for a living, busting on police and opponents
Be on 'em just for twelve figures
Money, dope, cars and bitches, to get me richer"
JAY-Z	6	Caught Their Eyes	4:44	2017	[Verse 1]	"Your eyes speak the truth when everything else lies
May pretend that we kin but the vibes don't fly
Bruh, I survived readin' guys like you
I'm surprised y'all think you can disguise y'all truths
I seen eyes wide as they're about to shoot
You can be a hairpin, off and you can trigger your roots
I wave to these haters, don't give me dap
You know the world can see just how phony you act, bruh
Y'all body language is all remedial
How could you see the difference between you and I?
My crash course was much tougher
Round friends who kill they friends
Then hug their friends' mothers
And show up at the funeral, complete with blank stares
Invisible ink, I had to read things that wasn't there
Memories may sneak down my cheek
But I could see a side-eye in my sleep"

The Game	13	Ain’t Fuckin’ With You	LAX	2008	[Verse 2]	"I'm rollin' 21's and over
Not the club, the dubs on that platinum Range Rover
My neck's so iced out, my wrists so shined up
I make hoes line up, see a pole, climb up
Brown sugar or light skin, black or white skin
If she could drop it low then she could be my night friend
Or my one night stand, if she got a nice tan
Before I leave I cut the light off of your nightstand
Back to the house, my girl wanna have real sex
Nah, I keep my kids like Britney Spears' ex
Take her back to the future, I ain't even here yet
And that line was fly, bitch I'm a Learjet"

I said ""Yo, can I speak to, um.."",  she said ""No""
""Hey, yo, I know I didn't call, I didn't wanna stress you
Go out my way to impress you, press to undress you""
See, I wanna get to know you
So I can show you what a strong relationship can grow to
But you gotta trust me, and you're gonna love me
Squeeze the phone and hug me, use your mind to rub me
Now, how does it feel when my mental massage ya temple
Telephone's hot from the vibes that I sent you
Now tell me your inner thoughts and deepest emotions
Next you see ecstasy's explosions
Now I'm comin' to see you to spend some time
I'm a romantic warrior, but is it a crime?
And if you hide your feelings and they hard to find
I wanna know what's on your mind"
Common	22	Real People	Be	2005	[Verse 3]	"Black men walking wit white girls on they arms
I be mad at 'em as if I know they moms
Told to go beyond the surface, a person's a person
When we lessen our women our conditions seem to worsen

I live across from it, some of it I do be in
I be showin' niggas lives like UPN, it's real people"

I used to have a lot of homeboys I ain't cool with
A lot of people that a nigga went to school with
Happy as hell to see the big dog doin' it
But wouldn't none of them believe it though (What?)
That I would be bigger than Kurtis Blow
I guess he was right, these are the breaks
Despite my mistakes and aches, I'm getting cake
To realize your fate through faith
'Cause we all gon' get that day (For what?)
To see if our life was straight
And see if we'll be able to walk through the pearly gates (Yeah?)
To see the man upstairs
On some real talk, homie, I'm tired of bein' stuck here
If I could, I would fly to the moon (Zoom)
Y'all probably think I'm trippin' off these mushrooms, I know"
Kanye West	5	Bittersweet Poetry	Graduation	2007	[Verse 2]	"And my niggas said I shouldn't let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
But I been thinking and it got me back to sinking
And this relationship, it even got me back to drinking
Now this Hennessy, uh, it's gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you having my child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe with you sexually
'Cause every time that I'd try, you would question me
Saying, ""You fucking them girls, disrespecting me
You don't see how your lies is affecting me?
You don't see how our life was supposed to be?
And I never let a nigga get that close to me
And you ain't cracked up to what you were supposed to be
You always gone, you always be where them hoes will be""
And this the first time she ever spilled her soul to me"
JAY-Z	6	Renegade	The Blueprint	2001	[Verse 1]	"Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (Bling-bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'
What I do through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown
When child support knocked, ""No, he's not around""
Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt"

Rakim	10	I Know	The Master	1999	[Verse 1]	"A-yo, who's the most explosive one yet?
Year round there was one left
Who flows express rhythms drum sets ain't done yet?
Blow like a trumpet till yo eardrums are deaf
Who pose a threat?
Yo- who's more ferocious- none yet
To the night dem' set mic trends and life ends
In sight, I see the whole world through a tight lens
Rhymes I write plenz' and kept a white Benz
Spend G's like hundreds and hundreds like tens
I get paid black, but laid back with mild manners
When I flip it's the opposite of doc Bruce Banner
Out the lab with soul and melodies in your ear
And just when it all seem clear I disappear
All you gotta do is holla'
Reappear like voila
The street schola'
I'm 40 deep like Ali Baba
Give the mamas something to talk about in the beauty parlor
Keep it hot like lava
Yeah, it's Rakim Allah"

Hit that shit, that's the shit
It smell like skunk
Skunk smell like that nigga over there mama
Some old funky-ass shit
We ain't nothin' but some low down dirty niggas
Keep it real, nigga, fuck you, nigga
You ain't giving me near a dime on this real motherfucker
Fuck St. Ides, it's an Olde E thing, baby
Stick with some of that Hennessy
Can I drink with you, fellas? Can I get in on it in here?
Fuck you, Capo, you ain't in, baby

We gonna see who the big mouth when I come back

Overachiever, I love chicks that puff cheeba in reefer paper
I hate the ones that blow up ya beeper
'Cause I, go in deeper, I only bone divas
Impregnate the world when I come through your speakers (ha ha!)
Fuck hot, my records got the fever
Niggas kick dirt, get ya whole block sweeped up
I creep up when the beef heats up
Caught him with his feet up and shoes off, 'bout to snooze off
Hatin', 'cause you can't turn the booze off
You dudes is too soft, why I don't fuck with you all
I might bark at X, or spit at The LOX
But, other than that, I don't be fuckin' with cats
Just me, Ty and B-High, thug it like that
E, Dame and Biggs, what's fuckin' with that?
Y'all can never diss Jigga, get nothin' for that

Emotional outbursts, tears and smeared makeup
They stated, he was guilty on all charges

A spin artist, she brought her face up laughing
That's when the prosecutor realized what happened
All that speaking her mind, testifying and crying
When this bitch did the crime, the queenpin"

I ain't got a pistol pointed whatcha hand up for
Gave up lost cars as something we fighting for lost following crowds
Look at a nigga now, it doesn't matter whos wrong or right I guess
Long as you fight for yours with all might I guess
This whole confutation, to much stress
Wars for the wrong reasons how our mamas looking at me
How the hoods looking at me badder-or-good looking at me
Mellowing up the shy day play by me

The baby came out, disfigured ligaments, indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby, 'cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drank more liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin' the word—
My morals went *thhbbpp* when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk off of his own employee
Now, don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me: I'm white, blonde-haired, and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happenin' to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Em-
-inem and Kim combined (The maniac's in)
In place of the Doctor 'cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm takin' his place (Mm-mm-mmm!)
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place
I told you, Dre, you should've kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
I'm a criminal!"

Make sure the system's loud when I mention
Phrases that's fearsome, you wanna hear some
Sounds that not only pounds, but please your eardrum
I sit back and observe the whole scenery
Then nonchalantly tell you what it mean to me
Strictly business, I'm quickly in this
Mood and I don't care if the whole crowd's a witness
I'ma tear you apart, but I'ma spare you a heart
Program into the speed of the rhyme, prepare to start
Rhythm's out of the radius, insane as the craziest
Musical madness MC ever made, see it's
Now an emergency, open-heart surgery
Open your mind, you will find every word'll be
Furier than ever, I remain the future
Battle's temptin', whatever suits you
From words to sentence, there's no resemblance
You think you're rougher? Then suffer the consequences
I'm never dyin', terrifyin' results
I wake you with hundreds of thousands of volts
Mic-to-mouth resuscitation, rhythm with radiation
Novocain ease the pain, it might save him
If not, Eric B.'s the judge, the crowd's the jury
How do I plead to homicide? Lyrics of fury
They're gettin' furier
A furified freestyle"

About that shit you thinkin' and that time you *gulping*, I'm 'bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I ain't as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Should've killed yo' ass long time ago

Beware if you wanna rock the Knickerbocker
Other nigga from the block what, they was selling O's
Like Wheel of Fortune, of imported cocaine
Just to feel important, it was ""Do or Die""
They was tired of being ""Po' Pimps,"" not for sure (Sure)
That was just a product of my common sense (Sense)

So the youngsters grows in ghettos, goes to prison
At a early age already know what's against him
So in order for him to survive
One day he must open up his eyes to the setbacks and rise
'Cause everybody wants a shot
In this land of opportunity, look at what this country's got
There shouldn't be nobody homeless
How can the president fix other problems when he ain't fixed home yet?
The Earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone
To all colors and creeds is to whom it belongs
I want land, mansions, banks, and gold
The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control
The world's natural resources, all its residuals
But then comes foes, I have to guard it with missiles
And I become the most wanted
But is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by Secret Service?
I guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels
So move over Colin Powell or just throw in the towel, yo"

I might of knew it by the way you gave me a baby
Then left a day before I ever saw the son that God made me
It's hard, maybe we can make amends, be friends
We're only hurting all of us for certain by forsaking him
Just take it in, don't even say a word, observe the way you were
Preserve these words so you won't play the herb
Ever again, never pretend that he doesn't have a father
I'm always there and you don't wanna bother
I honor my word on my father's grave
Guide him through his hardest age so he can thrive and survive in these modern days
I wanna raise my little man but you keep resisting
I'm insisting you chill for real before you come up missing
Listen, I don't wanna fight, I'd rather do what's right
A boy needs a father, that's the most important part of his life"
Guru	20	Comin’ for Datazz	Hard to Earn	1994	[Verse 1]	"I hit the chicks with the nice round heinies
Play a ho like a ho, play a sucker like Stymie
Try me and you'll descend into your end
Never thought it could be you, well, think again, my friend
My pen illuminates and dooms the fakes
You're soon to break, you're strawberry like shortcake
I'm in that ass with my Timbs all day
You couldn't tarnish my rep, so you crept away
Just behave and be a good son
Or else I'm bringin' the noise 'cause most emcees are puns
Used to chill in Roxbury, now I'm comin' out of Brooklyn
Herb niggas are assed out, y'all get tooken
Or taken, and that's word to all rude boy Jamaican
I swing, bitch, yes, I'm crankin'
Just like an Alpine, a deadly rhyme, brand spankin' new
Pumped to put some lead in your crew
A hollow point shot 'cause your weak shallow point's not hittin'
Should've gave up from the beginning
But since you're bluffin' with your tape that's trash
Tell your peeps that we comin' for that ass"
Scarface	11	Hand of the Dead Body	The Diary	1994	[Verse 1]	"We got this ho muthafucka on a mission
Now the whole entire world's gotta try to come up with a quick decision
They claim we threats to society
And now they calling on the government to try and make somebody quiet
For the bullshit they done to me
Gangsta Nip, Spice-1 or 2Pac never gave a gun to me
So gangsta rap ain't done shit for that
I've even seen white folks from River Oaks go get the gat
So why you trying kick some dust up
America's been always known for blaming us niggas for they fuck-ups
And we were always considered evil
Now they trying to bust our only code of communicating with our people
Lets peep the game from a different angle
Matt Dillon pulled his pistol every time him and someone tangled
So why you criticize me
For the shit that you see on your tv
That rates worse than PG
Just bring your ass to where they got me
So you can feel the hand of the dead body"
Scarface	11	The White Sheet	The Diary	1994	[Verse 2]	"I see your mama in the waitin' room, steady cryin'
I see your ass in the doctor's arms, slowly dyin'
Now talk that shit that you was talkin' to your homie
Bitch you should have shot me when you pulled your fuckin' pistol on me
So now I'm forced to pop the clip in
S to the motherfuckin' A, nigga set trippin'
It ain't no love when my finger's on the trigger
It ain't no love for you off balance ass niggas
So keep your ass in the neutral spot
'Cause if you rollin' through my hood while we feudin' then you gettin' got"
Havoc	7	Kill That Nigga	Infamy	2001	[Verse 1]	"If my nigga was my nigga like I thought he was
Would he have snitched, hung me out the dry to fuck?
Guess you don't know a nigga 'till you catch a case with 'em
It ain't all gravy just because you make cake with 'em
It's real, niggas scared to death of state prison
To the end when a nigga get caught start snitchin'
Imagine the eyes of a nigga that you knew
For about 20 joints with the nerve to point
Hurt worser than that physical pain
You fetish nigga roll with the sorry fuck, now he switchin' to lame
Niggas in the box could relate to my pain
All I got is my word and I'mma get you thats my word
Through family friends or even fuckin' your bird
Fuck it anything long as your death occur
Whatever happened to death before dishonor?
It's time for your end and it's my honor"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Die Hard	Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers	2022	[Verse 2]	"I got some regrets
I-I-I-I-I-I-I
But my past won't keep me from my best
I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Subtle mistakes felt like life or death
I-I-I-I-I-I-I
I wanna see the family stronger
I wanna see the money longer
You know that I'd die for you
I get emotional about life
The lost ones keepin' me up at night
The world be reminding me it's danger
I'll still risk it all for a stranger
If I told you who I am, would you use it against me?
Right or wrong, no stone, just love to send me"
OutKast	28	ATLiens	ATLiens	1996	[Chorus]	"Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, ""O-Yea-yer""

Everybody let me hear you say, ""O-Yea-yer"""
Common	22	Time Travelin’ (A Tribute to Fela)	Like Water for Chocolate	2000	[Verse 1]	"Yo, I was a piano player in my last lifetime
Now I write rhymes, sip white wine and let my light shine
Out the dark space, with the world on my mind like Scarface
Though my sex drive is like a car chase
More than a uhh, it's the piece of mind I chase
Stakes are high, like my uncle is
We both got problems, he never confronted his
Under the bridge I wrote, some shit to stay afloat
And paint a picture, raw like the first coat
Send my old man a note to keep his phone on
My little cuz'll know cheap tricks are homegrown
Travel to a place sweeter than home, listenin to Nina Simone
Repeat this psalm, to the sky I'm keepin my palms
Facin the east, actions macin the beast
Embracin the streets, my guy caught a case cuz he beat
His lady down, it's two-thou
That ain't the way we lay it down
Souls get, found and lost at the roads they cross
Many paid dues, but few knew the costs
I ran through the Moss like Randy
Touching down with God, close friends, and family
Recognize the voice in the wilderness
Com Sense, '92 and I'm still in this"

2Pac	18	It Ain’t Easy	Me Against The World	1995	[Verse 3]	"Lately been reminiscin' about Peppermint Schnapps
In Junior High, hit the block
Keep an eye on the cops while d-boys slang rocks
Just a project kid without a conscience
I'm havin' dreams of hearin' screams at my concerts
Me and all my childhood peers
Through the years tryin' to stack a little green
I was only seventeen when I started servin' fiends
And I wish there was another way to stack a dolla
Sold my Impala 'cause these hard times make me wanna holla
Will I live to see tomorrow? Am I fallin' off?
I hit the weed and then proceed to say, ""Fuck all of y'all!""
Ain't nobody down with me, I'm thuggin'
I can't go home, 'cause muh'fuckers think I'm buggin'
So now I'm in this high-powered cell at the county jail
Punk judge got a grudge, can't post no bail
What do I do in these county blues?
Gettin' battered and bruised by the you-know-who
And these fakes get to shakin' when they face me
Snakes ain't got enough nuts to replace me
Sittin' in this livin' hell, listenin' to niggas yell
Tryin' to torture 'em to tell, I'm gettin' mail
But ain't nobody sayin' much, the same old nuts
Is makin' bucks while these sluts is gettin' fucked
They violated my probation
And it seems I'll be goin' on a long vacation
Meanwhile, it ain't easy—
No, it ain't easy"
Nas	9	Watch Dem Niggas	It Was Written	1996	[Verse 2]	"Now how can I perfect this?
Living reckless, die for my necklace
Crime infected, driving a Lexus with a death wish
Jetting, checking my message on the speaker
Bopping to , brown reefer, 10 G's, gun and my Visa
CD cranking, doing 90 on the Franklin D. Roosevelt
No seat belt, drinking and thinking
My man caught a bad one, son, niggas is frightened
Secret indictments, adds on the one seeking enlightenment
My Movado says 7 — the God hour, that's if you follow
Traditions started by the school, not far from The Apollo
My 'fuck tomorrow' motto through the eyes of Pablo
Escobar, the desperado, word to Cus D'Amato"
2Pac	18	White Man’z World	The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory	1996	[Chorus]	"Who knows what tomorrow brings

To let you know that you're not alone"

And when they bang this in the club, baby, you got to get up
Thug niggas, drug dealers, yeah, they givin' it up
Lowlife, yo' life, boy, we livin' it up
Takin' chances while we dancin' in the party for sure
Slipped my ho a forty-fo' when she got in the back do'
Bitches lookin' at me strange, but you know I don't care
Step up in this motherfucker just a-swangin' my hair
Bitch, quit talkin', Crip walk if you down with the set
Take a bullet with some dick and take this dope on this jet
Out of town, put it down for the Father of Rap
And if yo' ass get cracked, bitch, shut yo' trap
Come back, get back, that's the part of success
If you believe in the S, you'll be relievin' your stress"
Lupe Fiasco	23	The Instrumental	Lupe Fiasco’s Food & Liquor	2006	[Verse 2]	"He just sits, and listens to the people in the boxes
Everything he hears, he absorbs and adopts it
Anything not coming out the box, he blocks it
See, he loves the box and hope they never stop it
Anything the box tell him to do, he does it
Anything it tell him to get, he shops and he cops it
He protects the box, locks it in a box
When he goes to sleep, but he never sleeps
'Cause he stays up to watch it, scared to look away
'Cause at that moment, it might get stolen
And that's the last of the boxes"
The Game	13	Church For Thugs	The Documentary	2005	[Chorus]	"Believe me, niggas keep sayin' they gon' heat me up
Talkin' that shit like they gon' lay me down

Niggas really don't want no parts of me pal

The Game	13	Just Another Day (The Documentary 2)	The Documentary 2	2015	[Verse 1]	"Just the other day, I saw a hologram of Eazy around my way
I started to pray, I hopped up in that Maybach
I know I said I wouldn't but sometimes a nigga gotta crossover like A.I
I crossover like Steph Curry, crossover like CP
But I will not crossover so niggas can buy the CD
This NWA ha, smokin' that Bombay, we stay high
Niggas is killin', we out the way ha
I think about the day I first met Dre
I got my Aftermath Chain, I iced out the A
I stayed on some gangsta shit but still bump that De La
Dippin' down Green Leaf, Cherry Six Tre
I felt like I ain't need your love, wrote the song ""Hittin' Switches"", then I recorded the shit with Faith
I did the BET Awards with Mary J
I stayed on top of California like the bay niggas"

Better luck next time

Kendrick Lamar	16	United in Grief	Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers	2022	[Verse 3]	"So what? Paralyzed, the county building controlled us
I bought a Rolex watch, I only wore it once
I bought infinity pools I never swimmed in
I watched Keem buy four cars in four months
You know the family dynamics on repeat
The insecurities locked down on PC
I bought a .223, nobody peace treat
You won't doo-doo me, I smell TNT
Dave got him a Porsche, so I got me a Porsche
Paid lottery for it, I ain't want it in portions
Poverty was the case
But the money wipin' the tears away"

Grab my blunt and pull my dick up out this bitch mouth (getting that ass)
I'm feeling like making this bitch iron my clothes or something
Multitasking, cooking breakfast
Making a nigga wanna smack that ass
See, I met this bitch on Crenshaw, she told me give her a ride
I said, ""If I do that, you gotta give me head while Ray Charles drive.""
Cause I ain't, for, the tricking, no I ain't
I'm with my main bitch and my side bitch, I'm feeling like Saddam
They had the bomb,
And if her baby daddy tripping, fuck that nigga
I push that nigga hairline back like he LeBron
Make a nigga disappear like J-Kwon
Body found by the Swans
Nigga missing both of his arms, I ain't playing
I'm with the rat-tat-tat-tat, shoot a nigga if he do or don't die
He ain't never coming back
Now it's one, two, buckle my shoe
Patent leather Giuseppes nigga, watch what the fuck I do
It's the P-I-R-to-the-U

Yay yay, I said I put that on my momma I'ma ride for you baby boo"

""You got ambition?"" Shorty said, ""Man, listen
I got demands for livin', can't stand division

Women in the Expedition, no plans for prison
In a vision the city get, two milleni, G

Gettin' high, and watch life pass me by""

10 G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe you me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call I'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's 10 years, I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride

My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle
It's a damn shame what you're not though, (Who?) me!
Slick like a gato, fucking Jay-Z
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut, and he got a nut, and.. what!?
Straight bananas; can a nigga see me?
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son, you're too eager
You ain't having it? Good! Me either
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us, huh?

All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even

You hope that he get what he deserves—word!
Do you even remember what the issue is?
You just tryna find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is

Drive back to the crib, run back to their arms
The smokescreens, the chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means?"
Jay-Z	12	If I Should Die	Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life	1998	[Verse 4]	"I'd tell Big they're still hearin' his songs
Run into Pac ask him where we went wrong
Tell him life is miserable when ya dealin' in the physical form
Is everything that's invisible gone?
I need to know, will I still feel pain or will it be ironic?
Will I chill in the flames for all the ills of my brain?
Can I re, veal the game to all the hustlers
Trapped in the race and if so can I leave this place?
Can I puff cigars and drink Cristal?
If this is heaven to me is this considered heavenly?
Can I still touch lives, answer their ""whats and whys""
Make sure everybody in my fam' clutch five?
If I should die... don't cry, my niggas"

Psychotic, hypnotic product, I got a the antibiotic
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada-yada
God, I talk a lot of hem-de-lay-la-la-la
Oochie-walla-walla, um-da-dah-da-dah-da, but you gotta-gotta
Keep movin', there's more music to make
Keep makin' new shit, produce hits to break
The monotony, what's gotten into me?
Drugs, rock and Hennessy, thug like I'm Pac, on my enemies
On your knees, got you under siege
Somebody you would give a lung to be
Hun-ga-ry like a fuckin' younger me
Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free

Besides I'm in the mood so at high noon we ride
From coast to coast, niggas mash on every stage coach
My disciples with rifles lethal in whole posts
The off-the-rocker roller coaster
On a six-shooter holster
With DPG on every Wanted poster
Let me think about which bank to gank
Which fellow ta shoot and which teller to shank
I want all the shit you got in stacks
Attached to this skirt in the corner
So I snatched the bitch in the back
The Dogg in me feels for the lust
But the hogg in me makes me wanna bust
Back to the drawin down board
Nowadays we drawn down more
To survive thru all the round wards
Battle up or saddle up and shake the scene
Or get'cha pockets shaken, clean the slugs in ya spleen
I can't help it, I'm heartless, ya can't hack it
With my six-shooters on my hips and dusty jacket
Like that cock back
Quick to pull my strap
Just to put the Horsemen on the map

That's ""Godfather"" shit, back seat, next lit plans
Revolvers spit, I'm too tough to bargain with
And you don't want the God to pull up, the cars are sick
Arms and wrists is lit up, Queensbridge King
Plaques, awards, applause when I do my thing
Streets is black as midnight, the concrete gray
With stains of blood and germ and piss all day
Come on the Ave., get sized up plus appraised
Duck and pray that my guns don't bust your way
Niggas with names livin' off reputation
Sometimes gotta remind you — ain't nothin' changin'"

Never allowed, and break em up like a whack album
Go against the grain and get punished, fuck you
Take it out on who run wit, then touch you
Ain't no room for the both of us you pop too much shit
I just handle shit and put a clamp, on them loose lips
I sink em like the Titanic, you be deep in some shit
I didn't stutter can't hear nigga read my lips
Who you runnin' with - shit you won't knock this click
You just frontin' with imaginary pies you flip
Aiyo P my mind and yours put together's like a pack wild piranhas
Carnivores it's me thirstin'
It only worsen, you cats'll get the closed curtain
While your catch me on your networking, you dick jerkin
Your future's uncertain - get a grip close your mouth
Cause you know them shits sink ships
It's foul - tryna go against the morale
Move the crowd do my thing leave your ears aroused"

Your last dude, he was so rotten

Yeah baby girl I can read your mind
But what I'm really tryin to do is read between your pantylines
I know it seems oh so personal
But I'm just tryin to make you feel real comfortable

All so every soccer Terry Fox molding
Go ahead
Don't stop, go ahead
Sitting in your car, just listening to the bars
And there's traffic all around and you feel like falling down
And the music that I'm spewing out, enough to calm it down
'Fore you know you're out your car with your briefcase walkin' round
And them dollars from the budget that went to S1 Production
And Sebastian on the hook like being dug by Michael Douglas (yeah!)
So don't start that walk through Echo Park
When life's a one-on-one and you caught up in the jam
Just show some love back to your number one fan"

Now, they got me in the middle, feeling like a man-whore
'Specially the big girl
Big girls need love, too—no discrimination here, squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
And let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny-slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Yell out ""Timber!"" when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male-friend-boyfriend was boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail: on the low, ho"

Some of 'em lie about the guns they pop

That's how it is for me 'cause I live a boss' life
Now this is for the B's and the C's, and the D's and the H's
And the G's puttin' work in overseas
At ease with the Doggy and smoke some weed
Fuck it, if my nigga detoxing, it's more for me
Baby this is presidential really, a pocket full of women
Understanding how I'm living, show them hoes how you winning
It's the beginning with the pearls you're given
The world soft like linen and sweet like cinnamon
But everyday like 50 say, it's Many Men
They wanna take me out the spot, they want the pussy and the ends
But separate the paper and the Benz and the cribs
Then the hoes, then the clothes, I'mma have to let 'em go
You know how the Dogg roll, don't get it twisted
'Cause he bang out the East just in case you wanna visit
A touch of the exquisite, mixed with somethin' pimpish
And it's comin' from the Beach where them niggas is a beast
But I just listen, all that shit is in my past
I'm connected to the purse first nigga, the ass last
From Long Beach to Venice is the premise
Want the green like spinach and I'm strong to the finish"

Motherfucker, you can live at the mall

I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinkin' of my partner, put the candy paintin' on the Regal
Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day, my logic get another dollar just to keep you

Big L	25	Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous	Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous	1995	[Verse]	"My name is L, and I'm from a part of town where clowns
Get beat down and all you hear is gunshot sounds
On 139 and Lenox Ave there's a big park
And if you're soft, don't go through it when it gets dark
'Cause at nighttime niggas try to tax
They're sneakier than alley cats, that's why I carry gats
Yo, I'm a motherfuckin' fugitive
Buckwild and foul is the lifestyle that I choose to live
Because to me it's all about a buck
I used to have a partner in crime by the name of Chuck
We stormed the city, shootin' shit up like Frank Nitti
We robbed kids and split the dough 50/50
One day we stuck a dice game on the ave and split the cash
Then I murdered his ass and took his half
Because I'm all about ends and skins
When you got those, you don't need no motherfuckin' friends
If I catch you on a late night, black, you're gettin' stuck, jack
My moms told me to get a job, fuck that
Ayo, picture me gettin' a job
Takin' orders from Bob, sellin' corn on the cob
Yo, how the hell I'ma make ends meet
Makin' about 120 dollars a week?
Man, I'd rather do another hit
I want clean clothes, mean hoes and all that other shit
Yo, I admit, I'm a sucker
A low down, dirty, sneaky, double-crossin', connivin' motherfucker
Breakin' in cribs with a crowbar
I wasn't poor, I was po', I couldn't afford the O-R
I used to wait until it gets dark
And tell a nigga to strip, I wanna see some birthmarks
Like a ninja, dressed in black with a ski mask
I take all the funds, then I run down the street fast
I vicked this nigga named Eugene
Took his brand new ring 'cause sticking up's an everyday routine
Once I was cruising in a beat-up ride
Saw this nigga named Clyde
And snuck up on him from the blind side
I told him, ""Give up the dough, before you get smoked
Oh you're broke? *gunshots* Now you're dead broke""
The Big L was cold crazy
A top-notch crook snatching pocketbooks from old ladies
I don't care, I'll do anything to get a buck
Even rob a Miller truck, 'cause I don't give a fuck
Some say I'm ruthless, some say I'm grim
Once a burglar broke into my house and I robbed him
Plenty and many brains I bust
'Cause I was livin' the life style of the poor and dangerous"

New York niggas is trigger happy, got Pataki scared
This town ain't big enough for both of us and I ain't goin' nowhere!
There it is, plain and simple, like Jigga, my game is mental
While slow niggas better know I blow their brains out they temples
I'm into black magical torture, romantic, dramatical author
Compatible with the average New Yorker
A fast talker, like Tony when he gassed Sosa
The masked enforcer, out for the cash and the cho-cha
Smash the coca, bottle it up, watch the fiends gobble it up
If I roll up, you do what? Swallow the stuff!
I don't give a fuck anymore
I'm only 24 years old and I've already broken every law
I'm horrorcore, this is for the heads
Runnin' up in your crib, now if you still hidin' under the bed"

It weighs a ton and making my neck turn green

You can't murder a show nobody's at

'Bout to snap and go motherfuckin' wacko at any second
'Bout to cancel the show just as fans below rush the entrance
Plan is a go to wreck shit, cameras in all directions

The press is 'bout to go ape shit, bananas on all the networks
Commando with extra clips, I got ammo for all the hecklers
I'm armed to the teeth, another Valium, fall off the bed
Hit the ground and crawl to the dresser
Alcohol on my breath as I reach for the scope

So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me

Finger rolls, finger waves, closet full of old leathers
Old sweaters, old boots, that's a whole suit for some cold weather
New sale, two L's and some old letters

They like me better when I'm fucked up and ashy
My royalty check's the rebirth of Liberace
Stunt so hard, e'rybody gotta watch me

Long as the VS bling, look at that light show
In the hood they say, ""50, man, your sneaker look right yo
Just can't believe Reebok did a deal with a psycho""

My soldiers'll leave you wet, mane (Wet, mane)

Jay-Z	12	A Week Ago	Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life	1998	[Verse 2]	"Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell
We both came in this game, blind as hell
I did a little better, had more clientele
Told you put away some cheddar, now you cryin' for bail
Seventeen and I'm holdin' on to around a mill'
I could bail out, blow trial and come around on appeal
Had niggas thinkin' I was from uptown for real
I had so much hustle, plus I was down to ill
Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville
Down and dirty, down to fight to round 30
Freezin' on them corners, still holdin' my crack
Lookin' up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?
Came from flat broke to lettin' the dough stack
You tell them Feds I said: ""I'm never going back""
I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Real	good kid, m.A.A.d city	2012	[Verse 3]	"The reason why I know you very well
'Cause we have the same eyes, can't you tell?
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat 'cause plan A don't come free
And plan C just an excuse like ""because""
Or the word ""but,"" but what if I got love?
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse 'cause you're the girl I attract
I love second verse 'cause you're the homie that pack
Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don't love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love?
Should I hate living my life inside the club?
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason?
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?
Should I hate them for telling me ""ball out""?
Should I hate street credibility I'm talkin' about
Hating all money, power, respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?"
2Pac	18	To Live and Die In L.A.	The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory	1996	[Verse 3]	"It wouldn't be L.A. without Mexicans
Black love, Brown Pride in the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin' to see us all broke
I'm on some bullshit out for everything they owe
Remember KDAY? Weekends, Crenshaw, MLK?
Automatics rang free, niggas lost they way
Gang signs being shown, nigga, love yo' hood
But recognize and it's all good
Where the weed at? Niggas gettin' shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this motherfucker permed out
M.O.B., Big Suge in the Lo-Lo, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex with a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggas with me, O.F.T.B
They got some hash, took the stash, left the rest for me
Neckbone, Tre, Heron, Buntry too
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hopin' it pay
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly; to live and die in L.A"
Eminem	15	In Too Deep	Music to Be Murdered By	2020	[Verse 2]	"You're laying there with him, thinking 'bout me
He's asleep, you say, ""Let's meet around three""
You went to leave the house, he caught you sneaking out, now he's freaking out
You thought he was sleepin' soundly, woah
You say you're going for a drive, you don't question him
When he stumbles in, like, ""Where the fuck you've been?""
Then you pump his ear with what he wants to hear
Tell him you love him, yeah, wipe each other's tears
But it's been a couple years since we been doin' dirt
You or my girl, don't wanna see either of you get hurt
But now the lines are getting super blurred
Can't tell if I'm cheating on her with you or cheating on you with her
But really, nobody's at fault, can't help who you love
Hope they don't overhear us talk
'Cause we both are getting sloppy
Probably subconsciously part of me's hoping we get caught 'cause"
Scarface	11	In Between Us	The Fix	2002	[Verse 2]	"I know you hate me, don't you?
I bet you sit and wish my time never came
You'd probably rather see me die in the game
You'd probably rather see me die in a plane
Than to see me up on top of my dough
I get my money, shit changed
And niggas start looking at me different than this
And downplay the real nigga shit to get with a bitch
But I'mma tell a motherfucker like this
You only good as what you come up against
Nigga you get what you get
Sure the grass is greener on the other side of the fence
But any attempts and you gonna need the guy in the trench
I'm a starter while you riding the bench
You saying you a player, well I'm the one designing your prints
Something to go by, to let these niggas know I
Don't believe in letting shit slide, nigga gonna die
Best friends since high school seniors
With a homeboys demeanor
But let the bullshit come between us"

Broken tibias, fibias, yeah, fix me up
Sixty sluts, all of them dyin' from asphyxia
After they sip piss through a Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Dixie cups, toxins, boxes of Oxy pads
Enough Oxycontin to send a fuckin' ox to rehab
Wack job in the back in a black stocking cap
Jackin' off to a hockey mask at a boxing match
(He can't say that!) Yes, he can
I just did, faggot, now guess again
Better text message your next-of-kin
Tell 'em shit's about to get extra messy
Especially when I flex again
And throw a fuckin' lesbian in wet cement
Faggoty, faggoty, faggoty! Raggedy Ann and Andy
No! Raggedy Andy and Andy
No, it can't be, it can't be—yes, it can be
The fuckin' Anti-Christ is back, Dante
It's Satan in black satin panties
This is Amityville, calamity, goddamn it
Insanity, pills, fanny pack filled with Xannies
Through every nook and cranny, lookin' for trannies
Milk and cookies spilled on my silk négligée, looky
Razor-ba-lades with me to make you ba-leed
Cases of Maybelline makeup lay on a table of weed
Slim Shady? Shit sounds like a fable to me
'Til he jumps out of the fuckin' toilet when you're takin' a pee"
Rakim	10	New York (Ya Out There?)	The 18th Letter	1997	[Verse 3]	"A-yo, we got five boroughs of ghettos with many places to meet
You get lost in busy streets, the city that never sleeps
Mecca, Pelan, Medina, the population increase
The desert and the oasis, New York, the far east
With Gods and sheiks, pretty Amazons for weeks
Player dons that fleece, the family's black sheep
Icons that teach but we all act unique
We got stats to reach, so we all have to eat
A mass of peeps, with they own masterpiece
The crafts' elite, we be goin' past the peak
The latest technique no other place get as deep
Who parks release some of the world's greatest athletes
DJ's and MC's and graffiti artistes
Who use walls and subway trains for marquees
We go back to b-boys, breakdancin', breakbeats
And it'll never cease!
And on that note, we say peace"

Rakim	10	Paid In Full	Paid in Full	1987	[Verse]	"Thinkin' of a master plan
'Cause ain't nothin' but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money spent
So I dig deeper, but still coming up with lint
So I start my mission, leave my residence
Thinking, ""How could I get some dead presidents?""
I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, ""This is a hold-up, ain't nothing funny
Stop smiling, be still, don't nothing move but the money""
But now, I've learned to earn 'cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe, I might just
Search for a nine to five, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistling this
Feeling out of place 'cause, man, do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric B. and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without no money, it's still a wish
'Cause I don't like to dream about gettin' paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
So now's a test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio, 'cause I'm paid in full"

A Cuban on the Southside sells for thirty three
I'm goin' twelve and out because the shit is hurtin' me
The dope is gettin' short up in New York too
We sell it for thirty three, they sell it for forty two
See what we gotta do is come together
They're tryin' to cut shit short, and they will if you let 'em
Now let's go out on a boat, yeah
Pretend to be lawmen, and come out with dope
But first we gotta find a bitch with nuts
A down-ass bitch, who doesn't give a fuck
Distracts the cops, on duty
Walkin' around shakin' nothin' but booty
That's when we make our motion
Comin' from a small little island in the ocean
The other group comes in from the Rio
Me, Lil' J, Big Chief and O-Beedo
First we'll hit 'em up with some gas
Then launch a missle on they motherfuckin' ass
That oughta get the shit to float
Come back home slangin' nuthin' but snow
Then the prices'll drop again
Niggas throwin' keys, payin' ten
You wanna get paid, mayne?
Well that's what you gotta do and you better let your nuts hang
You gotta let your nuts hang (Ha-ha)"

Common	22	Nuthin’ to Do	Resurrection	1994	[Verse 3]	"I tuned into BMX, and taped Farley on the tonemaster
Took the 6 instead of the 28 to get home faster
Then HPK was the only station that would fuck with rap
You was on The Shore by yourself cats'd (would) say ""Up your hat.""
What you could you'd make of it, if you was a gump they'd take your shit
Either fight or break for it, we'd go to the lake and get full
My drink then was Boone's and Red Bull
I remember swimming in Avalon, and peeing in the pool
I thought I was cool, with my ""Members Only"" and a bald fade
Walk to Walgreens to get the Sportin' Waves pomade
And soft brush, as we got older we would stalk, rush, and bang fags
Go to Marshall's and change tags, I snagged 'nuff niggas
In games of Off the Wall, and softball, ""Piggy one"" I would call
When I first got my three way callin', I caught marks tryin' to lie
Home of the original gangbangers, and ain't nobody shy"

Back then it came with the love and niggas wasn't trippin' over scratch
'Cause we took turns and we both stacked stacks
And if you had a customer, you had him for life
'Cause Brad the true hustler granted you rights
'Cause if we gonna stack Gs then we gotta get along
And he who disagrees then gotta get him gone
'Cause they be startin' to get paid and niggas wanna flex

And when they find you, they sending you to immortal ground
And ain't no coming back from that shit, you going down
Now you history with the quickness 'cause you was fuckin' up the business
Now what a way to end a friendship, shoulda been there
'Cause ain't no love for pawns in this game
Nigga, I'm relentless, leaving your mom in the pain
If your ass had to be got, then I got your ass
Rude boy mishandled the stock so I popped your ass
I'm so for dough that my mind flows in it for life

We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Mama say she wanna move South
Scratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work

The struggle for the right side of history
Independent thought is like an eternal enemy
Capitalists posing as compassionates be offending me
Yeah, suck my dick with authenticity
Yeah, Tupac dead, gotta think for yourself
Yeah, heroes looking for the villains to help
I never been sophisticated, saving face
Being manipulative, such an acquired taste
I rubbed elbows with people that was for the people
They all greedy, I don't care for no public speaking

Eminem	15	Old Time’s Sake	Relapse	2009	[Verse 3]	"Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon Wireless
A nice environment, surprised entirely
Hypnotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants
Taking lives of firemen; say ""Goodbye"", here I am again
Naked wives and Vicodin
Before I begin to get so high, pussy boy, I could spin
Vinn-vinn, fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench, coach, and throw it to him
There he goes in his trench coat, no clothes again
Baby, make us some french toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin
Show me nipple, I pinch both, and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse; if it's forced, it's him
Don't fight the feeling if you're feeling the force within
And when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain"
Future	30	Thought It Was a Drought	DS2	2015	[Chorus]	"I just fucked your bitch in some Gucci flip flops

You run up in them hoes and grab the cash and get your dash on
While you're chillin' with your homies and shit
And how my niggas kick the anthem like this (Biatch)"
50 Cent	19	Baby U Got	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Chorus]	"(Baby you got) hips to hypnotize
When you walk I can't help but watch you shake

Feels like you got a hold on me
(Baby you got) my imagination running wild
Infatuated with your physical, damn, I like your style"
Eminem	15	The Real Slim Shady	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Verse 2]	"Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him, and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win? Wouldn't it be weird?""
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo, shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me"

She want me to come into his house but I can't kick it
She want the whole dub-dub E, but I ain't convinced
Never met her she, but she met Sheck, she don't need a prince
Took her off the O into the D, she ain't take offense
Way we got it bouncin' off the boards we making prints
Wait until I step into the floor and then they commence"

I hear the sirens right out the chateau, run me the info
Tryna hear what you did, not how you came close
'Cause I get bobblehead like I done made pro
I made Italian bread like I done made dough
I be all around the map
Write a show 'bout myself like I'm Chelsea Handler
Or write a series 'bout my bitches like I'm Kelsey Grammer
Nicknamed the jet Jayhawk 'cause it's outta Kansas
You know it's Spaldin' in my top, I'm in my esperanza

With your model stances, you everything I know about it"

Havoc	7	My Gats Spitting	Infamy	2001	[Verse 1]	"Is it real like niggas claimin', ""stay to this""
Let me answer that question while I'm aiming this
Hear them one good time, is he faking kid?
Not bleeding like that, he gonna need a shit bag
Lay the fuck up, suck it through from a tube
A million dollars won't even put my feet in his shoes (check it out)
Niggas lose they life, hey that's nature
And niggas die when tryin' my gangsta, niggas
Straight pussy, I can smell that shit
There's only one way that I can duse that shit
Slugs comin' through, better move that shit
He was gangsta but he died tryin' ta prove that shit
Them QB niggas, too grimey for y'all
We stick together, fuck what you heard in the song
The 41st Side, and that love go long
Niggas screamin' out, ""dunn""
And we put y'all on..."

Scarface	11	Sellout	The Fix	2002	[Verse 1:]	"It's been a long time coming but now I'm back at it
Flipping the script, from balling back to gangsta rap classics
You know that shit that hit the hood and upset it
If real niggas respect it, the squares gon' rep it
I done came in here to bring it to you
The uncut version of ganstarism with the nickel painted Ruger
Quick to cock it on you, spark light in your eyes
The unexpected is happening to you now nigga, surprise!
Who is it? (Face, marchin', mobbin')
You said it one more time (Face Mob)
What else? (we keep you)
Now motherfuckers lay it down
The ruler's back, cause it's too many pussies out here
Making bullshit records and ruining rap
I gotta check this whole game; niggas out here listening
To these record label bitches instead of doing they thing
I'm a real nigga, a street nigga till it's done with
And I could never let you talk me into dumb shit
Like selling out to move a few more units
Just keep me in the ghetto cause the hood stay truest
You fuck around and cross the other side of the track
Catch you a brick then realize that you can't come back
I'mma stick to the facts
Fuck it if I don't go two
The homies know that Face stay true
And though I've got more muscle, my sounds don't change
Been the same ever since I stepped in the game
Now, this is for these niggas switchin' they shit
Prostituting theyself, trying to get them a hit
Suck a dick"
Eminem	15	Legacy	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 2]	"I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
‘Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin'
‘Cause I obsess on everything in my mind, small shit
Bothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara
Then split, but I don’t give a shit
I'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman
Nothing is the matter with me
Shit, look on the bright side, at least I ain't walkin'
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that
I find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even tryin' to put up a fight? It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'?
They are kind of giving me confidence
Instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eye-balled him
Grab hold of my balls, like, ""That's right, fight's on, bitch!""
Who woulda knew, from the moment I turned the mic on, that
I could be iconic in my conquest?
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest"
2Pac	18	Death Around the Corner	Me Against The World	1995	[Outro]	"This is for all the real motherfuckin' niggas out there
I know you ain't scared to die; we all gotta go, y'know?
A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes
And make sure he handles his motherfuckin' business
(You think you're gonna live long enough to spend that money, you fuckin' hump?)
Y'all niggas stop actin' like pussies out there, all right?
If any of you...
Are tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like that...
I want his family dead! I want his house burnt to the ground!
I wanna go there in the middle of the night, I wanna piss on his ashes!
I want his family dead! I want his house burnt to the ground!
I wanna go there in the middle of the night, I wanna piss on his ashes!
I want that son of a bitch dead, I want him dead!
I want him dead, I don't care..."

Fake titties are implanted, fake lips, that's life destruction

See, I can let it speak for itself
But every now and then, it need a little help
Guess who? To the rescue, pump
Ripping up comp, I step and then stomp
A small scam it's in the land like Mr. Timberland
Prepare the stage for Rakim to stand
Then I pick a song, grab the mic, click it on
Time to get it on, kick along
See if you can move to the words I speak
Pick up on a rhythm (hit 'em with the beat)
My mental-ect gets warm, feed into your physical form
You can't keep calm
Get fit to the skit, try to hop on
Get hip to the trick as I flip the script
You're feelin' rust like a thrust of an arrow, plus
You're lookin' through the eye of a barrel, bust
Emergency, take him to the operatin' room
Put him on the floor, let his heart feel the boom
React to the wrath of a brand new song
Then kick along"

But just remember, all dogs got days
And even while you wait to exhale, you all pay
So women, stop complainin' 'bout your men
Be glad they got a nine to a five and not a ten
In the state pen', sendin' pictures off, gettin' skinny
Claimin' they ain't takin' no dick while you face plenty

Family tradition when I'm randomly spittin'
And girls love my voice, they say it's handsomely different
I never won awards, no Grammys and things
Back in the days did sticks, made niggas hand me they rings
What goes around comes around, they tried me later
But I survived all the thugged out, grimey capers
My concepts caused more panic than bomb threats
Don't take me for granted because I'm calm and shit

Eminem	15	So Much Better	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 2]	"Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway tryna get some time alone and just think
'Til the cops pulled me over, but they let me go, 'cause I told 'em
I'm only drivin' drunk 'cause that bitch drove me to drink
I'm back on my fuck hoes, with a whole new hatred for blondes
But bias? I hate all bitches the same, baby, come on!
Excuse the pun, but bitch is such a broad statement, and I'm
Channelin' my anger through every single station that's on!
'Cause a woman broke my he-art, I say, ""he-art""
'Cause she ripped it in two pa-arts and threw it in the garbage
Who do you think you a-are? Bitch, guess it's time for me to get the dust off
And pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the L-word again
I lo-lo-lo-lo… lesbian!
Aaahhh! I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest, my life'd be so much better if you just—"
Snoop Dogg	0	Who Am I (What’s My Name)?	Doggystyle	1993	[Verse 1]	"From the depths of the sea, back to the block
Snoop Doggy Dogg, funky as the, the, The D.O.C. 
Went solo on that ass, but it's still the same
Long Beach is the spot where I serve my 'caine
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, but don't lose your grip
Nine-trizzay's the yizzear for me to fuck up shit
So I ain't holdin nothin' back
And motherfucker, I got five on a twenty sack
It's like that and as a matter of fact
'Cause I never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

And a mission ain't a mission if nobody dies

Enemies rest in peace, deceased fuckin' with me (Niggas is wild)
I gotta accomplish the goal, I'm out seekin' gold
Dispose the strap, gotta let off because I'm rough and raw
Never fell to my knees for shit, 'cause I demand shit
With Diz-Daz Dillinger drillin' you for your shit
On the streets for the sixth time, in and out for the crime
My ranked crimes add up in food stamp, dollars, and dimes
I'm slippin', slidin', fucked up, nigga, what up?
In the cut, flossin' like a motherfucker, what up?
Beside LB, now tell me where you comin' from?
That ain't where I see thangs, and nigga, what's the outcome?"

We scream: ""Rocks, blow, weed, park,"" see, now we smart
We ain't retards the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now, tell my mama I belong in that slow class
It's bad enough we on welfare
You tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chromey wheels here
You tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes, I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say, my niggas—"
Kendrick Lamar	16	DUCKWORTH.	DAMN.	2017	[Verse]	"Oh, Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny ma'fucker
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
Ten-thousand dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mill' twenty years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters, caught a murder case
Fingerprints on the gun they assumin', but witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing
They say 5-0 came, circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
His name was Ducky, he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really at gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime
Intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
Anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him
In fact, it look like they're the last to survive, pay attention
That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight
*Gunshot*"

You don't love me, you just pretendin'
I need a happy beginnin', middle and endin'

It's gettin' hot in here, that's all that I know
Got a hotel room, three stars for you
You call down for an omelet, girl, it's 5 in the morning
You realize we at the DoubleTree, not the Aria
Only thing open is Waffle House, girl, don't start with me
I used the Western Union for you like it's no prob'

You think the Marriott is livin' in a skyscraper
Till you come across some even more flyer paper

Terry-cloth robes, elegance, movie shit
Heated-up marble floors with jacuzzis in it
First-class flights, diamonds in your crucifixes
All those things, you still ain't really doing shit, kid
‘Cause in reality, I'll earn my salary
The way I flaunted it then would now embarrass me
It kinda make me wanna hate bling
It's a race thing how they sell blacks the bootleg shit
In fact, real millionaires spend 60 mil on paintings
Whores charge niggas with raping
‘Cause we come out doors of Maybach cars
Watch us make bets on race tracks, smokin' cigars
So they counter the laws to take what's ours
'Bout 500K on a lawyer to beat the charge
So you can't stop us from making a billion dollars
Instead of going back, I'm buying the projects
But I'm not going back

And regardless, I know my nigga still proud
It's been a while since we spoke but you still my folks

A city filled with hate, more deaths accumulate
Drug wars daily, a lot of blood spilled
Kids on the playground shot down and killed
Nobody wants to live on the first floor no more
'Cause stray bullets explore
We're killing ourselves off slowly but surely
And at the end of the year, I'm sure many more'll be
Rubbed out in a quest for clout
The rest'll be drugged out, this is bugged out
Half of the projects is dead or locked up
Kids getting kidnapped and then found chopped up
Human abortion create distortions
And that's just a portion, you know that we're lost when
Babies are addicted to drugs when they are born

Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money

My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic

I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty

But since when did this many people ever give a shit
What I had to say? It's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm livin', put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric
I thanked you for it, for drawin' more attention toward it
‘Cause it gave me an enormous platform
I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
And battled for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
Atta-boy, they told me to slow down, I'd just zone out
Good luck tryin' to convince a blonde

To make way for these new names and faces
But the strangest things can happen from rappin'
When niggas get wrapped up in image and actin'
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags, when it happens, that's it
I've seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Watched 'em rise, witnessed it, and watched 'em blow
Watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
Best friends and money? I lost 'em both
Went and visited niggas in the hospital
It's all the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show"

Life is a sine wave, Einstein mind in this time-space
When they try to keep, you gotta climb gates
Escape from a city that's defined by crime rate
Design traits that minimize the grind
Then divide on your mind's states
Find breaks, gaps to recline safe
Resign a sign and rewind tapes
Get your line straight, recite it all right
Even if you gotta do it in nine takes
Be centered, remember where the mind's placed
How many more runners can the shrines take?
The ground don't know how the wine taste
When do niggas know to stop buying cakes? Yeah"

Now let me talk to ya, girl"
Kanye West	5	The Food (Live)	Be	2004	[Chorus]	"I walked in the crib, got two kids
And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
So I had to did, what I had to did
Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
I'm up all night, getting my money right
Until the blue and white (po-po! po-po! po-po!)
Now the money coming slow, but a least a - know
Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)"
André 3000	27	Aquemini	Aquemini	1998	[Verse 4]	"My mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten
Meet the twin, André Ben', welcome to the lion's den
Original skin, many men comprehend
I extend myself, so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it—that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in with your kin
Look again, 'cause I swear, I spot one every now and then
It's happening again, wish I could tell you when
""André, this is André, y'all are just gon' have to make amends"""
Travis Scott	33	SICKO MODE	ASTROWORLD	2018	[Verse 1]	"(Woo) Made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose"
Kurupt	4	I Don’t Like to Dream About Gettin’ Paid	Dogg Food	1995	[Verse 3]	"Damn, I can't believe this
But you can best believe this day
I'm on another mission to get paid
Serve what I can serve, right? (Right)
So my pockets will stack up
Nigga, don't trip, nigga, back up (Hold up!)
I gots to react off the first impulse I find
But my mama thinks I should take my time, and work for mines
But how much work would it take?
And how much money would I make?
Wait! There's somethin' I gotta think about
But I ain't got that much time, moms want a nigga out tha house
I ain't gettin' no younger, I'm only gettin' older
I'm only, thinkin' 'bout what my mama told me
Now, I'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta 4 life
And the fact that I'm out to get paid twice — I ain't nuttin' nice!
Down to slang or pull a heist
Jakk, or break muthafuckaz on the dice
That's real, now what should I do? Just chill
When it's time to peel caps and adapt to kill?
I'm concealed, unconcealed
So I maintain fo' the salary
And my mentally is raw from the do'
I go hard from the do', up against all odds
Always down to squab, Dogg Pound 4 life
I survived 'til '95, day after day
Makin' hits wit' D-A-Z to get paid, nigga, yeah!"
JAY-Z	6	Legacy	4:44	2017	[Interlude]	"I remember, like, listenin' to Wu-Tang

Kanye West	5	Homecoming	Graduation	2007	[Verse 2]	"But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes, I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town"
Rakim	10	When I B on tha Mic	The Master	1999	[Verse 1]	"It's to my real ill niggas, heavyweight hitters
Dough-getters, fifty ways to make figures
My niggas that come on the spot to feel sisters
Like they hear real spitters and kids on the zigga-ziggas
When it's ugly, then the club is lovely
Thugs be sippin' Hennessy and bubbly
To my comrades that keep it flamin' hot
On dangerous blocks, claimin' spots
Where the goal is to be one of the top-ranked soldiers
Forty-five holders, one of the high rollers
Get respect in the hood, credit is good
Knock it down lumberjack style, baby; extra wood
Rock it all night long, the bang-a-thon
Baby, keep hangin' on, we like it with the lights on
Don't have to blow twenty thou' to get to know honey's style
Show her the town, steal her heart, no money down!"
Kendrick Lamar	16	i (Album Version)	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Outro]	"I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase ""fuck nigga""
He said, ""Think about what you saying: 'Fuck niggas'
No better than Samuel on the Django
No better than a white man with slave boats""
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hole us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait, listen
N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlooked the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more
Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time
Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive"

Take money, take money-money-money"

All night we ducking them buck shots
We hear pop-pop! Nigga hop-pop!

Ride with the eyes of five blind men, my vision (Corrupted)
Mama tried counseling, five plans for Kendrick (But fuck it)
My family ties had sabotaged Rosecrans existence (Abducted)
My aliens on surveillance, they paid me a visit (Disgusting)
Our stadium's packed, Raiders in black
Curls dripping, silver bullet, palladium in my strap
I lie on the side of a one-way street (Blow-blow-blow-blow!)
Nowhere to go, death all I can see (Blow-blow-blow-blow!)
I say ""Fuck is up?"" I fuck 'em up
Your supper's up, and something's up
I hope he no can walk the tightest rope before the double-dutch
Broke plenty records with this weapon, I protect it under oath

Fuck your mama. fuck your daddy, fuck your dead homie
Fucked the world up when we came up, that's Compton, homie!"

Fuck the police, they hop out and bust doors
I ain't goin' back to jail, nigga that's what I flush for
My money or my Glock, who do I trust more?
I don't know, it's probably the one that I touch more
Guess it's the green, cause paper motivate niggas
And my Rolex racist cause it hate niggas
I used to only sell 8's like that Laker nigga
Now I'm movin' 24's like I play at the Staples Center

Am I in the way?

I want your blessing today
Oh, by the way, open the door by the way
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm on the way, I know connection is vague
Pick up the phone for me, babe
Damn it, we jammin'
Bad attitude from yo' nanny
Curves and your hips from yo' mammy
Remember Gardena, I took the studio Camry
I know Top will be mad at me
I had to do it, I want your body, your music
I bought the big one to prove it
Look what you made
Told you that I'm on the way
I'm like a exit away, yep"
Eminem	15	Medicine Man	Compton	2015	[Verse 2]	"In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem I was this good scoffed, I just shook off
Prob'ly reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
But based on how I ascended
See how plain it was now, they want me to jet
But no one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'til I took off
Mistook me because I looked soft
But I stood tall, I just followed the 
So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off
Decided opposing you is what I'm ‘posed to do, all's
I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fuckin' goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karma's headed for Armageddon
The drama setter, I'm going in, already got an arm and head in
Whoever said words are just words ain't heard me word 'em
I give a fuck if my image even ends up taking a personal hit
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned in this bitch
And whatever bitches feel like they didn't deserve what they get
And whatever consequences come with every verse
It's worth it, so Doc, turn the beat on
Whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
And here's to all the years I spent toein' a line to overtime
As sure as a mole is blind
In my mind I'm still underground as a groundhog
And I'ma go for mine, like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
No signs of slowin', these lines are my 9's
I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
All I needed was someone to co-sign
Been a  assault rifle
With the sniper scope for this whole time
Day one, say when to blast, just give me the order, I spray (Uh)
Pain in the ass, you'll get shot in the ass with a paint gun
Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none
I even make the bitches I rape cum
I'm waitin' on someone to say somethin'
Dre, make the bass pump!
And let the tape run for old time's sake!
I spit it straight through, this is take one
The moment you're waitin' for has come, but the—"
Nas	9	Every Ghetto	Stillmatic	2001	[Verse 1]	"Uh, yeah, uh
Blessings of life to the children, they say life is like five days
Words of a old man with silver hair, in his wheelchair
His eyes were bloody while describin' what lies before me
Said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me
It occurred to me, this old nigga's words couldn't be realer
I'm on top now, slightest drama, I'll have to kill ya
'Cause animals sense weakness, sharks smell blood in water
Ishmael, Moses and Job knew the divine order
Shit is plastic material, havin' no life
I crash whips and leave it no matter the price
As long as I survive, cop a new five
Circle the block where the beef's at
And park in front of my enemy's eyes
They see that it's war, we life stealers, hollow-tip lead busters
There's no Heaven or Hell, dead is dead, fuckers
And your soul is with God, your mind keeps lurkin' the earth
Watchin' your own murder reoccur"

It gives me energy, so I'ma keep fiends
Coming just to get what I'm selling

On your team I'll pull the curtain, a beautiful hurtin'

Niggas never learnin', let they eyes keep lurkin'
Have ya janitor pumpin' your X5 murkin'
Skid marks the street, heart skips a beat
Beef? Nigga, overcook that meat!
Get no sleep, only rest is in between the blink
My life story was written in blood, permanent ink
Killer instinct, R.I.P. 'em
Gotta think like that 'cause forever I be needin' 'em
Plan flawless, mistakes never repeatin' 'em
Some love me, some hate me, bitches in the head beatin' 'em

Since the last ""Just Don't Bite It"" girls don't know how to act
Sayin' that they never would suck a dick
But when they've tried it they couldn't quit
'Cause ninety percent of the bitches today, they love that shit
And those are the main ones that say they don't do it
But MC Ren knows the bitches are used to it
So fellas, next time they try to tell a lie
That they never sucked a dick, punch the bitch in the eye
And then the ho will fall to the ground, then you'll open up her mouth
Put your dick in and move the shit around
And she'll catch on and start doin' it on her own
Actin' like she's tryin' to suck the meat off a chicken bone
And then she won't let go
Because bitches suck nut out of a dick just like Drano
Get the last drop, unclogging the pipe
Then the stupid bitch is out doing the same shit the next night
Because she just can't quit
'Cause she's addicted, addicted
She's addicted, addicted
She's addicted to suck a good dick"

That's cause I'm in Europe, me in my French tour-a
I'm on my pimp, my temperature is tempura
I take it easy on my watch, I'm watching TV
In my cleanest Maharashi, see the hare is tryna beat me
I continue to do Lu's pace
They say him got two heads and four eyes just like screwface
But see my secret's safe, it's in my secret safe

Oh no, not another new jack, swearin' that he's ruthless
Ducked and now he's fucked and left toothless
I can hear the fear in your flow, you ain't prepared
You're scared and you're bound to go
It's somethin', I guess I let the beat keep bumpin'
Stop trippin' off these niggas 'cause they ain't about nuttin'
Or should I say naythin'
Punk put my tape in, fuck all the fake-in
I'm sick of the bullshit
Come equipped and get ready to rip
Or get the dick of the lunatic"

Future	30	I Serve the Base	DS2	2015	[Verse 3]	"They should've told you I was just a trap nigga
I'm in the white house shootin' craps niggas
I gave up on my conscience, gotta live with it
This remind me when I had nightmares
These bitches wanna be here, they'll be right here
They should've told you I was just a trap, nigga
They should've told you I was gon' lap niggas
They should've told you I was overseas
Say his last words, he can't breathe
They sent the ghetto bird out to peep me
They finally did admit that I was cloned
Because I was ambitious, now I'm on
Five in the mornin' on the corner rollin' stones
I just brought the money, I'll count it on my own

I think niggas is tryna kill me
Picturin' pistols spittin' hollow-points 'til they drill me
Keepin' it real, and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts preoccupied wit' keepin' steel
See, niggas is false, sittin' in court, turned snitches
They used to be real, but now they petrified bitches
I'm tryna be strong, they sendin' armies out to bomb me
Listen to Ron, the only DJ that can calm me
Constantly armed, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm, and fuck the world 'til I'm gone
Bitches be warned: word is bond, you'll get torn
I'm bustin' on Giuliani, he rubbin' my niggas wrong
And then it's on, before I leave picture me
I'm spittin' at punk bitches and hustlin' to be free
Watch me set it
Niggas don't want it, you can get it, bet it
Make these jealous niggas mad, I said it
This Thug Life, nigga, we don't cater to you hoes

Only on the TV when I blow kisses at him, muah

If it ain't about snatch, well it just won't happen!
Hov ain't into backwards mackin
How backwards that is
I don't love 'em though
'Less makin a little paper then I love 'em the most
If she's, sneakin in the club with the toast

Talk about some paper if you tryin to book me

Concealin them slugs, if it go down, remember that mug
Cause ain't no love when a nigga shit is touchin' his ribs
Hungrier than a hostage, shit, we blitz
In formation pack the lead up in shit
The better you get, the better we get, and that's it
Yo this snake's in the grass when they bite Mobb anti-venom
Stop 'em in they tracks, goin at 'em when you send 'em
Imperial dogs, creepin' through fog
Carved needle slip and you fold, the shit's lethal
We roll Mobb D-iezel, the whole Q.U. double-E, N-S
And when you spot us, play low-key"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst	good kid, m.A.A.d city	2012	[Verse 3]	"Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin' that's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told""
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs, and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?"
Eminem	15	’Till I Collapse	The Eminem Show	2002	[Verse 3]	"Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so"
Dr. Dre	1	Something Like That	Straight Outta Compton	1988	[Verse 1]	"Back by demand, now it's big as fuck
Because you as the public, you should know what's up
""Compton's in the House"" was more than gold, it was a hit
Cause it was based on some crazy shit
So our final conclusion has been permitted
Punks made us a target and knew that we'd hit it
But that was a part of showbiz
Hey yo, homeboy, why don't you tell 'em what your name is"
Nas	9	Got Ur Self a Gun	Stillmatic	2001	[Chorus]	"I got mine, I hope you

MC Ren	17	Quiet On Tha Set	Straight Outta Compton	1988	[Verse 2]	"Now to get started with my musical profession
A gangsta or villain in mine is in session
The way that I'm referrin' to this makes ya move ya butt
But don't stand in a daze, yeah you should know what's up
Anyway I keep 'em clappin' along
'Cause nothing bad could go wrong because this song is so strong
I'm like Toyota, who could ask for anything more
When N.W.A. is cold rockin' the floor
Like stupid, actin like a retard
Waitin' for a bumrush, gettin' to the good part
It tempts me so with temptation
Writin' my lyrics with this hyped information
This is a section of my creation
So don't say shhh! with an explanation
Just look at the center of the stage where the spotlight shines
(Boy you should have known by now) It's mine!
Unpredictable, keepin you extremely enjoyed
It's irresistible, meaning that you can't avoid
And while I'm on stage, look forward to sweat
But after I rip it up I want quiet on tha' set

I know these dirty cops that'll get us in if we murder some wop
Hop in your Hummer, the Punisher's ready
Meet me at Vito's with Noodles
We'll do this dude while he's slurpin' spaghetti

André 3000	27	Aquemini	Aquemini	1998	[Verse 2]	"Twice upon a time, there was a boy who died
Lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter
Live from ""home of the brave,"" with dirty dollars
Beauty parlors, baby ballers, bowling-ball Impalas
Street scholars, majoring in culinary arts—
You know, how to work bread, cheese, and dough from scratch
But, see, the catch is you can get caught
Know what you selling, what you bought, so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge—meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walking slowly to the candy lady
It's looking bad—
Need some hope like the words ""maybe,"" ""if,"" or ""probably""
More than a hobby
When my turntables get wobbly, they don't fall
I'm sorry, y'all, I often drift—I'm talking gift
So when it comes, you never look the horse inside its grill
Of course, you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it, but it's needed, so what have you?
Now, question: Is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall?
Naww, so don't get caught up in appearance
It's OutKast, ""Aquemini"": another Black experience"
Eminem	15	Unaccommodating	Music to Be Murdered By	2020	[Chorus]	"They call me Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini

Eminem	15	Rap God	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 3]	"So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?"
André 3000	27	I’ll Call B4 I Cum	Stankonia	2000	[Chorus]	"I'll call before I come

No, after you"
Rakim	10	R.A.K.I.M.	8 Mile	2002	[Verse 3]	"Ay yo, we toast to that, it's the cat that broke backs
To a soul clap, a smoke a track, how dope is that
Poet for rap, wrote backs that most slack
That know rap before they turned coke to crack
To my dogs hearin' sirens on and firearms
Outcome die in wars or behind iron bars
The boulevard, tire frauds when I evolve
Try and rob, my dialogue, I am God
Chicks moan just to get next to my throne
And sniff my cologne and get Ra alone
Sex spot's at home, I'm testosterone
Caress spots, stress drops, bedrock's the bone
Hit the floor, it's hot for 2003
Hit's galore, who rock a style as wild as me
Rest assure, when I rock dance crowds and scream
Bismillah Ir-Rahman Ir-Rahim it's the"
Eminem	15	Never Love Again	Music to Be Murdered By	2020	[Verse 2]	"Some days it feels like you're all that I have
That's why I'm tryna hold onto you for as long as I can
And you just want me for my money so I got you wrapped all in saran
Damn, talk about eatin' out the palm of my hand
But if not for my financials
I wouldn't have you anyways, there have been ample
Plenty days, where I'm just in a daze and I can't pull
Myself up out this rut and you're so much of a handful
I can only take so much of you all at one time
Because too much of you's just too much to swallow sometimes
Gotta take you in doses, but when you're not at my side
I shake in convulsions, separation anxiety 'cause we may be the closest
Yeah, baby, we hopeless, don't we make an atrocious
Combination? We know, it's like playin' with explosives
Quite dangerous though, but my brain's in hypnosis
Such a wide range of emotions
Migraines, but why the fuck am I takin' these MOTRINs?
Ibuprofens, like a drop of rain in the ocean
And you're my fix on the days when I'm broken
But the shit's about to go sideways, I just know it"

No, until we meet again, hold ya head and stay strong (Yeah)
Yo, got my mind on a place to hide from police (Where?)
Sweatin' dogs as I'm runnin' 'cross 12th Street

And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold that say ""Queen""
You love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
You love French tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself?"

Sub woofers in the trunk kickin' that ""Lethal Injection""
A hood nigga lost with no direction
So he bought a black Smith & Wesson
Strapped on his vest and that's his protection
At the intersection waitin' on the rival
Cause in the city of Angels, it's all about survival
Fuck the 5-0, They wanna see you DOA

Descendent of the kings and queens, the overseer
The overlord, cream of the crop, crème de la crème
Spent years building with cats in the streets so they my men
Again, Gang Starr has done it
Remember too much jewels back in the days? You'd have to run it
Check it, the ground be hot under our feet
So we be listenin' to beats to keep the cypher complete
Whether you kids be holdin' on the block all day
Or you be puffin' lye out in the back hallway
Or whether you be in school or in the library

Kanye West	5	Everything I Am	Graduation	2007	[Verse 3]	"I know people wouldn't usually rap this
But I got the facts to back this
Just last year, Chicago had over six hundred caskets
Man, killing's some wack shit
Oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
Do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
The church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
Pink slip on my door, 'cause I can't afford to stay
My fifteen seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough, Mr. West, please, no more today"
Prodigy	8	Q.U.—Hectic	The Infamous	1995	[Verse 1]	"I open my eyes to the streets where I was raised as a man
And learned to use my hands for protection in scuffles
Throwin' my blows in doubles
I'm comin' from Queens, motherfucker, carryin' guns in couples
And wildin', a Q-U soldier
From Lefrak to Rockaway, back to Queensbridge, black
It's only crack sales makin' niggas act like that
Back in the days we would scrap, now you lay on your back
As things changed with time, I traded in my knuckles for a Mac-10
And rather live the life of crime
With my Bed-Stuy connection connectin' in two
It's liable to start shit too wild for you
Peace to, Baisley, Forty-P get down
And when you outta town, represent your ground
Them niggas bleed just like us, so show 'em where we come from
Queens; leavin' niggas done, son"

(Com, say it)
Get your third eye poked
Fuck game, I assemble dope
Ness, a nigga that's fresh as the fest
Studied this rap shit, no need to mic test
You can feel it in your chest
Your bia' feel it in her breasts
Plus you, rhyme like a nigga wit his nipples pierced
We lick off lyrics in the streets and real niggas hear us
Dreamin when I wrote this, box me if I go too wild
Still doin this shit like dude in Wild Style
Inviting wack niggas to dinner
I Trick Daddy emcees and I don't know, nann nigga
Who can take it where I take it
You better goin' to God like Ma$e did
Leaving crowds complacent
I move 'em above clouds whether on some surf and turf shit
Or thug style you can feel it in your body
Yeah y'all you can feel it in your body"
Kanye West	5	Celebration	Late Registration	2005	[Chorus]	"Yeah, you know what this is

Eminem	15	So Far...	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 1]	"This always happens
Thirty minutes from home, gotta lay a log cabin
Only option I have's McDonalds's bathroom
In a public stall, droppin' a football
So every time someone walks in the john, I get maddened
""Shady, what up?"" What? Come on, man, I'm crappin'
And you're askin' for my goddamn autograph on a napkin?
Oh, that's odd, I just happened to run out of tissue
Yeah, hand me that, on second thought I'd be glad then
""Thanks, dawg! Name's Todd, a big fan""
I wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up in a wad and threw it back and
Told him: ""Todd, you're the shit,"" when's all of this crap end?
Can't pump my gas without causin' an accident
Pump my gas, cut my grass, I can't take out the fuckin' trash
Without someone passin' through my sub, harassin'
I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math
I'd rather wallow than bask sufferin' succotash
But the ant-acid, it gives my stomach gas
When I mix my corn with my fuckin' mashed
Potatoes, so what? Ho, kiss my country bumpkin ass
Missouri Southern roots, what the fuck is upper class?
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper
Tupperware in the cupboard, plasticware up the ass
Stuck in the past—iPod, what the fuck is that?
B-Boy to the core, mule, I'm a stubborn ass"

Walk with a little nine, case I get in a bind
They say I'm fucking crazy, they think I'm out my mind
Cause I'm down to bust a nigga head all the time
Now you know the hoes, they know how I roll
In that new Rolls with the suicide doors
22 inch chrome, a nigga money long
You try to touch me, I pull out, you get your brains blown
You go against the grain, pussy and you on your own
You're entering in my zone, welcome to the terrordome
The ice blowing my chain, blood blue in my veins
Blue still in the range, I'm doing my thang
The semi-auto spray, run if you get away
We'll find your whereabouts and clap at you another day
Nigga play with the bread, get a hole in ya head
You touch a dime of mine thug and your ass dead"
Nas	9	Hip Hop Is Dead	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Verse 2]	"The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
Come through, something ill, missing the ceilin'
What influenced my raps? Stick-ups and killings
Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings
Criticize that, why's that?
‘Cause Nas rap is compared to legitimized crack
‘Cause we love to talk on nasty chickens
Most intellectuals will only half listen
So you can't blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
Oh, I think they like me, in my white tee
You can't ice me, we here for life, B
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that, we not taking it lightly
If hip hop should die, we die together
Bodies in the morgue lie together, all together now"

Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch some TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P"

Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I've been with ten women who got HIV
Now, don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me?
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably wanna grow up to be just like me"

Your titties, let 'em out, free at last
Thank God almighty, they free at last
We was up at the party but we was leavin' fast
Had to stop at 7-Eleven like I needed gas
I'm lyin', I needed condoms, don't look through the glass

Get you super wet after we turn the shower off"

Check it, a-one-two, a-one

Went from ""Player's Ball"" to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say, ""Motherfuck that playin',"" they payin', we stayin', layin' vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry

2Pac	18	Dear Mama	Me Against The World	1995	[Verse 1]	"When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home
I was a fool, with the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman, it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated"

Have you ever seen a crackhead? That's eternal fire
Why you got these kids' minds thinkin' that they evil?
While the preacher bein' freaky, you say, ""Honor God's people""
Should we cry when the Pope die? My request:
We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X
Mama, tell me: Am I wrong? Is God just another cop
Waitin' to beat my ass if I don't go pop?
Memories of a past time, givin' up cash to the leaders
Knowin' damn well they ain't gonna feed us
In my brain, how can you explain time in B.C.?
It's hard enough to live, now, in these times of greed
They say Jesus is a kind man
Well, he should understand times in this crime land
My thug nation, do what you gotta do but know you gotta change
Try to find a way to make it out the game
I leave this and hope God can see my heart is pure
Is Heaven just another door? I leave this here
I leave this and hope God see my heart is pure
Is Heaven just another door? And my people say"

Now I'ma touch on reality, chumps can't fuck with me
And all the honeys be loving me

Ill kid ready to wreck mics pronto
And I know I'll break your back with my rap like ""smack""

With stupid lyrics relative to a bloodbath

Perfect definition what a wife is, I like this
Showed me how excitin' life is
I used to hang around dudes that use ice picks
The sheistiest, put you on they heist list
How we met must've been fate
First date — crushed grapes, we ate lobster and steak
She kept askin' questions how the cash made, how my rent's paid
How many guns I sprayed, and huns I laid
She said she want to have a family raised, kids someday
Like out in Beverly Hills she wanna live one day
I can get with that
I drop you off home, I call, you hit me back
I wanna dig that, and did I? I did that
Put it way up where her ribs at, her future kids at
You held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats
You precious, more precious than lost treasure
Matter of fact, I'm kinda hopin' we can stay together, word"

Properly greet you with ice on your wrist
Wrist get sprained without all the pain
'Bout that time to get laced, get draped
'Bout that time to get some bezels, big face
Can't let you forget I got more hits than Elvis
I got your bitch tryna eat my pelvis
I'm on that level, your bitch feed me grapes
Man, she cooking my breakfast, she doing my nails
Ran through that pussy in some high-top Chanel
No NFL, but I'm one of the players
Took her to the hills in Manolo heels
She caught a balance and I paid the bill
I'm having stamina, let's keep it real (Yeah)
Three on a one, having sex on a pill (Yeah)
Count so much money, got buns on my hands
Living my life and it's bringing me chills
Tell me where the mils, I'm coming in the Lear

I'm on hydroponic nigga, full of bars and that red
I'm in camouflage and I fell in love with this bread
I don't ordinary no type of nigga, I don't beg
I bet I keep that tool on me everywhere
Spent a couple mill on my bitch last year
I just put a new whip on the E-way
Then I ran my bands back up like a relay

I just pop the tag on the Benz, it was Monday
I just keep that bag on me now, at least 100

It started out a robbery, they blew half his face off
They seen him shinin', cross full of diamonds he bought grindin'
His foot slip off the ladder of success he was climbin'
The D's came through, askin' niggas if they know what happened
Somehow my name end up in anythin' that involves clappin'
Detectives at my mama crib, they say they wanna question me
They put me in a lineup last time and they arrested me
When it come to cookin' coke, they know I got the recipe
I turn a quarter to a half, that's why they mess with me
I'm the neighborhood pusher, I move packs to make stacks
A little weed, a little X, a little H, little crack
Figure, I'll push it to the limit, take the shit to the max
Navy blue vest on, navy blue Yankee hat
Calm, in my palm's fully loaded firearm
First to let off last to run, every time it's on"

Grippin' you up, fuckin' and chokin' you
What the hell was I supposed to do?
I know you ain't gettin' this type of dick from that local dude
And if you are, I hope you have a good time
'Cause I definitely be havin' mine
And you ain't finna see a mogul get emotional
Every time I hear about other niggas is strokin' you
Lie and say I hit you, he sittin' there consoling you
Runnin' my name through the mud, who's provoking you?
You should be grateful a nigga like me ever noticed you
Now you noticeable and can't nobody get control of you
1 a.m. and can't nobody get a hold of you
I'm callin' your brother's phone, like, what was I supposed to do?
Even though I knew he never told the truth
He was just gon' say whatever that you told him to
At a certain point, I had to stop asking questions
Y'all got dirt on each other like mud wrestlers
I heard he bought some coke with my money, that ain't right, girl
You gettin' blackmailed for that white girl
You always said, ""Yeezy, I ain't your right girl
You'll probably find one of them 'I like art'-type girls""
""All of the lights,"" she was caught in the hype, girl
And I was satisfied bein' in love with a lie
Now who to blame? You to blame?
Me to blame? For the pain
And it poured every time when it rained"

Kendrick Lamar	16	The Blacker the Berry	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 3]	"I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this, if you listen, then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm Black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET 'cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!"
Eminem	15	White America	The Eminem Show	2002	[Verse 3]	"See, the problem is, I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise would've never knew these words exist
Whose moms probably would've never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your livin' rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin' with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waitin' to choke, tightenin' around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this, like, ""I don't like this note!""
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors workin' 'round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin' to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say ""faggot,"" shit

The poster child, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for—"

(Where you disappear to, son?) Maintaining
Putting myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in, I'm living
The Ill Street Blues got you hunger paining
Nothing to gain and a whole lot to lose, you still singing, fool
I'm thorough in every borough, my name be ringing
Warming it up for the perfect time to hit your brain, and
You feelin' it? To all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal my bricks
No doubt, they can vouch my life is real as shit
'95 South and Papi on the Hill and shit
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed with shit
And all the thorough-ass niggas that I hustle with
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit
These fake rappers can't really know I'm loving it, you feeling it?"
Snoop Dogg	0	Nuthin’ but a “G” Thang	The Chronic	1992	[Verse 1]	"One, two, three and to the four
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance so back on up
Give me the microphone first, so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
Ain't nothin' but a ""G"" thang, baby
Two loced out niggas goin' crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this
But, um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch, I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earnin' her man and learnin' her man
And at the same time burnin' her man
Now, you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff"
Kendrick Lamar	16	For Sale? (Interlude)	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 1]	"I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
You looked me in my eyes about four, five times

Roses are red, violets are blue

Jay-Z	12	Threat	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 2]	"Grown man, I put hands on you
I dig a hole in the desert, then build the Sands on you

We Rat Pack niggas, let Sam tap dance on you
Then I Sinatra, shot ya, goddamn you
I put the boy in the box like David Blaine
Let the audience watch, it ain't a thang
Y'all wish I was frontin', I George Bush the button
For the oil in your car, lift up your hood, nigga run it
Then lift up your whole hood like you got oil under it
Your boy got the goods, y'all don't want nothin' of it
Like, castor oil, I'll Castor Troy you
Change your face or the bullets change all that for you
Y'all niggas is targets, y'all garages for bullets
Please don't make me park it in your upper level
Valet a couple strays from the .38 special, nigga, God bless you"
Kanye West	5	Hey Mama	Late Registration	2005	[Chorus]	"(Hey, Mama, ah, ow)

And you might lose your life for your jewels and ice
I'ma slide to the telly and abuse your wife
If I got one rubber, I'ma use it twice
I give young fools advice about the rules of heist
When I rock 'gators, hoes be like, ""Them shoes is nice""
Dimes I'm willin' to hit, I stay drillin' a chick
They all know I ain't shit, but they still on my dick
And I never walk the streets without the vest and the chrome
'Cause all my jewels be Rocky like Sylvester Stallone
I blast the TEC at your dome and leave you restin' alone
Go home and puff a fat bag of sess 'til I'm gone
You got this nigga frontin' like he the main event
When his album ain't even last long, it came and went
I'm like Gotti to him, I throw the shotty to him

Big Boi	26	Knowing	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse 1]	"Well, here's a formal introduction, something to make you ponder
The situation's ugly like In Living Color's Wanda (Word up)
Now, everybody play dumb, but there's some
That succumb or fall a victim
I will overcome any hurdle or obstacle that's in my path
Fast cash should be the last resort, so make it last
For the risk you took, trick, you shook your ass
For some hundred dollar heels and a designer bag
Now that's ass-backwards
All you got in the refrigerator is bratwurst
Your stomach is balled in a knot, you got that Phat purse
Pocketbook, stop and look, pockets look void
Destroyed by the need to indulge and enjoy the finer things in life (Yeah)
Your dignity the only sacrifice
Slim as your chances of being somebody's wife
They seeing you butt booty naked every night
Ain't nothing right or wrong"

Now, it's pay a player, pay a nigga, got a day-to-day to stack and still, I pay accountants
Twenty racks to show just a little allowance, only come to Houston if the boy allow it
Bow your head to a real one, comin' down with them main niggas
H-Town, don't play with us, them with-it boys stay with-with-with it
I been grindin', slavin' over time since I was a fan
Lookin' in the mirror like ""One day, Jacques, you gon' be the man""
One skinny, tatted nigga, blunt flicker, young La Flame, hot spitter who can't hold his liquor, yeah"
Eminem	15	8 Mile	8 Mile	2002	[Verse 1]	"Sometimes I just feel like quittin', I still might
Why do I put up this fight? Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up, I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been 'vict'd
So I must then get off the bus then split
Man, fuck this shit, yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road"

Ava Gardner, the crashin' of James Dean
Bobby Brown influenced by Rick James and it goes
Prince wanted Alexander O'Neal to be Morris Day or Jerome

Phyllis Hyman killed herself, it was crazy
Mommy was bad they say
Donny Hathaway free-fall from a balcony, he swayze"
Rakim	10	All Night Long	The Master	1999	[Chorus]	"So if you love to get your party on

The world brought me to my knees; ""What have you brung? You?
Did you improve on a design? Did you do something new?
Well, your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You—the more famous person—you come through
And the sexy lady next to you, come too!""
And then it hit me, standing outside of Heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me: I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung blue
""Go back, whatever you did, you undo.""
Heavy as Heaven, the Devil on me, two tons too
Ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha"

And cake mean his stock, net gross
Young kids step it up, go for the most
New cameras in police cars takin' pictures
New hustlas gettin' new street figures
And US embassies overseas
Almost every foreign country's under siege
Covertly startin' wars, CIA, NAVY Seals
Commit larcenies that be worth over mil's
Oil in the earth spills
Girls blow they body up, birth control pills
African's pick diamonds out a dark caves
Then we wear it on our necks just so we can light up the stage"

Y'all deserve the world, I wasn't worthy of no wedding ring
It ain't be one day since I met you I wasn't there for you
Wasn't husband material, but you know I really cared for you
And I know you remember that time when he was 5
All these tours taking the toll, I can see it in his eyes
So I stopped tours, stopped rapping, didn't give a fuck about
Nothing that happened after recording The Doctor's Advocate
Catching up with my son, cause ain't nothing more important
Than walking inside the Footlocker, copping them matching Jordans
Helping him with his jumper, the day he turned 9
I asked him what he want for his birthday, he said to spend some time
So we kick it, that's my best friend, I don't have to get married
He still my best man, and that's forever
Anybody can be a daddy, just bust a nut and leave

50K to cousins, post a caption
Pray none of my enemies hold me captive"
Gang Starr	21	My Advice 2 You	Moment of Truth	1998	[Chorus]	"You remember what happened last time, when you got knocked

While rich diplomats, are purchasin their next villas
But for the scrilla and power, uhh
They'll send some killers to their hood, that are iller than ours
Still niggas settle beef, with the metal piece
And every block stays hot, like the devil's feet
Incarceration of the mind, police brutality and poverty
These are realities of mankind
And we can't win nigga, if we keep shuckin and jivin

I'm a savage for your kiss
Embarrassed when I'm not with you, I'm off guard
Niggas always expect to see us two together, stable
The best couple they seen since Trump and Marla Maple
Don't need no pre-nup
'Cause when we hump we do it up
Make sure we both will bust a dollar sign nut
Before I got to know you, my life I say was mediocre
Break of day, slinging all night long, fiending to stroke ya
Seeing niggas with you I wasn't happy
Wanted to stick them up to get you, heard you calling for daddy
And gladly I take you as my lawfully wedded wife
Never divorce me, I promise to treat you right
Keep you satisfied, never lie, help you grow
My legal tender, lovely federal reserve note"

Just like a Rochester customer
God bless the mothers and younger brothers of hustlers
Cause she don't wan' sob at his wake
But he want to follow in his steps
Bang his hat, learn his shakes

Some shit just never make sense like bashin' the gays

(Outlaw! Outlaw! Outlaw!)
21-gun salute to my niggas that die in the line of duty
Representin' to the fullest, bein' soldiers with military minds
That play the rules of the game, 21-gun salute
I salute you, my niggas, stay strong
I ride for you, I rhyme for you, I roll for you, it's all for you
To all you bitch-made niggas, I'm comin' for you
Against all odds, I don't care who the fuck you is
You touch me, I'm at you
I know you motherfuckers didn't think I forgot
Hell nah, I ain't forgot, nigga
I just remember what you told me
You said don't go to war unless I got my money right
I got my money right nigga, now I want war"
Scarface	11	Someday	The Fix	2002	[Verse 2]	"It seems like every other Wednesday I'm attending a wake
But I don't question you, I know that's your way, okay
I know we living for the minute and there's a moment in time
We've got to leave here, 'cause that's your design
And nothing lasts forever, not even spirit, only your word
That's what I live by, 'cause that's what I heard
I wasn't there when you rose from the dead or you parted the sea
I never seen you, but still I believe
How you explain the moon, the sky, the stars and the rain
The sun and the sea, the earth without form facing the deep?
In darkness challenging the powers that be
It's impossible for scientists to make up the seeds, to make up the trees
So why we turn our backs on the truth?
It's Heaven or Hell, the point we seem to hide from the youth
And I was singing this morning, got touched by the spirit
So I wrote it down for the homies to hear it"
Future	30	Slimed In	WE DON’T TRUST YOU	2024	[Outro]	"Richer than a ho, she a bird bitch
Call her up now, she workin'
Pull up to the stu', she twerkin'

Steppin' on a nigga like doormat
All my shooters run a four flat
Wideboy skrrt through, Hellcat
Walk a nigga down for a tall stack"
Eminem	15	Never Love Again	Music to Be Murdered By	2020	[Verse 3]	"So I spiral downwardly 'cause I'm too cowardly to leave you
Head is clouded in a fallacy, but in reality
Somehow it seems like when I lay me down to sleep I'm counting sheep
You're bound to creep
'Cause every time I turn around, you keep runnin' out on me
You're my Xanax and my valium, I'm an addict, you're a downer
You're my habit, it's like I found you in the cabinet
But it's like I can't uncap it 'cause it's childproof
A scoundrel and fiend's how I feel around you
Awful, every time I lost you, felt like I had you in my pocket
Now I'm flippin' over the furniture, punchin' holes in the walls through
Everything that we've gone through
How many times you've fucked me
But the way it felt for me to be on top when I was on you
Swore my fealty, but word to G.O.D
I thought you loved me, bitch, you tried to kill me, I'm getting off you
Quit callin' for me, hard proof's how I respond to
The Ambien and Tylenols too
Fuck all you"

Did you ever think a pimp rock a microphone?
Like that there, boy, and will still stay street
Big things happen every time we meet
Like a track team, crack fiend dyin' to geek
OutKast bumpin' up and down the street
Slant back Cadillac, 'bout five niggas deep
75 MC's freestylin' to the beat
'Cause we get crunk, stay drunk, at the club
Shoulda bought an ounce, but you copped a dub
Shoulda held back, but you throwed a punch
'Posed to meet your girl but you packed a lunch
No D to the U to the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl, four-year—Jordan
Never turned my back on my kids, for them
Should've hit it, quit it, rag-top
Before you re-up, get a laptop
Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coal
Record number four, but we on a roll
Hold up, slow up, stop, ""Control""
Like Janet, Planet, Stankonia's on ya
Moving like Floyd, comin' straight to Florida
Lock all your windows, then block the corridors
Pullin' off my belt 'cause a whipping's in order
Like a three-piece fish 'fore I cut your daughter
Yo quiero Taco Bell, then I hit the border
Pitty-pat rappers tryna get to five
I'm a microphone fiend tryin' to stay alive
When you come to ATL, boy, you better not hide
'Cause the Dungeon Family gon' ride, ha-ha!"

We mobbed on the pave, got treated like slaves
Young niggas treated like slaves
This the moment I've been waiting for
This why I moved to Cali, stepped outside and got shaded for
Told momma, ""Bitch, get back in the door""
I've been comin' up and down, a nigga can't take no more
Kamikaze over commas
Benjamins, dividends stuffed in my jeans, I can't fit in
Poppin' pills since droppin' Ritalins

We used to gangbang, a lot of that done died down
Children of the hat tiltin' keepin' hope alive now
All with no high, I do it so fly
Banksy's attack helicopter with the bow tie
I love my city, really hope that God bless it
Have my mind moving faster than that hog in the hedges
Welcome all of y'all to my dark recesses
This is where I keep the bars like bathtub edges
My Ivories and my Doves, my Levers and my Zests
This takes half of your bubble bath to match the freshness
The belly of the beast, you know I'm from it
I wrap it in a towel, hit Gomer Pyle in the stomach
And I be on my green like Irish Spring
And I coast, fudge with it, get a mouth full of soap"

Yappin' about this crew you run wit'
Bankhead bouncin' to that dumb shit
So what mo' can you come wit'?
Well, we zippin' around the corner in that golden stankin' Lincoln

Just in case these youngsters tryin' to take it
Pullin' the pistol on another black man was never the plot

You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but, Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car, they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was, it was you
Damn"
Rakim	10	Real Shit	The Master	1999	[Chorus]	"Explain the feeling you get when you hear a smash hit
When the track hit, it's classic, yeah, that's it
For the ladies this is the hatrick, with the back lit
For men that get pornographic with that chick

Illest one of Ra's tactics, now that's sick
Similar to the rush casket with the with a gas bin
In other words, ayo, this is that shit"

Common	22	Dooinit	Like Water for Chocolate	2000	[Verse 3]	"You wasn't saying you was a thug before Pac came
Ten years ago you had a high top trying to be like Kane
Then Snoop released and it became a G thang
Claim sets, your city ain't got gangs
Niggas ain't hate you, they ain't paying you no attention
In a circle of faggots, yo' name is mentioned
With six degrees (You what?), I separate MC's, from a business man that's good (Uh)
From a nigga that was raised or just lived in the hood
From what a nigga says to what's understood
Keep my shit tight like them boys in ""The Wood"" (Yeah)
Dick is always hard like the ""Boyz in the Hood""
Peace to Dug Inf, No I, Sean Lett, the whole Chi
At the crib some cats give me the cold eye
I'ma bitch slap the next one
Let him know the world is my section, to take it
You got to use aggression (Yeah)"
Nas	9	Small World	I Am...	1999	[Verse 2]	"Snook from Red Hook was grimy, did 5 years, glad to be home
From Attica, known for keepin' chrome calibers
Smooth like a Wallaby shoe, he's out to get it
5 years plannin' to blow soon as he hit the bridicks
Had a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low
Played the crib for a month and deaded his P.O
Started robbin' niggas ‘til he caught a whole kilo
He had a bunch of starvin' niggas he owe, he never paid though
Got large, sign on his door, ""Don't knock hard""
Laying with his bitch, ""Niggas is rich"" is what he told her
Played the block, holdin' cracks inside the baby stroller
Here come his crazy soldier, six shots it's over
A year went past, Snook went flossing fast
His old man had crossed his ass for the laws of this fast cash"
Big Boi	26	Tomb of the Boom	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Chorus]	"Tomb after tomb, boom-boom after boom

Dr. Dre	1	One Less Bitch	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Verse 2]	"Now Vicky Vicky Vicky, she's very tricky
She put her hickey on top of my dick, sick bitch, see?
She told me she loved me and she wanted to keep me
If only she can have the dick weekly
I said I'm with it but baby you gotta hold up
If I was happy with somethin' that I could fold up
We can do this - she said her husband was rich
Then I knew I had the bitch
Yo she wrote a check, many a check
In the name of a bitch who was strugglin' at the same game
All I wanted to do was get P-A-I-D
Just a little somethin' for fuckin' me
Yo Everything was cool but Vicky concerned me
Her husband was the District Attorney
So, before he found out he was crossed up
By his bitch I was fuckin' I had her tossed up
And put to sleep, so a nigga never forget
A dead bitch can't tell a nigga shit
One less bitch you gotta worry about
She's outta here and that's how it turned out"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Gotta Eat	Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool	2007	[Chorus]	"My man said life ain't easy

Lupe Fiasco	23	They.Resurrect.Over.New.	Tetsuo & Youth	2015	[Verse 1]	"Dark matter with the sparks scattered up above, velvet hands in the upper glove—touch
Like bad double dutch, and two Amsterdam's ain't enough—D.R.U.G.S. 
""Don't ruin us,"" God said—DROGAS—too much pride we electric slide
We should be closer, like soca, not a chain, but a choker
I see the sun then the clouds then the vultures, pay respects in my sensei's sculpture
High as the angel on Dikembe's shoulder, eyes looking like MKUltra
Redacted vision through these dark shades, bad dreams through the screens of an arcade
Hangin' on the joy like the residues of heartbreak, park full of art, arteries full of parkay
Beating it, like new games, easily defeating
Or two gangs meeting for the evening, or two feet on a Riesling (Yeah!) slow wind
Meditate until there's no mind, decorate me with shine till I go blind
BDSM dominated it with no bind, safe word is ""Don't stop,"" both, or don't go no times"
50 Cent	19	In My Hood	The Massacre	2005	[Chorus]	"In my hood niggas got love for me
But I don’t go nowhere without my strap
In my hood a little ’dro, a little Hennessy
And niggas just don’t know how to act
In my hood niggas is grimey
I stay on point, I roll with my gat
In my hood niggas might buck at me
So I keep something around to buck back
In my hood"

Travis Scott	33	YOSEMITE	ASTROWORLD	2018	[Verse]	"Now that I'm home, back off the road
We shut it down where it ain't so
With checks in the streets, Jay number 4s
Saint Laurent feet, put it on toes
Take it with me, double your dose
Covered with angels that's watchin' my soul
Jet got a bed, it's bigger windows
Said, ""I'll be there in ten,"" but I got there in four"
Eminem	15	My Name Is	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Verse 1]	"Hi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)
And Dr. Dre said, """" (Uh-uh)
""""
Well, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else
'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut; ""Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg""
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off"
2Pac	18	It Ain’t Easy	Me Against The World	1995	[Verse 1]	"I take a shot of Hennessy
Now, I'm strong enough to face the madness
Nickel bag full of cess weed laced with hash
Phone calls from my niggas on the other side
Two childhood friends just died, I couldn't cry
A damn shame, when will we ever change?
And what remains from a 12-gauge to the brain?
Arguments with my boo, it's true
I spend more time with my niggas than I do with you
But everywhere it's the same thang
That's the game, I'll be damned if a thang changed
Fuck the fame, I'll be hustlin' to make a million
Lord knows ain't no love for us ghetto children
So we cold, Rag-top slowin' down, time to stop for gas
Beep my horn for a hoochie with a proper ass
Uh, it ain't easy, that's my motto
Drinkin' Tanqueray straight out the bottle
Everybody wanna know if I'm insane
My baby mama got a mind full of silly games
And all the drama got me stressin' like I'm hopeless
I can't cope, me and the homies smokin' roaches
'Cause we broke, late night, hangin' out 'til the sunrise
Gettin' high, watchin' the cops roll by
It ain't easy; that's right, it ain't easy"
Eminem	15	Bad Guy	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 4]	"I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closin' in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm that denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stackin' up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah, 'cause I'm talkin' a lot of shit, but I'm backin' it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal cords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered comin' back on ya
Every woman you insult, batter, but the double-standard you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
'Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowin' what you had 'til it's gone
'Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say, ""I told you so""
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case better make sure you're packing a wallop (A wallop)"
Kendrick Lamar	16	peekaboo	GNX	2024	[Chorus]	"What they talkin' 'bout?

Nobody move, stand still
Body you, drop that ass off in the landfills
Son blessed me with the iron, I got beef with
Some niggas from the other side over some weak shit
Load up the heaters, greet 'em with the hollow tips
Flip 'em like the Gotti clique, my crew strictly body shit!
The cradle to the grave is where I'll end up
Fuck gettin' sent up North, son, I'm bent up!
Doin' my dirt on the low
Fuckin' with the Mobb is like a trial, no doubt you gonna blow
You never know, he didn't even have to go
There, unprepared, now he's six below
Y'know I'm chillin', I gots no time for catchin' feelings
Get that money I want, some brothers wanna act funny
But it's all good! I still die for the hood

Lupe Fiasco	23	Prisoner 1 & 2	Tetsuo & Youth	2015	[Verse 1]	"They sell they souls, they sell they selves
They ain't twelve, they old, niggas old as hell
Old as jail, old as cells
Sold so much salt, ain't no more salt on the shelves
You a prisoner too, you living here too
You just like us, til' your shift get through
You could look like us, you know shit get through
You should be in cuffs like us, you should get strike two
You should get like life, you should get like woo!
You should get that twice, you should get refused
The open road, that's no parole, and no control
Over your own soul, so control
Your own remote control that your folks can hold"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	Don’t Sweat the Technique	Don’t Sweat the Technique	1992	[Verse 3]	"I speak indiscreet 'cause talk is cheap
Then I get deep in the beat then complete the
Poem's physique, never weak or obsolete
They never grow old, techniques become antiques
Better then something brand new 'cause it's real
And in a while the style’ll have much more value
Classical, too intelligent to be radical
Masterful, never irrelevant, mathematical
Here's some soothing souvenirs
For all the years, you fought and sought the thoughts and ideas
It's cool when you freak to the beat
But don't sweat the technique"
Eminem	15	The Kids	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Verse 3]	"And last but not least, one of the most humongous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure; they pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum-yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes, you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
Like fat women in G-strings with orange hair
(Mr. Shady, what's a G-string?) It's yarn, Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say 'magic mushrooms?' I meant fungus
Your tongue gets all swole up like a cow's tongue
(How come?) 'Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!)
See, drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad know that's all that I'm good at (Eh?)
But don't be me, 'cause if you grow up and you go and OD
They're gonna come for me, and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, 'cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, 'cause I'm bad for you"
Big Boi	26	Elevators {ONP 86 Mix}	ATLiens	1996	[Verse 2]	"Yeah, uhh, check it
Ahh one two, ahh one two dope niggas
In the Cadillac they call us went from Player's Ball to ballers
Puttin the South up on the map was like Little Rock to bangin
Niggas say motherfuck that playin, they payin
We stayin' layin' vo-cals, locals done made it with them big boys
Up in dis industry, Outkast yea dem niggas they makin big noise
Over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly
Ninety-six gon be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me

Kurupt	4	Calling Out Names	Tha Streetz Iz a Mutha	1999	[Verse 1]	"Niggas with hepatitis
Unauthorized hard-to-move arthritis
Infected selected neglected ejected
And next time ya hit the West
You could best believe, believe the best, mothaFUCK the rest
What you supposed to be snatchin'?
You comin' to a world of punctured hearts and jackin'
Lethal illegal overseein' the overview like seagulls
Balls in ya jaws on the hunt like bald eagles
The end of the sequel
I'm the milli-mac and the strong-end and nigga to blame
And I'mma start callin' y'all bitch niggas by name
Mothafuck D, Mothafuck M, only X I know is Xzibit or RBX, extraordinary
Tryna snatch my bitch
You can have the bitch
Two bitches gettin' rich just to come to the West Coast and get stripped down
Beat to death, stripped, all over a bitch
Now it's 50 MC's that ain't worth shit
Get ya ass kicked 50 times, beat to 10 cent
I love New York, but the niggas that represent ya'll ain't shit New York
They actin' like a bitch New York
Buckshot, Noreaga, Jigga, cool
Canibus, Wu-Tang, my niggas, cool
Def Squad and Def Jam but fuck Ja Rule
Irv Gotti I can't wait for Raekwon to break food
Tryna sign Daz, nigga Daz'll sign you
And when you hit the West, this is what we gon' do
Get y'all niggas, slap y'all niggas like bitches
Dippin' through the 'hood on switches
I just bought me a Cadillac last week
Wit' a new bitch since my old bitch tweaked
Naw homeboy, the game just ain't the same
If you wanna know, Kurupt said it, and I'm Callin' Out Names"
Nas	9	Black Girl Lost	It Was Written	1996	[Verse 3]	"Where are you focused? On legit niggas and where the coke is
Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo, you seem hopeless
Your value — too much to be measured, I wonder how you
Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amounting to
More than the world, but not knowing nothing about you
You leaving the crib, taking all your kids out to
Drop 'em off, letting some nigga knock you off
So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost
Growing up seeing it, it should remind you, you being lied to
Everything that move be inside you
Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you
I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to
They spot you out dancing topless in your drawers
Damn, look! There goes a black girl lost"
Eminem	15	Patiently Waiting	Get Rich or Die Tryin’	2003	[Verse 2]	"They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit, they ain't sayin' shit, spray 'em, 50
A to the K, get in the way, I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'? You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats? 'Cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children (Woo), it's nuclear showers
There's nothin' spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50"
The Game	13	Ain’t Fuckin’ With You	LAX	2008	[Verse 1]	"I'm tired of playin' your games, you pissin' me off
I'm watchin' LeBron, so holla when this shit go off
You say I be trippin' but really it's you that be gone
Always bringin' up Tanisha be givin' me dome
I ain't tryin' to hear that, I'm just tryin' to chill
So chill, like Chamillionaire or Mike Jones' grill
All in front of my flat screen, True Religion black jeans
Dancin' like Ciara, I ain't Bow Wow or 50
Tryin' to get me but I back out, I could blow your back out
Lay you down, put it in the hole, like Stackhouse
We used to hit Midtown, throwin' all them stacks out
Run through the Louis Vuitton store and clean the racks out
Used to feel good, when I watch your Porsche back out
You bought Keyshia Cole album, now you tryin' to act out
Flippin' like a Sidekick, tell me what is that 'bout?
You can't take the heat, get the fuck up out of Shaq house
Black out"

You are about to experience somethin' so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty, I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flicking Starter coats, man—man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer, they ain't finna say, ""Next summer, I'm finna...""
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do somethin', man, your ass is grown"
Snoop Dogg	0	Peaches N Cream	BUSH	2015	[Verse 1]	"She too fly for words
And where I'm at now, I'm too high for birds
Shorty, what you think about my return
'Cause what he think about, it ain't my concern
I ain't come for you, I came for your missus
I don't do it for the haters, I do it for the players
Well, okay, I do it for the riches
But in the meantime and in-between time
Shorty right there gon' get it if she with it
If she ain't, then I know her partner down
‘Cause her partner throwin’ shots every time I turn around
And her partner bringin’ partners every time I come to town
I'm a G6er, a Maybacher
You can tell the chauffeur he can park it right thurr
And I'ma walk up to the club upstairs
And when I come down he can bring it back; word"

Snoop Dogg	0	From Tha Chuuuch To Da Palace	Paid Tha Cost To Be Da Bo$$	2002	[Verse 2]	"I do it for the G's and I do it for the hustlers
Here to annihilate you mark-ass busters
Eff the police cause all they wanna do is cuff us
The world is fuckin' chilly as if his name was Usher
But I'm still ridin' them 'llacs, makin them G stacks
And got them cornrows to the back
I ain't really tryin to be picky
But if you give me somethin, it's got to be the sticky
Green by the ounces, low-lows bouncin
Sandy Fay and Annie Mae kissin on my couch and
Ooh to the ouch and, Moet fountain
That's how we get down at the Doggy Dogg House'n
This year we ain't fuck with thousands
We clean with millions that get fly as a falcon

Eminem	15	Remember Me?	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Verse 3]	"When I go out, I'ma go out shootin'
I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid
I'm tryin' to clean up my fuckin' image
So I promised the fuckin' critics I wouldn't say ""fuckin''' for six minutes
(Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinkin' these crazy thoughts
In my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
(Is she really on as much dope as you say she's on?)
Came home and somebody musta broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trench coats
Six sick dreams of picnic scenes
Two kids, sixteen, with M-16s and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets?
Fuck that! Pbbt, you faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
And reappear in hell with a can of gas and a match
Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at

The Game	13	Gentleman’s Affair	LAX	2008	[Verse 3]	"It can't be about C-notes
She know my pockets deep enough to see a deep throat
But she won't see no dividends like three times dope
And that's triple X rated, you know?
My bitches only want the weed, some X, some blow
Know not to ask for the keys or no extra dough
I give em dick, no dough, she give me shit, she go
All she got was a baby and a Game logo
That was then, this is now, lift it up, break it down
I go in, she come out, that's when the pussy make the sound
It will never be the same, every time you fuck with Game
Silk sheets, long dick, hot tub, Lil Wayne
Like I ain't never ran from no pussy
And I damn sure bout to pick today to start running
I said I ain't never ran from no pussy
And I damn sure bout pick today to start running"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Momma	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 3]	"I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile, hand-me-down sneakers
Bounced through the crowd
Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin' on his beady beads, exhausted
Tossin' footballs with his ashy, black ankles
Breakin' new laws, mama passed on home trainin'
He looked at me and said, ""Kendrick, you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted""
Oh, I forgot, ""Don't Kill My Vibe,"" that's right, you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken
But never mind, you're here right now, don't you mistake it
It's just a new trip, take a glimpse of your family ancestor
Make a new list of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit, I know your life is full of turmoil
Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin' you
If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two
But if you pick destiny over rest-in-peace
Then be an advocate, tell your homies, especially
To come back home"""

Daz Dillinger	2	It’s Going Down	Retaliation, Revenge and Get Back	1998	[Verse 2]	"Word on the street is that them DPG niggas shot they homeboy
Now the only sound in the town is gunfire
Going down I sport the crown I give it up on motherfuckers
When I roll through I thought you knew about them Doggs in blue
Now forty-five, niggas rollin' by the spot
I'm on alert I'm down to work every nigga that I shot
Niggas skeet out quick, around the block who know we comin back
Post up early on the attack
Slowly but surely spot an enemy slippin out his domain
Rode up on him and let him see the twelve gauge
The homey Ty banged him on GP because we stuffed him then we bagged him
Cause he violated the rule of the streets
Two redrums under my belt, and felt good bout the murder
Haven't you ever heard of a murderer motherfucker?
Cause I'm, a straight gangsta, doin what I feel
Niggas no need to tempt, for me to kill, straight blastin
The enemy, can't see those who try to get with me
Understand where I'm comin from the D-P to the G-the-C
The niggas who trip, niggas that dipped
Niggas that conversate with the Bloods or Crips
It's just a West coast thang, gangsta thang
Niggas come around here but surely can't hang because-a
We don't hang with no bustas and sho' nuff
Don't hang with no fags and niggas down to blast, straight merkin"
The Game	13	The Documentary 2	The Documentary 2	2015	[Verse 2]	"I taught myself how to spit from listening to It Was Written
My first bars wasn't dope but I had that in the kitchen
Suge wouldn't listen, Irv wouldn't listen
So I ran around with Diddy, Aftermath in the Mission
I would never ask another man for permission I do me
Fuck the Illuminati, I'd rather ride around in hoopties
But now it's the Ghost, my gold Ds is two threes
Still hop in the freestyle, kick it like two Bruce Lee's
Cut open the noose leaves
Foreign on the hill like it's Lauryn
Smoking la la like the Fugees
Thinking to myself, is it God or Lucy?
Prada or Gucci, popping Cris', Rihanna, Karrueche
Homie I ain't gotta gas I'm so ahead of you fags
The shit I spit off Premo tracks burn confederate flags
Take the roof off roof, gimme Proof back and 2Pac
Westside, but you already knew that"

I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch

Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it"
Eminem	15	Godzilla	Music to Be Murdered By	2020	[Verse 3]	"If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable

I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational (*scratch*), ""Back is the incredible!""
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the Internet
Tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed (Uh)
It's a sick world we live in these days

Geez, you guys are so sensitive
""Slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it""
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic whose eyes get so squinted
I'm blind from smoke in 'em with my windows tinted
With nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em
With a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo-scented
And that's where I get my name from
That's why they call me—"

From any angle, as I get buck on ducks
All the sexy girlies wanna push up close to
The man with the most who don't flaunt his ego
Some motherfuckers ain't as gifted
Not everyone can move the crowd and uplift it
I'm swift with the shit like a bullet's trajectory
So don't stand next to me
It's like a warm sensation when my shells hit
You were wrong, you know what you did, so you fell quick
To the pavement, no signs of body movement
See I knew it, yo, I had to do it
And it's cool to duel, but don't slip up, fool
'Cause I'ma leave you dead and stinkin' like a cesspool
And all the chicks know what's goin' on
'Cause baby, there ain't no sunshine when I'm gone
And you can beg for me to stay and parlay
But sorry, I gots to go, got bills to pay
See, by nature, I'm godly
When I touch the mic, it's never too hard for me
To let out a mass amount of mad clout
Huh, me and my gang's gonna swarm

Hoe niggas, this year I'll show niggas — think I'm slippin'?
I'm about to send you a roommate, no bullshittin'
But my hustle's goin' too well to hit him
You was right, niggas want you to be miserable with them
Anyway, I ain't tryin' to hear it, I think I'm touched
This whole verse I been talkin' to your spirit a little too much"

G-5-5 fly, ma, let’s go
It’s hard to measure the pleasure of havin’ you in my presence
Your smile makes me smile, I’ll show you my style
You can shop a little bit, I’ll pick out some shit
One pair at a time ’til your shoe game sick
Now who knows what the future holds we’ll be together probably
For better or worse, like Whitney and Bobby
If you wanna play house, we can play house then
But wait, why pretend when you can move in?
Before I be your buddy in bed let me be your best friend
Girl, it’s more than lust, I want your trust
You keep it real with me, I keep it real with you
Cause I know with you by my side there’s nuttin' I can’t do, yeah"
Big L	25	Holdin’ It Down	The Big Picture	2000	[Verse 1]	"Yo, y'all fellas like to stress them chicks, impress them chicks
Spend money to dress them chicks
I sex them chicks and send 'em home
Corleone is known to be stoned
When I bone, I'm rubbered up in case that shit full blown
The other night around 8 P.M
Pockets crazy slim, jumped out the grey BM
Went to the ATM, took a thou' out
Then later on, I had to wild out
In the club, knocked some coward and his pal out
Then afterwards went to the restroom, pissed Cristal out
Now I'm thinkin' which chick number I could dial out?
'Cause it's L, the Harlem pimp, baby, for real
I got more dimes than that Sprint lady, and that's ill
Playa haters be givin' me harsh looks
But I'm tryin' to sell records like Garth Brooks
So F 'em all, when it's cold I throw the skelly on
Illegal chips keep my celly on
Mega-ice is what I'm heavy on
If it ain't Cristal, boo, I guess it's Perignon
If the na-na's too tight, I throw some jelly on
Yo, try to tax and watch the 9 mill burst
I've been off the scene over three years and cats is still thirst
To hear Big L drop an ill verse
So all you unsigned cats that wanna battle — get a deal first!
I sport the bulletproof, fitted hat
That attitude — you better get rid of that
Wherever you floss is where you gon' get it at
What?! I stay strapped, I go to sleep with my steel
Makin' figures while you broke cats is keepin' it real
L is rap most livest cat
I'm gettin' stacks while you askin' people ""Do you want fries with that?""
I rob fags in the staircase, no mask, bare-faced
The one police wouldn't dare chase
Keep my gear laced
Do I walk around without papes? No way, pal!
Word up! My money longer than the O.J. trial"

Smashin hits, make it hard to adapt to this
Put pizzazz and jazz in this, and cash in this
Mastered this, flash this and make em clap to this
DJ's throw on cuts and obey the crowd
Just pump the volume up, and play it loud
Hip-Hop's embedded, before I said I wouldn't let it
But me and the microphone is still magnetic
Straight off the top, I knew I'd be forced to rock
Dancefloors just stop, the spot's scorchin hot
Hoping I open Rakim Allah seminars
Massage at the bar smokin ten dollar cigars
While I admire midas, with more vision than TV's
I find it easy catching diabetes from fly sweeties
Sit back and wait to hear a slammin track
Rockin jams by popular demand, I'm back"

Pictures of actions be played back in the midst of mashin'
No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlers hardly think of culture
Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars, and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetery
Here's a message to the newborns waitin' to breathe
If you believe, then you can achieve: just look at me!
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me, protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious; just smile for me now!"

Back in the days we played practical jokes on
Everybody smoked with they locs and they yokes on
All through high school, girls by the dozens
Saying we cousins, knowing that we wasn't
But like the old saying goes
Times goes on and everybody grows
Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways
You chose the dope game, my microphone pays
In many ways we were paid in the old days
So far away from the crazies with AKs
And though I been around, clowning with the Underground
I'm still down with my homies from the hometown
And if you need, need anything at all
I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call"

They told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say, ""You need to go and see that!""
And everybody claps, 'cause everybody is pleased

And nowadays, girls want you for your money
I'm like Heav', I got nothin' but love for you, honey

It was all a scheme I used to load the teck with the magazine
So I was mean but I still had a scheme
17 years young everything seemed fun
Still considered a veteran cause I feared none
Pun's from the street where there ain't no rules
But carried heat cause he ain't no fool
Ain't no room for doubters and negative niggas
So debted followers and got rid of the quitters
That never forget us cause we've been down since the
Genesis 200 horse power to 400 Pegasus
The messages don't sleep till its over
Next thing you know shorty seven feet
Tippin' over I'm still in the water drownin'
Knights and murder till the immortal terror squad
Threw me a life preserver now im ice forever
Stomach bustin' out the white carrera
Life is better now niggas wanna rhyme together
¡Ay qué será! What can I do but take you to strive
¡Ay qué hago! I hope the streets don't take me alive
You wasted your life and refused the struggle while
I aim for the sky pay dues and bubbles I WIN!"

Maybe help you advance, like Prince did Apollonia
You looking right I see you hooking tonight
But something about you, got me pushing up tight
Do that dance like Aphrodite cause you mighty
You might be the chick that make me trip just slightly
Ya eyes glisten, your breasts, ass and thighs is hittin
If it ain't love, then this thug is just smitten

Told the truth to get what I want, but shot it with no shame
Take this music dead serious while others entertain
I see they're making their paper so I guess I can't complain
Or can I? I feel they're disrespecting the whole thang
Them hooks like selling dope to black folks
And I choke when the food they serving ain't tasting right
My stomach can't digest it even when I bless it
I'm confessing one more lesson from the South, we in the house tonight
Now hootie who wants to oppose? Suppose
We rolls through Headland and Delowe
Where me and my niggas would pass the flow
And got down for ours like hind catchers
My mind catches flashbacks to the black past
While mind close niggas laugh at
The Southern slang, finger waves and Mojo chicken wangs
I grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thang
So go 'head and, diss it, while real hop-hippers listen
Started by Afrika Bambaataa, so you and your partner
Gather your thoughts (""Ninety-six gonna be that year""...)"

This faggot-ass cat should get clapped for even tryin'
He tried to confront me, but only faced iron
Put holes through your shirt like Jamaican clothes
Fuck the myths, but science and numbers is how I live
If we ain't gettin' mathematics, somethin' got to give
Broke all your fucking life with no will to live
There's no way to live, resort to Plan B
Start to sticking, strongarm robbery and icepicking
It's sneak vicking, it's cold outside
I think it's past time for me to grab the clapper and take mines
You follow what I'm saying? It's like leading the blind
Trying to voice a clear picture of this life of crime
You slow learners'll understand in due time
Up the ladder of success with TECs, we trying to eat
And put that fly shit on my back
And bless my feet with some new and improved, spectate or make a move
Hesitate or regulate, it's on you"

Where skinny niggas make buff niggas victims of that trey-pound (Brrr-ah)
And gangbangers is the sharpshooters, we don't need no rooftops
Just knock his ass down and take the money out his tube socks
West Coast niggas is back on the map
If only for now until the next time I body a track
From the first clap I hurt rap, now watch the earth crack
Bring the hearse back, and take a lyrical dirt nap
I roll with the hardest niggas, make money with the smartest niggas
I ain't got time for you fuckin artist niggas
Better shut your trap before you become a target nigga
Y'all army brats I'm the motherfuckin sargeant nigga
Beauty pageant-ass niggas on the runway
+Boyz N The Hood+ 'til they see the nigga in that red Hyundai
Blow his fuckin back out, cause I'm the rap Stackhouse
Black Wall Street bitch, the hip-hop crackhouse, what?"

Reporting live from the hive and all sides of the sludge
One deep meditate, one street separate
""Hi"" to the Crips, ""Goodbye"" to the Bloods
But it was the Souls, the Lords and GDs
Segregated by the street in the Chi' where I was
Got wise to the nudge
Why buy a tub when they bayou'll flood? Better buy you a sub
How you gon' survive in the club?
You gon' kayak it 'cause when it rise up above
And the waves come in push and the tidals'll shove
What's an infrared dot to a whole dot gov?

Got caught, fought, lost, electrocuted to death
Came a little late for the rescue and the flesh
DNA exonerates posthumously whatever's left
No resurrection but reputation's correct
The revelation brings decorated regrets
All due respect, it's not really about fair
Collective sigh 'cause the real killer's still out there
Probably calling up police
Complaining 'bout his neighbours or just walking on the beach
Why should he have such views of the ocean?
And not be hanging from the gallows with his neck neatly broken?
I let it soak in, then I put the soap in
Then I put the boats in, then I play with both them
The hot tub's now lookin' like a yacht club
Makin' sure I get all of the shoes like a bot does
Neighbor is pissed
Tells the cops ""if he wants to bathe like a sailor
Live on a container ship""
I party all night and the bangin' is intense
'Cause I know exactly what you did
And you gon' pay for it, you bitch"
Guru	20	What I’m Here 4	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 2]	"Peace to the young ladies, who wanna bone me much
And peace to my nigga Premier, with the golden touch
I never fall off point, like DeNiro in Casino
Peace to Black Gambinos and all my peoples
Dig the steelo, I'm fightin' wars you know
As in the Jihad, most humble, most merciful
That's because I be God, I trog through fogs, puffing logs
MC's muttering menial madness, they get marred
Scarred and barred, and then, banished from my fuckin' kingdom
You got a fly one bring one, or else I come to fling some
Exquisite exotic exciting type shit
Enough to make the real heads wake up and get hype quick
I'm type slick, known as the God Universal
Kick rhymes without rehearsal, I cross the burnin sands
Now I stand here with virtue, of course I could hurt you
Simply with my point of view, and I knew
That many would come, that's why I've chosen
To cut off pathways and there's no runways or doorways open
For the jokers who ain't focused
And all the fake mercenaries get buried by the tongue of terrifying fury
Nothing's blurry, fuck it I got no worries
Hearts and minds shine bright light with insight
Yeah since my birthright to set up cyphers with power
'Cause mad shit ain't right, like punks in the spotlight
Who can't freestyle, sometimes I make my peeps smile
By sayin somethin crazy wild
Like some shit off my dome that be soundin'
Better than the next man's whole album..."

Whoever did it even got Jordan for his ice
Said that it was done so precise the cops ain't know nut-nin
Had to use all my might not to ask no questions
Put down the magazine, went to the pop machine
Noticin these cats, had the Bling Bling
They wouldn't be talkin if they did it; it could be they team
A week ago neither one of these niggas had a ring
This hype came in, sellin CD's; said the BD's
Was braggin bout robbery they had done
By now, I'm thinkin bout my gun if I
See gramps bracelet
I'mma play racist (and what?) and make niggas run

I had to work for mine to show I was a true hog
When I was a teenager I tried to be down
But since they wasn't trying to hear me I made the Dogg Pound
I saw a crew on 2-1 street and said, ""Can I be down champ?""
They said no, and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected, I ain't run off the set
I sat and wrote some Dogg doo-doo rhymes at my rest
When I used to go to parties, they'd make me wait
Would have to beg to get on the mic to set MCs straight
I ain't never love no hoes I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep on hanging with the juzi

And plus I'm a nigga with that feelin' like it's my time
And anybody standin' in the way of that is dyin'
I bust nine, how many times I gotta warn you?
I ain't the one who pushin' buttons in the sight of my gun
I'm the real live version of the Corleone family
So I spit this clearly, so you hoes'll understand me"
MC Ren	17	Prelude	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Verse 2]	"Most niggas can't understand
And never will if they ain't part of the Ruthless mafia clan
Niggas is dedicated to the streets
With hype fuckin lyrics and the dope-ass beats
The songs will never come soft, because I come off
So don't get in my way cause motherfucker you'll get cut off
And it's somethin you can move your lips to
To wrap around my dick and suck if it fits you
And let me now if you wanna ride the D-I-C-K
All day that's with no play
Cause ain't no rap group out that I know
That make me wanna listen to the radio
All I hear is motherfuckers tryin to make a comeback
With lovesongs, and that shit is wack
And that's why your ass ain't around
Cause you don't have the motherfuckin sound
Of a real nigga
(YEAH MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!)"
2Pac	18	Temptations	Me Against The World	1995	[Verse 1]	"Tell me, baby are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if you only let me touch ya
If I'm wrong, love, tell me 'cause I get caught up
In the life I live, it's Hell see, I never thought I'd
See the day when I would calm down, you ain't heard?
I've been known to clown and get around, that's my word
See you walking and you looking good, yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killing me
With your attitude to match, right? Don't be phony
'Cause I hate it when you act like you don't know me
I've been stressing in the spotlight, I want the fame
But the industry's a lot like a crap game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be with you every minute miss another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand (Look here)
I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go..."
The Game	13	My Life	LAX	2008	[Verse 1]	"Take me away from the hood, like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley
Take me away
Like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain
Suicide, I'm from a windy city like Do or Die
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fuckin' reason
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces? 
‘Cause that's Jesus' people
And Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much,  need a sequel, yeah
Like Roc-A-Fella needed Sigel, like I needed my father
But he needed a needle 
I need some meditation so I can lead my people
They askin', ""Why
Why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?""
And why every hood nigga feed off evil?
Answer my question 'fore this bullet leave this Desert Eagle"
Common	22	Watermelon	Resurrection	1994	[Verse 1]	"I express like an interstate
Hyper when I ventilate
My rap pieces penetrate and infiltrate your mental state
Just to reiterate
That I innovate
Bonin' broads when they men-estruate
I spend a great time with the rhyme
More than I did any female
I derailed your train of thought
Because your brain was caught
On some other man's thinking
Now your third eye is blinking
My rhymes be kicking like a brother's breath was stinking
I get funky for sure while you're *sniff* unsure
If you got beef, chief, then let that shit unthaw
This track was a broad
I'd be bonin the shit out of it
Bang, bang, bang then see what I can get out of her
Probably some scratch clothes and some J's
I got six million ways to rhyme
Choose one
I stand out like a nigga on a hockey team
I got goals, and I can like a pop machine
I come clean
Like a fiend in Chi I'm down with rehab
Stir my style crazy
Cause that's right, we bad, we bad
Pryor to Richard I was that crazy nigga
Cause I kick ass
And when I wreck it other rappers be like ""whiplash!"""
Nas	9	Suspect	It Was Written	1996	[Verse 1]	"It was a murder — Jake just hit the corner, people swarmin'
Three in the mornin', I jumped out my cab like ""Fuck!""
Niggas is buck, mega bloodshed, the tape's red
I heard some bird whisper, ""Yo, he should've ducked""
I puffed the lila, just before I hit the scene for real-er
I'm all high, it's late, I'm lookin' down at the fella
Shit's pushed in, ambulance placed him on some cushion
His moms had a stare I wouldn't dare second look when I murk
It hurt, kinda took it as a brief reminder
That the street's designed to stop ya life clock, the beast'll time ya
Cell to cell, suspect-ass nigga, you fail
First time locked in Comstock, my mind blocks the frail
Burstin', blastin' at you, forty cal' shells split your dry cell
My niggas never snitch, why tell?
We roll wit' no regrets, destinies, fifties and equities
Queens'll be the death of me!"
Kendrick Lamar	16	The Spiteful Chant	Section.80	2011	[Verse 1]	"Everything I do is too alumni
I'ma take my time, I'ma master it
You should be mindful of a mastermind
Put a landmine right where your momma live
Now blow up, blow up, hold up, I've seen your kind before
See me as a dollar sign 'til I resign or you report
That I done you wrong, and I'm leaning on my own  endeavors
Nigga right now, it's now or never
Nigga right now, I'm high as ever, but however..."
Eminem	15	Those Kinda Nights	Music to Be Murdered By	2020	[Verse 2]	"This beat keeps takin' me back like my ex does
Only 'cause how good the sex was
Hit up the next club, met Alexa
But she was so extra, called her et cetera
Had her like, ""Oh my God
My whole iPod's filled with your songs, I mow my lawn to 'em""
I said, ""Oh my God, you know my songs?
That's totally awesome, I'm Marshall, what's goin' on? Ah (Haha)
Seriously though, jokes aside, how you doin'? You straight?""
She said, ""No, I'm bi""
She said, ""Are you drunk?,"" I said, ""No, I'm high
I'm checkin' out the chick,"" she said, ""So am I""
""What's in the cup, let me see that
Girl, where the rest of that promethazine at?""
She said, ""Cool, gotta run out to my Cadillac though
And I'll be like Fat Joe, and bring the lean back""
Then I said"
JAY-Z	6	Heart of the City (Ain’t No Love)	The Blueprint	2001	[Verse 2]	"And then the Fugees gon' break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody got somethin' to say
What's all the fuckin' fussin' for?
Because I'm grubbin' more?
And I pack heat like I'm the oven door?
Niggas pray and pray on my downfall
But every time I hit the ground, I bounce up like roundball
Now, I don't wanna have to kill soundboys
Don't wanna have to cock back the four-pound bar
Look, scrapper, I got nephews to look after
I'm not lookin' at you dudes, I'm lookin' past ya
I thought I told you characters I'm not a rapper
Can I live?
I told you '96 that I came to take this shit and I did
Handle my biz, I scramble like Randall with his
Cunningham, but the only thing runnin' is numbers, fam
Jigga held you down six summers, damn, where's the love?"
JAY-Z	6	Allure	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 2]	"I'm like a Russian mobster, drinking distilled vodka
Until I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real
Peel the top up like a toupée, mix the water with the soda
Turn the pot up, make a soufflé
All of y'all can get it like group-page on your two-way
I'm living proof that crime do pay
Say ""hooray"" to the bad guy, and all the broads
Putting cars in their name, for the stars of the game
Putting 'caine in their bras and their tomorrows on the train:
All in the name of love
Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
Over the house to take back everything that they claimed
Or even the worse pain is the distress
Learning you're the mistress only after that love gets slain
And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
Now it gets tough to ever love again
But the allure of the game, keeps calling your name
To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain
To all the Christies in every cities and Tiffany Lanes:
We all hustlers in love with the same thing"
Eminem	15	Underground	Relapse	2009	[Chorus]	"Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now

Lookin' for me? I'm underground"
Big Boi	26	Bowtie	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse 1]	"Nasty Noompsy Knightingale, fresh in that tuxedo
Cummerbund with no suspenders, my torpedo, you libido
Need to chat (Chip-chop it up, shoot the breeze)
I'm your R-O-L-A-I-D-S, release the squeeze
Or release the keys to the shackles on her wrist
She can tackle some of this, smack on, smack on some of this
Dick Tracy, arrest her, book her, fingerprint your hooker
You took her to the club and now her body's full of liquor
Off that Butterscotch Schnapps and Bailey's Irish Cream
She's a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things
Whatcha mean? (Chip, chop it up, shoot the breeze)
In the parking lot we primp, crooked booty to the scene, wearing"
Prodigy	8	Cradle to the Grave	The Infamous	1995	[Verse 7]	"Triple L, rollin' dice while I put you on
To the drama, what I gotta say is short, not long
This nigga that I'm beginnin' to dislike, he got me fed
If he doesn't discontinue his bullshit, he might be dead!
You know him well, and probably go way back
But I don't care if he's your man doin' shit like that
I hope the word gets back to him, 'cause I'll screw him
He shitted on my man, and we got plans to do him
Lets get it over with quick, I'm tired of waitin'
Ain’t no fear over here, dear, we just debatin'
On when and how, later or right now
Spoke to Killa yesterday, he said to chill for a while
But it's hard actin' like everything is alright
I get the chills when I see that nigga in my eyesight
A dead man walkin', not only that, he's still talkin'
(About what?) About how and what he did very often
You don't know how much I fiend to put his ass in a coffin
One day — my man, and the next — he's not
Didn't know him long anyway, so fuck it!
It's funny how things change (Word up!)"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Blur My Hands	Tetsuo & Youth	2015	[Verse 1]	"Take time to learn me like court-appointed attorneys
Restore the order, we either join or adjourning
Less you join, I'm up performing the journey
In all earnest, I go so Bernie
Takes another nigga to turn me
Get it straight, I ain't late on states
I'm just sternly stating
How what I do, with grace takes another nigga to turn mean
My returning's like Blockbuster with a tape
And I ain't kind but I don't hit
So you starting at the end, that's the part where you begin
I skip the bullshit so we can start it where we win
Yeah, spoiler alert
I can hear you all saying, ""Boy, you're a jerk""
But it's cool though, know we gotta rule yo
Get it in, then we win and do it all again, ho"

Smokin' hella weed, I'm on that alcohol
Shawty lick me clean the way she suck me off
I keep two hoes in my bed, I got 'em turnin' out
What would you do if you heard I got it goin' on?
I had to burn, I left skrrt marks, I had to dip
Gotta watch for 12 'round my town, you might get killed

You cop it live, boy, I got it all on film"

I give it to you just how you like it, girl
You're now rockin' with the best
Four pound on my hip, gold chain on my chest (Ahh)
You ready? Here it come
Call Lloyd Banks and get this motherfucker crunk

I want ya hat to yo' clothes, 'cause dollars make sense

He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end, it seems I'm headin' for the pen'
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night, my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up, huh
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Said it ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy, huh
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive 'cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up"
Scarface	11	Safe	The Fix	2002	[Verse 1]	"You're down and out, money funny, you hustle and die
On the verge of pawnin your jewelry and sellin your ride
Somebody shoulda told him ain't no life in these streets
You only out here 'til you touch it, when you touch it you eat
Niggas done took too many chances shovelin snow
And ended up facin a lifetime for tryin to sco'
I'm givin livin definitions on the subject of dope
One week he back on his feet, the next he's WHOA
I was a 70's baby, raised in the 80's
I was barely touchin 16 when shit got crazy
I remember in the 80's, me and pop would ride
Now we conversate on acres we's about to buy
He had already been what I'm about to go through
Told me ain't no sense in gamblin if you gamble to lose
If you made twelve dollars, you put seven away
And lived off the five, and never ever fuck with your safe
But when"
Big Boi	26	Unhappy	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse 2]	"Once upon a rhyme, one time when I was a child
When I found out that Santa Claus was nothing more than Vanilli
It was silly, 'cause my mom and pop, they worked for every penny
Didn't have many, but had enough to get by
Enough to get fly, only to start the New Year off in debt
Now you forget your happiness came and went
Like mom and dad's relationship, take a trip, you bring potato chips
I'll bring the hot sauce"

Left me at the pad with his girl, damn, what the deal?
Now baby got a gown on, gettin her clown on
As she slid downstairs, now she takin me down home
Cheatin in the next room in the homeboy's bedroom
Am I wrong? Shit, on and on and on and on
Now what am I to do if you was me and I was you
His baby momma in my face, she shakin poo-poo, what would you do?
Trust is a motherfuckin loco, shit
And so is temptation, and I don't know what I'mma do

Pistol popping activist with the key to the bucket
I rip your pockets of the side of your pants
You glare to the side and you glance, I’m in my G4 stance
How the fuck you make it this far?
No matter where you at, or who you are
People treat me like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
I hear ooh's and aah's when I jumps in my car
Just from last night you can tell
That I'm addicted to the fast life (Addicted to the fast life)

JO's, they lust my flow, but ayo, I don't trust a soul
That's all I know or need to, these evil streets'll
Meet you halfway and eat you alive tryin' to survive illegal
I'll leave you lost, mount you on a cross
Whip you like a horse, sacrifice your life to a higher force
Then I'll stomp your corpse, it's the Bronx of course, recognize the accent
One of the last livin' still-in-action general assassins
Catchin' any wreck, blastin' any TEC, smashin' any chest
Passin' any test; Charles Manson in the flesh
Any last requests before you meet your maker?
Sow what you reap or wake up, shakin' up a storm, like Anita Baker
I'll take you straight to Hell and fill your heart with hate
Incarcerate your fate in Satan's fiery lake, then I lock the gate
Make no mistake, this shit as real as Joe, we follow the killer's code
When we come for you, tell me: where will you go?
Nowhere to run, hide, I'll find you and silence your screams
And even if you kill me, I'll still be in your fuckin' dreams"

Nigga, I—I'm 'bout to go golfing, man

50 Cent	19	Your Life’s On The Line	Get Rich or Die Tryin’	2000	[Verse 3]	"These cats always escape reality when they rhyme (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
That's why they write about bricks and only dealt with dimes (Yeah)
Leave it to them, and they say they got a fast car
NASCAR, truck with a crash bar
And TVs in the dash, pa
See 'em in the five with stock rims (Hahaha), I just laugh, pa
I catch stunts when I ain't trying, I ain't lying
I sip Dom P 'til I spit up, keep my wrist lit up
Get outta line, I get you hit up (Woo)
Now if you say my name in your rhyme, you better watch what you say
You get carried away, you could get shot and carried away
Now here's a list of MCs that could kill you in eight bars
50, um, JAY-Z and Nas
I'ma say this shit now and never again
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners, and we damn sure ain't friends
The games you playing, you get killed like that
Acting like you all hard, you ain't built like that
See me when you see me, nigga, what?"
Daz Dillinger	2	One By One	Dogg Food	1995	[Verse 3]	"I roll swift as a pigeon
Diggin' niggas' graves and tombstones alone
One-on-one, microphone or phone
Stampedin' like a herd of buffalo, you tumble! (Tumble!)
Now, when you try to get up, muthafucka, you stumble! (Stumble!)
Now, it's a must that I combust from the shot from my 12 gauge
Dust to get you high and blown, in the meanwhile
My profile of my style's unusual from a buckwild child
But in the meanwhile... (Yeah!)
I can kill that ass softly like a Al B. song
I maul fifty MC's, divided just by one
Now, who's da greatest muthafucka other than myself?
Droppin' lyrical vitamins for ya health, muthafucka!"

Please don’t make me lie to you, lady
I’m in it, I’m not in it

At the club we finna go
Sip some drink and hit some dro
It’s okay if you don’t go
I’ll make sure to tell you 'bout these

Gang Starr	21	Moment of Truth	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 2]	"Sometimes you gotta dig deep when problems come near
Don't fear, things get severe for everybody everywhere
Why do bad things happen to good people?
Seems that life is just a constant war between good and evil
The situation that I'm facin' is mad amazin'
To think such problems can arise from minor confrontations
Now I'm contemplatin' in my bedroom pacin'
Dark clouds over my head, my heart's racin'
Suicide? Nah, I'm not a foolish guy
Don't even feel like drinkin' or even gettin' high
'Cause all that's gonna do really is accelerate
The anxieties that I wish I could alleviate
But wait, I've been through a whole lot of other shit before
So I oughta be able to withstand some more
But I'm sweatin' though, my eyes are turnin' red and yo
I'm ready to lose my mind, but instead I use my mind
I put down the knife and take the bullets out my 9
My only crime was that I'm too damn kind
And now some scandalous motherfuckers wanna take what's mine
But they can't take the respect that I've earned in my lifetime
And you know they'll never stop the furious force of my rhymes
So like they say, every dog has its day
And like they say, God works in a mysterious way
So I pray, rememberin' the days of my youth
As I prepare to meet my moment of truth"

There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out (Thangs out)
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfuckin' tape in court

Eminem	15	Asshole	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 2]	"Quit actin' salty! I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he roundabout
Dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history, well goddamn, honky
That compliment's like backhandin' a donkey
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him
But what the fuck's all this trash-talkin' about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me
You knocked me down, I went down for the count
I fell, but the fans caught me, and now
You're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me
To take my belt—word to Pacquiao
Momma said, ""There ain't nothin' else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out
Or you better not come out!""
It's poetry in motion
Like Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shakespeare
So what if insults are revoltin'?
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled
But you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess
Gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest
And a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage
Rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts
And all those water bottles in Colorado, so get lost, Waldo
My soul's escapin' through this asshole that is gapin'
A black hole and I'm swallowin' this track whole
Better pack toilet paper, but I'm takin' no crap, ho
Here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changin' back into that old maniac
In fact, there they go tryna dip out the back door retreatin'
‘Cause everybody knows"
Gang Starr	21	Work	Moment of Truth	1998	[Chorus]	"I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see

I've been layin', waitin' for your next mistake
I put in work, and watch my status escalate"
Nas	9	Carry On Tradition	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Verse 1]	"Some rap pioneers be them crackheads
When they speak, you see missin' teeth
Silver chain with a silver piece
Niggas your grandfather's age, they pants still hangin' down they legs, talkin' about they ain't paid
And they hate you, ‘cause they say you ain't pay dues

2Pac	18	Young Niggaz	Me Against The World	1995	[Verse 2]	"Back in Junior High, when we was barely gettin' by, when daddy died
That's when my momma started gettin' high
My neighborhood was full of drive-bys, couldn't survive
All our homies livin' short lives, I couldn't cry
Told my momma, if I did die, just put a blunt in my casket
Let me get my dead homies high
Come follow me throughout my history
It's just Me Against the World stuck in misery; as a young nigga
My only thing was to be paid
Life full of riches, avoid snitches 'cause they shady, back in the days
We always found the time to play
But that's before they taught them gangbangers how to spray
Not just L.A., but in the Bay and in Chicago and even St. Louis
Every stadium that I go, when will they change?
Stuck in the game like a dumb nigga
Remember how it was to be a young nigga"
MC Ren	17	Alwayz Into Somethin’	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Verse 2]	"I heard a dope beat, somebody told me that Buck did it
But if Dre didn't do it, I can't fuck with it
N.W.A is like a mix a fix a trix
Real niggas with big dicks
You're takin' a chance when you think that
Talkin' under your breath won't lead to young death
Fuckin' up shit, ain’t shit but a killin'
For a nigga labeled as bein' a motherfuckin' villain
But you don't know me, a record can't tell ya
How so many prayed I'd be a motherfuckin' failure
Real niggas got to have top rankin'
I hooked up with three more niggas and started makin'
Funky-ass shit for your system
Might sound nice so it makes you wanna listen to a
Sample of a ruthless organization
But you don't want a confrontation
Real niggas don't play
Yella, Eazy, me, and the nigga, nigga Dre
Yo, always makin' sure that my shit is steady bumpin'
A nigga always into somethin'"

Lupe Fiasco	23	Streets on Fire	Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool	2007	[Verse 1]	"Disease, the virus is spreading in all directions
No safe zone no cure and no protection
No symptoms define the signs of an infection
No vaccines, remedies, and no corrections
Quarantine the dreams and seal off the connections
Don't let them in, not a friend, not a reflection
Everybody's got it and want you to have it next and
Don't accept them if you want to stay as an exception
No pill can heal the ill of this
Sickness, some are still in doubt of its existence
Some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance
Some say it's an exit and some say it's an entrance
The poor say the rich have the cure
The rich say the poor are the source
Revolutionaries say it's psychological war
Invented by the press, just to have something to report
Some say the first case came from a maternity ward
Some say a morgue, some say the skies, some say the floors
Whores say the nuns, nuns say the whores
And everybody is sure
The scientist say it only affects the mind
The little boy said it only affects the girls
The preacher man said it's going to kill off the soul
A bum said it's gonna kill the whole wide world"
50 Cent	19	Disco Inferno	The Massacre	2004	[Chorus]	"Lil mama, show me how you move it

از شنیدن راجب مامانم، اوه-هو، وهو-هو
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
اما این فقط یه داستانه از وقتی که فقط یه کوتوله بودم
And how I became hooked on Va-aliu-um

Valium was in everything, food that I ate

She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
اون به اندازه کافی ازش می‌پاشید تا استیکم رو مزه دار کنه
So every day I'd have at least three stomachaches
برای همین هر روز حداقل سه شکم درد داشتم
Now tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her

How's it going, girlfriends? You needs a boyfriend?
You need some ointment? Just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first? We'll do a coin flip
I just got my one-year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get?
Baby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip
I'm going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit
And attempt to separate 'em and stitch 'em back at the loin, shit
Lure the little boy with the chocolate 'Chips Ahoy!' chip
Cookie, lookie, even took me a Polaroid pic"

Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed (Watch out, cuz)
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery, the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up (Sup?)
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons, but still'll never know my life

Game is life, life is struggle
Without the coastal juggle
So if you drop I test that, fragile as a crystal
(Will you get mad and go pull out your pistol?)
Or will you be a man and pick up all the pieces
And put it back together and remain tougher than leather
As for me I'm tryin to keep it real Dogg
All I wanna do is make the whole crowd bounce y'all"
Travis Scott	33	I KNOW ?	UTOPIA	2023	[Chorus]	"Tell me, is you still up? (Up)
It's 5 a.m. and I'm drunk right now
Tell me, can we still fuck? (Fuck that shit)
One of one, I'm in the zone right now
Tell me, am I still? (Mm)
Tellin' you just how I feel right now
You said it's just the drugs and I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I lied too, way before (Let's go), before
Before I had you right inside my arms
But then again, I could be drunk"
Rakim	10	Real Shit	The Master	1999	[Verse 3]	"You know what this is, yeah kid, give up your riches
Vicious, visions is not for motion pictures
Unstoppable, rollin' witcha sickest clique of niggas
Or witcha missus, gettin tropical kisses
Makin' faces, anticipatin' places her tongue hits
Suck her neck or just peck, better to funk it
The EP is in effect from dusk to sunset
She want a rim shot all over her drum set
Jump the bed rubbin' your head- it's rough sex
50 ways to keep a love wet
Down and up the steps with crazy positions left till she upset
""Damn, baby, you ain't cum yet?""
Hell, no- doomstick big as a elbow
Gel soft, well blow, give him a minute, he'll grow
And all you gotta do is play the track again
I'm ready and revived, baby, back again"

Want a drop top on the beach (Straight up)
Gettin' me hot, yeah (Yeah)
Under my feet
When I wake up"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	My Melody	Paid in Full	1986	[Verse 4]	"I'm not a regular competitor, first rhyme editor
Melody arranger, poet, et cetera
Extra events, the grand finale like bonus
I am the man they call the microphonist
With wisdom, which means wise words being spoken
Too many at one time, watch the mic start smoking
I came to express the rap I manifest
Stand in my way and I'll veto, all the word's protest
Emcees that wanna be best, they're gonna
Be dissed if they don't get from in front of
All they can go get is me a glass of Moët
A hard time, sip your juice and watch a smooth poet
I take seven emcees put 'em in a line
And add seven more brothers who think they can rhyme
Well, it'll take seven more before I go for mine
Now that's twenty-one emcees ate up at the same time
Easy does it, do it easy, that's what I'm doing
No fessing, no messing around, no chewing
No robbing or buying, biting, why borrow?
This slob will stop trying, fighting to follow
My unusual style will confuse you a while
If I was water, I'd flow in the Nile
So many rhymes, you won't have time to go for yours
Just because of applause, I have to pause
Right after tonight is when I prepare
To catch another sucker duck emcee out there
'Cause my strategy has to be tragedy, catastrophe
And after this you'll call me your majesty
My melody"
Eminem	15	Amityville	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Verse 1]	"I get lifted and spin 'til I'm half-twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink, pencil me in for my last visit
Drink gin 'til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash, whiskey, and ash 'til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years
Mash with me again and imagine this"
50 Cent	19	High All the Time	Get Rich or Die Tryin’	2003	[Chorus]	"I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris'
Tanqueray or Alizé, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I stay high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)"
The Game	13	Dreams	The Documentary	2005	[Verse 1]	"I woke up out that coma 2001
'Bout the same time Dre dropped 
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: 
Rap critics politickin', wanna know the outcome
, , and  in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a
I had visions of makin' a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmakin' and rappin'
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
It's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back"

Eminem	15	As the World Turns	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Verse 2]	"We drive around in million-dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsidaz, and we suin' the courts
'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source (Yo)
Hypochondriac, hangin' out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy, fat, white-trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pail of garbage
It's almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park bitch
I met a slut and said, ""What up? It's nice to meet ya"" (Hi)
""I'd like to treat you to a Faygo and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck
And I don't get paid 'til the first of next month (Sorry)
But if you'd care to join me, I was about to roll this next blunt
But I ain't got no weed, no Phillies or no papers
Plus, I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So give me all your money and don't try nothin' funny
'Cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me""
I went to grab my gun, that's when her ass put it on me (Stop)
With an uppercut, hit me with a basket of laundry (Ooh)
I fell through the glass doors, started causin' a scene
Slid across the floor and flew right into a washin' machine
Jumped up with a broken back, thank God I was smokin' crack
All day, and doped up on coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her, but yo, I gotta catch her first
Ran through Rally's parkin' lot and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room
That's when I seen her bedroom door shut
""I know you're in there, bitch, I got my gun cocked
You might as well come out now""
She said, ""Come in, it's unlocked""
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked, watchin' gay porn
She said, ""Come here, big boy, let's get acquainted""
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg, ""No, please let go""
But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just tryna buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
Duh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh, go-go gadget dick
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground, caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted, ""Now, bitch, let's see who gets the best""
Stuffed that shit in, crooked and fucked that fat slut to death
Ow, ow (Come here, bitch)
Ow, ahh (Come here, take this mothafuckin' dick, bitch, come here)"

Nas	9	2nd Childhood	Stillmatic	2001	[Verse 2]	"Yo, dude is 31, livin' in his mom's crib
Ex-convict, was paroled there after his long bid
Cornrows in his hair, still slingin', got a crew
They break his mom's furniture, watchin' Comicview
Got babies by different ladies, high, smokin' L's
In the same spot he stood since '85, well
When his stash slow, he be crazy
Say he by his moms, hit her on her payday
Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared
They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds
So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years
Sittin' on different benches like it's musical chairs
All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night
With young dudes, it's them he wanna be like
It's sad but it's fun to him, right? He never grew up
31 and can't give his youth up, he's in his second childhood"
Eminem	15	Rap God	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 1]	"But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce"

Who want some? Don't come unprepared
I'll be there, but when I leave there
Better be a household name
Weatherman tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soakin' wet
In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
The 1-9-9-9 Anno Domini, anything goes
Be what you wanna be as long as you know
Consequences are given for livin'
The fence is too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell—hot!
Get a life, now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell
Look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm & Hammer
Soul-gold grill and a baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well not really, it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour
Hello, ghetto, let yo' brain breathe
Believe there's always mo', ow!"
50 Cent	19	Hate It or Love It	The Documentary	2005	[Verse 1]	"Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check, check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could"

He don’t want it with me, he in PC
I could have a nigga run up on him with a shank
For just a few pennies out my piggy bank
Yayo bring the condoms, I’m in Room 203
Freak bitch look like Kim before the surgery
It’s an emergency, for Michael Jackson see
Your picture and says she looks like me
Kelis said her milkshake bring all the boys to the yard then Nas went
And tattooed the bitch on his arm
I mean like way out in Cali niggas know you cuzz
First thing they say about you is you’s a sucker for love
This is chess not checkers, these are warning shots
After your next move I’ll give you what I got"

I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold for you, for four hours, and you just said, ""no""
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver? You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose

""Rappers get shot too much"" probably has a lot more precision
But that was the dеcision, and with that, I'ma stick

Ready to go at any moment, jumping like a pogo stick
Life never lived up to my expectations, so I accept the patience
Expect the worse, but now I'm pacin' back and forth
Inside, I'm melting like water on wicked witches
A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences
I had the best of life in my clenches, but monkey wrenches was thrown
Like chairs kings sit on, my prayers seem too long
I fall asleep before the ending, don't even get to say ""amen""
I hope He understands I be on bended knees
At times, I think I'm crazy, then I say ""forget it""
Or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and, like Riddick
Bowe, I've been fighting this since them fetus days
I count from one to twenty, when I'm through, repeat the phrase
""It's just a phase, it's gon' all pass"", but that gets old too

Heaven'll watch, God callin' from the hotlines
Why he keep givin' me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine?
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a spouse?
Somethin' in your blouse got me feelin' so aroused
What you about?
On that independent shit
Trade it all for a husband and some kids
You ever wonder what it all really mean?
You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?

Guru	20	Betrayal	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 1]	"Check the horror scene
The kid was like twelve or thirteen
Never had the chance like other kids to follow dreams
Watched his father catch two in the dome and to the spleen
Nothin' but blood everywhere, these streets are mean
They spared his life, but killed his moms and his sister Jean
Of course over some drug shit
His pops was on some ill-out, spill your guts, on some thug shit
Didn't know his boys was on some shady, no love shit
His pops got played out though, with silencers they laid him out yo
Took his stash and all the cash and left 'em, tied up on the couch yo
With tape over his mouth, so he couldn't cry out
Cause his dad was the nigga with clout
Survival of the fittest so they split his wig no doubt
Despite the stocking caps he noticed the same cat, who used to give him dough
And taught him, to use the same gat
Supposed to be like an Uncle, fam and all that
He could tell that it was him cause he had on the same slacks, he wore when
He took him to Meadowlands racetrack
Why did he flip and go out like that?
It's called betrayal"

You know why? Because so many are relatin' to this
Jealous is how they feel it intentionally
But they start to love it because I made it eventually
Pumpin' the music I keep the music like pumpin'
Cause Ren ain't in here for nothin', I keep the average crowd jumpin'
Yo, you know the color, the villain's in black
Always down to make noise, and attack
So you better get back unless you wanna come with it
And make your face like a target and close your eyes when I hit it
You're screamin' with fear but it's with fear that you're screamin'
You're wakin up in a sweat cause Ren is givin' bad dreams and
I'm not schemin', I'm just tellin the facts
That's how it is when N.W.A. starts to jack
So brothers that wanna scrap with me
That sweezin' and sneezin' will have to lap with me
Especially beggin' to write some lyrics with me
I just snatch your girl to take a nap with me
Cause when it comes to Ren there's no comparison
And if you try to be me, it's quite embarrassin'
But I understand cause you're mentally slow
Cause I can tell from the jump you're too nervous to go"

Eminem	15	Berzerk	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 2]	"Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, v-v-valve-valve
Ain't slowin' it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho"

The Game	13	Start From Scratch	The Documentary	2005	[Verse 2]	"Homey if I could rewind the hands of time
I would've cut off the PS2 at 12:49
Nigga I'm a gangster, I stay on my grind
Who knew 11 minutes later I'd get shot with my own 9
I was two beeps away from a flatline
When you a Bad Boy niggas don't wanna see you Shyne
Dre said it's my turn, he call it Game time
23 inch Lexani's, bitches call 'em LeBrons
I'd give my own life if I could change God's mind
Bring Baby Loony back at the drop of a dime
He let off a whole 'K, got shot one time
That was a cool nigga, I wish he had nine lives
My brother Jevon died cause he chased the cat
It's a dog eat dog world, Jesus please holler back
I got a confession to make, it's called payback
If you don't wanna listen, show me where Pastor Ma$e at"
Rakim	10	Uplift	The Master	1999	[Verse 2]	"Yo, what's this? Yo bust this. Yo it's time to uplift
They think all we do is bust clips and puff splifs
And plush whips and clutch chips and touch chicks
Flaunt rocks like Fort Knox and hawk blocks
Taunt cops with more props we want not
Panhandling with your mans and them
Scrambling, gambling, plans to win
While the cops clock 'em, fiends flock 'em
Women watch 'em, traders wanna top 'em
Ay yo what's the problem
Before the narcs knock em obviously playas plot to rob em
The ghetto got 'em, my man said it's rough at the bottom"

Rakim	10	It’s Been a Long Time	The 18th Letter	1997	[Verse 1]	"Follow procedures, the crowd couldn’t wait to see this
Nobody been this long-awaited since Jesus
Who wouldn't believe this? I heard the word on the street is
I'm still one of the deepest on the mic since Adidas
They said I changed the times from the rhymes that I thought of
So I made some more to put the New World in Order
With mathematics, put your status above the average
And help you rappers make paragraphs with graphics
'Cause new days is dawnin', new ways of performin'
Brainstormin', I write and watch the night turn to mornin'
On and on and, I got the whole world respondin'
Rock, I keep it hot, blow the spot without warnin'
The emperor well-known for inventin' a sentence full of adventure
Turnin' up the temperature, rush with adrenaline
How long has it been again to be in the state of mind that Rakim is in?"
50 Cent	19	High All the Time	Get Rich or Die Tryin’	2003	[Chorus]	"I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris'
Tanqueray or Alizé, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I stay high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit

I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)"
Eminem	15	Role Model	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Verse 2]	"Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must've been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco
(We did it) My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin' out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm 'bout as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel (That shovel)
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed the main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't tiltin' this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit, it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	Keep the Beat	Don’t Sweat the Technique	1992	[Verse 3]	"She wanted the extended version
So, I kept splurgin' and add more words in
Strong: the emotion, notions move, and
The poetry's smokin', potions soothin'
There goes the moon, I'm far from done
Rise like the sun, here comes the sun
And I won't stop 'til it sets, and then
Rewind the cassettes and I'ma play it again
But this time, it's instrumental at a faster tempo
All I wanna hear is ""Yeah, Rakim, go!""
I work overtime on your body and mind
'Cause I'm inclined to do both combined
My job is never done, but done well
Horizontal or parallel
Acapella as we start to speak
Heart to heart and cheek to cheek
Then I complete the beat"
Havoc	7	Drink Away the Pain (Situations)	The Infamous	1995	[Chorus]	"I think the whole world's goin' insane
I fill my brain with the Henny, and drink away the pain

I sip away on the liquor, and drink away the pain"
Big L	25	Flamboyant	The Big Picture	2000	[Verse 2]	"Yo, it's Corleone and Queen's Most, we bust 'til your whole team ghost
Everywhere we go, we must bring toast
Forever poppin' the chrome, always droppin' a poem
I can write it or recite it off the top of the dome
However you want it is how I'm gonna give it to you, Big L style
They brought it back to the streets ‘cause that shit sell now
So pal, back up a bit, give me some elbow space
I represent Harlem World, not Melrose Place
So I'ma lace the jewels up with nice baguettes
Flamboyant is the label that writes the checks
Y'all niggas better stop frontin' ‘cause I might get vexed
And I'ma run up on y'all and slice yours necks
With the machete, pockets heavy, slang more cane than Eddie
I represent uno-tres-nueve
Time is money, so I stay late
I'm quick to slide a playmate, bust off like a tre-eight then vacate"

All the guys would say she's mighty fine (mighty fine)

And the other half either got you
Cussed out or comin' up short
Yeah, now dig this, now even though (even though)
You'd need a golden calculator to divide (to divide)
The time it took to look inside and realize
That real guys go for real down to Mars girls, haha, yeah"
Lupe Fiasco	23	ON FAUX NEM	DRILL MUSIC IN ZION	2022	[Verse 3]	"I've admired many cities through the windows of hotels
From the window of a plane, I've seen the window of a cell
The plane started to fly, the rain started to fell
That's LaGuardia and Rikers, a airport next to a jail
I took a picture looked like my window was crying
'Cause it was sad that all they saw every day was somebody flying
And they was trapped, this shit is wack
But it was crack, hung it on my wall like a plaque
Keep your eyes on the prize and your thumbs on the apps
Facts, I wish that they was lying in they raps
How does that transpire
To be so damned by God, you want your friends to be goddamned liars?
All we talk about are our goddamned priors
Shiny metal boxes on top of goddamned tires
I'm goddamned tired
If I say I didn't indulge, my pants would be on goddamn fire
'Cause I'm a part of the problem
Sometimes the P-, sometimes the -roblem
Fame, all in the name of martyrdom (Yeah)
I wish that you were lying
What's the difference between a posthumous album
And a life insurance policy?

Oschino and Sparks and Freeweezy (Holla)
Mickey, Mallory, Chris, and Neef, hey
All I need is the love of my crew
The whole industry can hate me, I thugged my way through
And all I need is a chick that hold a jammy
Like Meth and Mary, like Marvin and Tammi, uh
Now understands we can't be stopped
From blowin' Swisher Sweets outta candy drops
Like we underground kings, ridin' dirty
A nigga been focused since I said hi to thirty (What up?)
Young niggas, y'all can't hurt me
Better watch and observe me
And learn how to earn better, I burn cheddar
I set fire to your empire
I blow smoke in your face, burn rubber off of rim tires

Scarface	11	Keep Me Down	The Fix	2002	[Verse 1]	"We made something from nothing
And vowed to never tear it apart
We turned the street hustle into an art
That would quickly change life forever for us
No more riding bikes or catching the bus
We on the roll up, money to fold up
With Cognac and cooked yola
Got the neighborhood about to blow up, but hold up
I see this van sittin', this old cat in a fitted
Trying to get your little homey tore up
Yo bruh, we ain't working on this corner take your ass on, dog
Before you make me feed your ass to my hogs you fucking faggot
I know you want to catch me with this bag so you can hide me
Or with my .44 so you can 45 me
You put this shit off in our neighborhoods and sweat us
And when you finally catch us up you give us letters
A cold thing
Just when a nigga reach his goal, mayne
You hand him a case for easing out the dope game
And I'm"

Niggas lip sync the lyrics 'cause they wanna be us
Groupie hoes from the hood, they be tryna G us

Girlfriend quit pretending, I'm the nigga ya love
And I ain't got to say nothing, you know that I'm thuggin'
Put my hands on that ass and ya say that I'm buggin'
We family, baby, kissin' cousins

For the cheese, my degrees is hotter than ya oven
I'm a New Yorker, but I sound Southern
And we sip DP 'til the Don stop bubblin'
After we play, okay, go to ya husband"

2Pac	18	If I Die 2Nite	Me Against The World	1995	[Verse 2]	"Polish your pistols, prepare for battle, pass the pump
When I get to poppin', niggas is droppin' then they done
Calling the coroner, come collect the fucking corpse
He got hit by a killer, preoccupied with being boss
Revenge is the method, whenever steppin', keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets, making crack sales
Picture perfection, pursuing paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Running with criminals individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me, my pistol posse's using deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name, a different game, ain't a thing changed
I'm seeing cemetery photos of my peers
Conversating like they still here; if I die tonight"
Rakim	10	It’s Been a Long Time	The 18th Letter	1997	[Verse 2]	"When I'm out proppin', either hangin' or shoppin'
People see me, stop and ask me when the album droppin'
The wait is over, in formation like a soldier
Like I told ya: greater, stronger, now that I'm older
I broke the code of silence with overloads of talents
My only challenge is not to explode in violence
I'm Asiatic and blazin' microphones a habit
At least once durin' the course of a day, it's automatic
In ghetto apparel, mind of a Egyptian pharaoh
Far from shallow, thoughts travel like an arrow
Allah's monotony, so far, they can't stop me
You know Ra' want property like Muammar Gaddafi
More thoughts than Bibles, recitals taught disciples
A sawed-off mic, so words scatter like a rifle
Thoughts that's trifle, I'm bustin' these for you
Ayy-yo, technical difficulties is through"

Nas	9	Shoot ’em Up	Nastradamus	1999	[Verse 1]	"One .44, two .45's
Three loaded clips, four niggas roll, one nigga drives
Five hundred Benz, six reasons why this kid should die
We shooting every mothafucka outside
Pulled on his block, jumped out the car
Guns in our hand, at the same time everybody ran
There that nigga go, hiding in the crowd
Let the trigger blow, seven shots now he lying on the ground
Blood on the floor then we shot some more
Niggas he was with two niggas hit, one nigga fell
One tried to run, go get him son
Make sure he's done 'fore we bail, I ain't tryna go to jail
Must handle beef, code of the street, load up the heat
If these nigga think they could fuck around
Real niggas do real things by all means
Niggas knowing how we get down, it goes"

In third person, I don't wanna see 'em
So I'm rehearsin' with my peoples how to G 'em
From a remote location in the BM
Scopin' the whole situation, like, ""Damn!""
Metamorphic, as the dope turns to cream
But one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean
It's difficult to read 'em
The windows to his soul were half closed, I put the key in
Pulled off slow, hopin' my people fleein'
Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in
Coppers was watchin' us through nighttime binoculars
This time they got us on tape, exchangin' dope for dollars
Make me wanna holler back at the crib in the sauna
Prayin' my people bailed out like Time Warner
Awaitin' a call, from his kin, not the coroner
Phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner
Beads of sweat, second thoughts on my mind
How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets?

Nowadays I don't sneak, you get killed bitch
And I don't give a fuck about your rep'
I got somethin' for your ass if you choose to step
One nigga from the Park comin' hard
Heh, sendin' motherfuckers to the morgue
Steady gettin' paid, pushin' powder
Cakin' motherfuckers sellin' flour
A brother like the Face ain't broke mayne
Hah, I started small time, dope game, cocaine
Just a reminder for those who forgot
A nigga got paid slangin' rocks
Bring on the magaziney people who ban, I won't duck 'em
They ain't never scared me before, so motherfuck 'em
You ain't never seen what I seen
Young niggas killin' people, and beatin' up the dopefiends
So if you wanna fuck with me, mayne
You better come prepared, 'cause I'ma let my nuts hang"

You small time, I ball with mine
Links, minks, Bentley Azure with mine
My jams bump out to the borderline
UK hot with it, blew spots with it
Every continent love when I spit it
Corners to blocks, even the cops feel it
Brothers on lockdown on their cot feel it
It's real in the field, the Last Mohican
Who survived in the streets and did something decent
Now I got plans to buy the whole hood
Legit now, I ain't gotta lie to no judge
I make hits now, money I flip now
Hood fella every honey wanna kiss now
I lit up my neck, pinkie, and wrist now
So girls everywhere, this is how we get down"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	The R	Follow the Leader	1988	[Verse 1]	"Whoever underestimated still waited
Pumpin' the radio, finally, they played it
You wondered how come the album was late?

You're just another rapper, who swears he's makin' records
That's what they said whenever I would walk by
I never tripped though, always kept my head up high
Eventually I knew that I would find my way
After the darkest night always comes a brighter day
And some would say, that turned away is all you'll get
I just said ""Bet!,"" and never let 'em see me sweat
'Cause in the end, I knew that I would have it all
While non-believers were prayin' for my downfall
And some would call and tell me that they wish me well
But in my heart, I'm knowin' that they wish me hell
Yo, get a real job, rappin' doesn't pay the rent
I hit the studio, 'cause that's where all my money went
Never surrender, it's all about the faith you've got
Don't ever stop, just push it 'til you hit the top
And if you drop, at least you know you gave your all
Be true to you, and that way you can never fall
But beware, these backstabbers ain't no joke
Just like a rope, they hang on you until you're broke
And when you're broke, they move onto the next dope
And there you are, can't even pay your car note
And when you reminisce, thinkin' how you got dissed
Remember how it felt and then remember this
Be true to you, believe that there's no one bigger
'Cause they can all suck dick, it's strictly for my niggas"

'Cause if it ain't ruff it ain't me
So who really cares how you want me to be
See, I'm just mean staying at the top of the pile
And doin' soft note tunes it ain't my style
And this concludes our program
Of how N.W.A. makes a ruthless jam
Now first we take an average drum
Give it to Dre, and the boy gets dumb
It's no secret, that I sit alone at night
Pick up a pad and pen and begin to write
All kinda lyrics that's promised to play
To make everybody say"

I'm in the city where the flag be gettin' thrown like it was pass interference
Padlock around the building
Crash, pullin' up in unmarked truck just to play freeze tag
With a bone to pick like it was sea bass
So when I made it out, I made about 50K from a show
Tryna show niggas the ropes before they hung from a rope
I'm prophetic, they only talk about it how I get it
Only good for saving face, seen the cosmetics
How many heads I gotta take to level my aesthetics?
Hurry up and get your muscle up, we out the plyometric
Nigga ran up out of luck soon as I upped the highest metric
The city just made it sweet, you could die, I bet it
They mouth get full of deceit, let these cowards tell it
Walk in New Orleans with the etiquette of LA, yellin'"

Before she end up like Superhead (Uh), givin' super head (Uh)
Every nigga in the industry done fucked Super Head

If I ever catch her slidin' or ridin' through the (Streets of Compton)
Rollin' down Green Leaf, smokin' on that green leaf
With a Mack 10 like I was born on Queens St
Murder MC's like I was born in Queensbridge

Eminem	15	Who Knew	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Verse 2]	"So who's bringin' the guns in this country? (Hm?)
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
And last week I seen this Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shootin' all sorts of these motherfuckers with a Uzi
I see these three little kids up in the front row
Screaming, ""Go!"" with their seventeen-year-old uncle
I'm like, guidance?! Ain't they got the same moms
And dads who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear?
What about the make-up you allow your twelve-year-old daughter to wear? (Hm?)
So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screamin' at him, fuckin' him up worse (Go sit the fuck down, you little fucking prick!)
And ""fuck"" was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flippin' the gym teacher the bird (Look!)
So read up 'bout how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch and changed school every three months
My life's like kind of what my wife's like (What?)
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin' ass every night: Ike
So how much easier would life be if nineteen
Million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?"

I can show you how I live in a lil' bit

Get to lickin' it, in a lil' bit"

Poppin they, little heads out they hole
Stickin they chest out, actin like they in control
But hold up, I've been doin' this since we was kids
And all you other niggas gotta ask if you could live
Your projects is on our dicks, you need to quit
And let us rep that for them, your raps ain't shit
Your background's incorrect, your song push no effect
On the people, don't try to play my part
Don't try to say my words that I lived and survived
Y'all niggas got some nerve, be careful at night
You might bump into a true to life nigga like P
Get beat over your head wit gun handles
Check the manual you went about it all wrong
We put you on the life, taught you how to drink right
And how to speak like a nigga livin' street life
How to chase down liquor wit more liquor
As a youth I was over proof, now I'm sober than your hoa
But still pound on a nigga 'til he throw up
Straighten up there's too much to lose
Get your head on right, we got the world to gain
And I'ma take mines while you sit around and complain
And I innovate raps while your song is playin'
Looks tastes and feels to me like no frills
Take that bullshit back to the two inch reel
Hit the studio hard, crash the track board like a smashed car
Then maybe next rhyme you could fuck with the God
P wit a capital ""P""
And don't ever in your life try to rock with me
On no days there's no rap page I can't top
I, splash the half ass trash you dropped
You get chopped in half, your little raff ain't last long
My shit came out and you got escorted to the door
You just a fuckin' clown here to entertain us all
I bring the gravity Dunn you're gonna fall
Anytime y'all niggas wanna mic brawl
Don't forget to me it's Bloodsport bring your dogs

Kendrick Lamar	16	XXX.	DAMN.	2017	[Verse]	"Hail Mary, Jesus, and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders, look what you taught us
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts, Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll ask again, oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
America's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does"

When I'm rollin' with my crew, watch what crooked niggas do
I got a nine millimeter Glock pistol
I'm ready to get with ya at the drop of a whistle
So make your move and act like you wanna flip
I fire thirteen shots and pop another clip
I bring luck, my Glock's like a fuckin' mop
The more I shot, the more motherfuckers dropped
And even cops got shot when they rolled up
Best to bring a knot or get popped, I'm a soldier
I ain't the type to fetch ya, ask Stretch, he's my witness
Smoke 'til I'm blitzed, fuck a motherfuckin' piss test
I'm trigger happy, try to 'tack me and I'll drop you quick
Long as I got a clip, I got some shit to hit 'em with
The nigga killer, I get iller when the shit gets thick
My brain flips, I start thinkin' like a lunatic
I rip shit, came equipped with a bigger crew
I thought these niggas knew, I'm a crooked nigga too"

I don't be around here, I ain't hip to the news
I don't know why that man clutchin' on that shit when you move
I don't know why that other rapper got stripped for his jewels
You know how easy it is to get shit confused
I wasn't even in New York, I was just in the cruise
Somewhere way out in the islands with your bitch in the cruise
Oops, my bitch in the cruise, dudes get hit when they snooze
Lose they hit from the Uz', ooze all over the street
I don't know why they said what's up, I don't know who's in that jeep
He talk about me all day but I ain't losin' no sleep"
MC Ren	17	Niggaz 4 Life	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Verse 3]	"Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Because police always wanna harass me
Every time that I'm rollin

Make me get face down in the street
And throw the shit out my car on the concrete
In front of a residence
A million white motherfuckers on my back like I shot the President"

Lupe Fiasco	23	Little Death	Tetsuo & Youth	2015	[Verse 3]	"So glad you're back
But not glad at that you're glatt
Where is the glamour in collapse?
Where in the shatter of the facts shoves one back to a pattern of stab wounds?
Swoon ridden goons consumed and driven mad soon
The atelier slowly fills with baboons
And other monkey business
Where killers go free cause the junkie's a funky witness
Runny mascaras from the cunning mask wearers of death
Bygone errors, sittin' like two oil derricks
Separated by a sea of cooling num nums
Reminiscing of an every day playing hum drum
Where recognition went unnoticed
And then solidified till it was stoic
We should've been poets
Somewhere between amateurs and grandmasters of iambic pentameter"
Jay-Z	12	Nigga What, Nigga Who (Originator ’99)	Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life	1999	[Verse 1]	"Motherfuckers wanna act loco

Faggots wanna talk to po-po's, smoke 'em like coco
Fuck rap, coke by the boatload
Fuck that, on the run-by, gun high, one eye closed
Left holes through some guy clothes
Stop your bullshit, Glock with the full clip
Motherfuckers better duck when the fool spit
One shot could make a nigga do a full flip
See the nigga layin' shocked when the fool hit
Oh, hey ma, how you? Know niggas wanna buy you
But see, me? I wanna fuck for free like Akinyele
Take this ride, make you feel it inside your belly
If it's tight, get the K-Y Jelly
All night, get you wide up inside the telly

As I spark my splif

We be shootin like free throws, flying them desert Eagles
Sell dope to the Po' while we eat chili Fritos
From a gang banger to a CEO
Everything I do is big like the nigga Ceaser-Leo
Won't stop till I'm dead
Ain't gotta watch for the Feds
They ain't watchin me so here's a dome shot to the head

And keep your head up, like the Lambo doors"""

Start off with the NyQuil, like, ""I think I'll just have a taste""
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium like, ""yeah, that's great""
I go to just take one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach 'cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak
And you'd think that with all I have at stake
Look at my daughter's face
""Mommy, something is wrong with dad I think
He's acting weird again, he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me

As they love my darkness, I make them heartless
And in return they have become my martyrs
I've been in the poem of many a poet
And I reside in the art of many a artist

My whole part in this, but they're fruitless in their harvest
The dro grows from my footsteps
I'm the one that they follow, I am the one that they march with

The Oval offices, crack houses, and apartments
Through the mazes of the queens
The pages of the sages and the chambers of the kings

One of the oldest, most ancientest things

The rape of Africa, the undying machine
The overpriced medicine, the murderous regime
The tough guy's front and the one behind the scenes

I'm its gym, and its math, and its history

I taught them aim for the head and hope they never come back
I'm glad your daddy's gone, baby, hope he never comes back
I hope he's with your mother with my hustlers high in my traps

I hope you die in his trash
I can't help it, all I hear when you crying is laughs
I'm sure somebody find you tied up in this bag
Behind the hospital, little baby crack addicts had

Then maybe you can grow up and be a stripper
A welfare-receiving prostitute and gold digger
You can watch on TV how they should properly depict you
The rivers shall flow with liquor, quench your thirst on my elixirs

I am the safe haven for the rebel runaway and the resistor
The trusted misleader, the number one defender
And from a throne of their bones I rule
These fools are my fuel, so I make them cool
(Let me put you on game)
Baptize them in the water out of Scarface pool
And feed them from the table that held Corleone's food
If you die, tell them that you played my game

Known to many others as ""Do or Die""
Malcolm X Boulevard and Gates Avenue
Smokin' up the fat trey bags with the crew
Me and the niggas Troy and Squeaky
Used to twist Dutch Masters, we got nice weekly
I used to build with the brothers by the spot
They had to hustle, but they still knew a lot
To get my haircut, had to go to Fort Greene
On Myrtle Ave. to get a fade with the sides clean
Then to Fulton just to look around
Just to roam around and find a chick to go uptown
And check a movie or some shit like that
I couldn't spend much, but yo, my game was fat
I remember this one chick, she brought me a beeper
Then one week later, she got me some sneakers
But then I stepped, 'cause I found out about her rep
And I ain't goin' out bein' no bitch's pet
But anyway I used to lay up in the crib
Listening to Red and Marley, wishin' I was on, kid
Saved my dough, stayed on the down low
Lounged and drank forties  with Tommy, Hill and Gusmoe
And Lil' Dap used to come by strapped
Nice off a L 'cause we stayed like that
Sometimes I used to miss my moms
Gunshots in the twilight, people fightin' every night
But I'ma be aight still
'Cause I'ma keep writin' shit and perfectin' my skills
I'm gonna make it, god damn it

Prodigy	8	Allustrious	Murda Muzik	1999	[Verse 4]	"Dunn these niggas is actresses
And they tryin' to play the man's role
Can't they see us wildin' out on the video?
Don't they see us in the club swingin' elbows?
Or on the street with our jewels on the cell phone?
Hoppin' the sidewalk with Benzes and Jeeps
I ran through more cars than it's sand on the beach
I'm pleased to meet you, now here's a word to the smart
Don't ever let your peoples boost up your heart
Cause you'll fuck around and get your ass torn apart
Challengin' the Mobb in the arts
Our literature stands colossal, compared to y'alls
Way ahead of your time, you're strugglin' to keep up
Your style's limited, your rap's primitive
Go 'head with that bullshit you kicked dunn"

JAY-Z	6	Caught Their Eyes	4:44	2017	[Verse 2]	"I sat down with Prince, eye to eye
He told me his wishes before he died
Now, Londell McMillan, he must be color blind
They only see green from them purple eyes
They eyes hide, they eyes high
My eyes wide shut to all the lies
These industry niggas, they always been fishy
But ain't no Biggie, no lazy eye, huh
This guy has ""Slave"" on his face
You think he wanted the masters with his masters?
You greedy bastards sold tickets to walk through his house
I'm surprised you ain't auction off the casket
Don't ""big bro"" me, don't ""Big Homie""
I've seen pure admiration become rivals
I've been to Paris at least two times
I've seen the Eiffel, I've seen a eyeful"

Dr. Dre	1	Express Yourself	Straight Outta Compton	1988	[Verse 1]	"I'm expressin' with my full capabilities
And now I'm livin' in correctional facilities
'Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist
I'm droppin' flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat, and that'll make you think
Some suckas just tickle me pink to my stomach
'Cause they don't flow like this one
You know what?
I won't hesitate to diss one or two before I'm through
So don't try to sing this
Some drop science, well, I'm droppin' English
Even if Yella makes it a cappella
I still express, yo, I don't smoke weed or sess
'Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage nothin'
But makin' a sucka and you equal, don't be another sequel"

Eminem	15	Without Me	The Eminem Show	2002	[Verse 2]	"Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?"
Common	22	Real People	Be	2005	[Verse 1]	"Real People walk in the streets, the streets is talkin'
Often it's beef this city never does
People walk and talk in they sleep
Cold sweats and wet dreams
On how to get green our faith is all in a jeep
Black souls raw and they deep
Hypes tryna talk with no teeth
Shorties sayin' ball or retreat
A lesson we all speak at one point or another
What you expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother
Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region
Through the pain wish they know that God was just teachin'
We want decent homes
So dreams we say out loud like speakerphones just to keep em on
It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on
I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong
Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn
Like the Bishop Magic Juan, that's why I write freedom songs
For the real people"
JAY-Z	6	Lucifer	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 1]	"Lord forgive him, he got them dark forces in him
But he also got a righteous cause for sinning
Them-a-murder me, so I gotta murder them first
Emergency, doctors performing procedures
Jesus, I ain't trying to be facetious, but
""Vengeance is mine"" sayeth the Lord, you said it better than all
Leave niggas on death's door, breathing on
Respirators for killing my best boy, haters
On permanent hiatus as I skate
In the Maybach Benz, flyer than Sanaa Lathan
Pumping ""Brown Sugar"" by D'Angelo
In Los Angeles, like an evangelist
I can introduce you to your maker
Bring you closer to nature, ashes after they cremate you bastards
Hope you been reading your psalms and chapters
Paying your tithe, being good Catholics, I'm coming"
Prodigy	8	Family	Nastradamus	1999	[Verse 3]	"Dirty fingernails, reaching in my pocket pulling knots out
I daydream of better days, in different ways
Out this lifestyle we live, iced-out with the big fifth
That's why the burnt leather lean to the left
Even though we gained cash on fish
I'm trapped on reason being we ain't all rich
And I'ma be that same nigga for the door
And I'ma still walk the same path, we soon clash
We get stacks, you do the math
We pound niggas out, walk away and laugh
Fresh from out the lab, P and Nastradamus, kid
Rap niggas shit they drawers"
Travis Scott	33	TIL FURTHER NOTICE	UTOPIA	2023	[Verse 3]	"You know the love was X-rated, it's how we made it
Drinkin' help balance the patience, watch how you take it
Can't keep no bitches, it's too dangerous, I been X-rated
Took everything up for the takin', I couldn't save it
See red and blues, I hit the pavement
Got low, got vacant
She needed angles, I need angels
I'm fightin' Satan
Leave me faded, I feel painless
I go out gracious
I'm tryna feel the shade of greatness by celebratin'
Bring entertainment, goin' brainless, like goin' dumb on my hiatus
She fall more in love every time that I tip
I fade away every time that I
Take a sip, I been goin' off the rip
I been bumpin' more Coldplay, the world cold as shit
I know one thing 'bout the old one, can have more fun with it
Knew exactly how to roll one and how to tote a stick
Even if she at the shows, so she never let 'em hit
Always knew she always on one and I can bare with it
Yeah, I can bare with it"
Eminem	15	Rap God	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 2]	"Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance

Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!

Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—"

Ride down Belfort one deep and bang Screw
And money makes the world go round, (that's right)
Money makes the world go round, (that's my life)
Livin' in a mansion one day with my wife
Stack me up some papers these days one night
If wind stops blowin' these days to my sight
The winds start flowin' I'm paid, trunk tight

Still, it's no excuse to abuse you
But no one knows what I'm goin' through, so I'd use you
To be truthful, I wouldn't know what to do if I lose you
So I refuse to, might have a screw loose and a fuse blew
But I think I might be buildin' up a tolerance to you
'Cause one minute I'm hollerin', ""Screw you""
Next, I take it back, guess you can say I'm tryna unscrew you
But the shit's about to pop off, yeah, I feel you up

Fuck no, you ain't seen it! It's the size of a peanut! (Huh?)
Speakin' of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach: twenty-one years old
After hangin' out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull (Blblblblblb)
His back starts to look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin' horizontal, barfin' (Bleh)
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
""Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!""
'Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting their money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin' yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels, class, 'cause it's bad for you"

And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a My Name Is
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigga who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where, and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (Argh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand, and I sit

Then again, me sheddin' tears don't help
Wanna call up to the President, and see if he know help
Let him know you up shit creek yourself, we all sinners
Facin' the winter, with no socks, and no shoes
In a position, where we all gon' loose
Instead of penitentiaries, we gon' need more schools
Or what the fuck is we gonna do?
Sit around and let the world pass us by?

And how we won't fall, how we goin' up
Or how we came up, or how we came up
It all started in the basement
Was an attic, but we called that shit the basement
Bass used to break all my mama vases
Unc' shot my first 8, then, nigga, I probably weren't eight then

Where many people learn to live with their handicaps
While others die
Where muthafuckas had no money spots
And if they did then they ass went insane
When all the money stops
I'm from the ghetto so I'm used to that
Look on your muthafuckin map and find Texas
And see where Houston at
Its on the borderline of hard times
And it's seldom that your hear niggas breakin' and givin' God time
That's why your ask my ma pray for me
Because I know that even I got to die
And he got a day for me
And every morning I wake up I'm kinda glad to be alive
Cause thousands of my homeboys died
And very few died of old age
In most cases the incident covered up the whole page
From Amsterdam to Amarillo
It ain't no secret
The world is a ghetto"

Workin' on myself, the counselin' is not easy
Don't you point a finger just to point a finger
'Cause critical thinkin' is a deal-breaker
Faith in one man is a ship sinking
Do yourself a favor and get a mirror that mirror grievance
Then point it at me so the reflection can mirror freedom
She told me that she need me the most, I didn't believe her
She even called me names on the post, the world can see it
Jokes and gaslightin'
Mad at me 'cause she didn't get my vote, she say I'm triflin'

Maybe it's time to break it off
Run away from the culture to follow my heart"

Nas	9	You’re Da Man	Stillmatic	2001	[Verse 2]	"Now wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
Was suicidal, high, smoking so much lye
I saw a dead bird flying through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings in Ghana stay
So I could get old, my flesh rot away
But that'll be the day when it's peace
When my gat don't need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death, indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimming in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help, why they love hurting me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N, the A to the S-I-R
If I wasn't, I must've been Escobar
.45 in my waist, staring at my reflection
In the mirror, sitting still in the chair like Mike Concepcion
When everything around me got cloudy
The chair became a king's throne, my destiny found me
It was clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to
And God, I'm so thankful"
Future	30	She Never Been to Pluto	Pluto x Baby Pluto	2020	[Verse 2]	"Might as well go outer space on these hoes
Might as well go outer space
Tell me when you ready, yeah
Tell me when you ready, yeah
Push the Rolls-Royce like a Chevy
And I got a horse like Billy Ray Cyrus
Bando to bando to bando
I'm havin' a seizure with the Draco, slidin' (Brrt)
Young 'dem came through and sprayed up the spot
You hear, ""Kaboom,"" on me, then you hear sirens
Runnin' the road like Boston, Georgia, Diego, I can't hide it (Freebandz)
Started out runnin' with the goonies, now I got no stylist, a nigga stylish
Should've put your bitch in the boonies where you can't find her, 'cause when we find her
I know I'm goin' bezerko, that's for-sure-ski, look at my shirt (For-sure-ski)
I know I'm goin' satin and silk Hermés on my curtains, yeah
Bustdown baguettes, put on my wrist and my chest, I'm getting so wet, hey
Comin' correct, you already know how niggas comin', the drum hold a fifth (Woo)
Turn up, yeah, gotta keep that track
Tell me when you're ready, yeah
Diamonds all baguetties, yeah
Got a bad-ass bitch, yeah
I just took her from a lame
Chopped her like hedges
I line that shit up like edges
I wrap the bill up like a presi'
I got my side bitch tryna go steady
I put these carats on my ring
Ain't tryna marry no bitch 'til I'm ready
Man, that pretty lil' shit, I done stabbed in it
Hit the dougie in it, then I dabbed in it
A stallion draped in medallion, but her Ferrari Italian
I'm out of here, all the way out of here
Baby Pluto all the way out of here
I'm stylin' you, baby, I'm stylin' you
Lacing you up in designer gear
I'm proud of you, nigga, you droppin' them bodies
You get you a Bird membership
A gang of niggas gon' go up when I go up
I can't forget 'em"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Purple Hearts	Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers	2022	[Chorus]	"Tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin', hmm
Rollin' sevens, I ain't bred for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talkin', but
Shut the fuck up when you hear love talkin'

Yeah, baby, yeah"
Eminem	15	Lose Yourself	8 Mile	2002	[Verse 2]	"His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah"
Daz Dillinger	2	Dogg Pound Gangstaz	Dogg Food	1995	[Verse 2]	"I got the right to serve your ass when you headin' to school
'Cause I'm Dat Nigga Daz, bitch, and I'm a fuckin' fool
Don't play with my head, nigga, killers don't speak
Come out the woodworks on your ass 
Then niggas start to streak 
Unmatched in my inner circle
Where only G's roam, hell hounds in the war zone
Not givin' a mad fuck 
About yo' clique, or what you representin' ain't meanin' shit
Bustas jump and get they fuckin' wig split
Caught up in the twist while I'm stickin' dick to your bitch
You don't know me 'cause I'm down to do low
Your bitch is jockin' Daz, I'm diggin' deep as Cousteau
Check it out
Nigga, the strap's in your hand, now what you gon' do?
Is you gon' blast me, and blast Kurupt, too?
Are you just gonna hold it and act like a bitch?
Where's he at? 'Cause I got me a gat
And I'mma show him how a true G's sposed to act with a strap
'Til I die, Dogg Pound for life
Show me a ho and I'll be fuckin' that bitch by midnight 
It ain't nuthin' nice, shakin' these niggas like dice
I told you once, so I ain't sayin' it twice
Dogg Pound Gangsta!!"

The Game	13	Don’t Worry	The Documentary	2005	[Verse 5]	"I'm locked up countin the days down
Tryna hold my head cause the penitentiary ain't no playground
I'm dyin in here and I don't know how you stay down
In the shootin range twice a week bustin that trey-pound
I would never ask you to wait around
But how do a white sandy beach in St. Tropez sound?
And no more outta town trips on that Greyhound
Just me hittin like a beat from Dr. Dre, out"
Kanye West	5	Heartless	808s & Heartbreak	2008	[Verse 1]	"How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely"
Guru	20	Skills	The Ownerz	2002	[Verse 1]	"It's the true and living with a youthful vengeance
And I'ma Judge Mathis your ass; give you a crucial sentence
You need at least twelve jewels to practice
You're too enthusiastic, male groupie bastard
Still trying to convince us some more
Pretending you're raw, that's what you'll need a minister for
Again it's the law, we got you up against the wall
We the gulliest, fuck it then, it's us against y'all
Mic skills, type grills, like I'm Michael Jill
Like when he rifle the pill is how I stifle the ill
Slide off, kid, and let a grown man finesse it
We bold and impressive, that old I manifest shit
Some new product from a known team
Niggas know me, and you can bet they know Preem
So here we go for your stereo
And you could tell that it's real when you hear me go…
Hear me go"
Jay-Z	12	Moment of Clarity	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 2]	"Music business hate me ‘cause the industry ain't make me
Hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music I be making
I dumb down for my audience and double my dollars
They criticize me for it, yet they all yell ""holla""
If skills sold, truth be told, I'd probably be lyrically Talib Kweli
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense
But I did 5 mill' – I ain't been rhyming like Common since
When your cents got that much in common
And you been hustling since your inception
Fuck perception! Go with what makes sense
Since I know what I'm up against
We as rappers must decide what's most important
And I can't help the poor if I'm one of them
So I got rich and gave back, to me that's the win-win
So next time you see the homie and his rims spin
Just know my mind is working just like them (Rims, that is)"
Havoc	7	Nighttime Vultures	Hell On Earth	1996	[Chorus]	"One time, son, you know we be the illest in this

Nah, I ain't gon' ride with you (nah not no more)
'Cause now I'm into big things (fuck y'all)
You know I can't do that shit no more (why?)
Now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't fuck with you (why?)
I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gon' stand on no corners (why's that?)

Lupe Fiasco	23	The Cool	Lupe Fiasco’s Food & Liquor	2006	[Verse 3]	"He begged for some change to get him on the train
""Damn, that nigga stank"" is what they complained
Tried to light the blunt, but it burst into flames
Caught the reflection in the window of what he became
A long look; wasn't shook, wasn't ashamed
Matter-fact, only thing on his brain was brains
Yeah, and gettin' back in his lane
Doin' his thing—first, he had to find somethin' to sling
Next stop was his block; it had the same cops
Walked right past the same spot where he was shot
Shocked that some lil' niggas tried to sell him rocks
It just felt weird, being on the opposite
They figured that he wasn't from there, so they pulled out
And robbed him with the same gun they shot him with
Put it to his head and said, ""You're scared, ain't you?""
He said, ""Hustler for death, no heaven for a gangster""
And..."
Future	30	Cinderella	WE DON’T TRUST YOU	2024	[Chorus]	"Racks on, racks stuck together
Sip red, talk to the devil

New paper stuck together
Bad bitch gon' fuck my bezel"
Common	22	Nag Champa (Afrodisiac for the World)	Like Water for Chocolate	2000	[Verse 1]	"Excite-ting, enlight-ning, invite-ing
I'm writing shit that I feel
Raps are black steel in the hour of commotion
The motion of Com is like that of a ocean
Devotion 'cause I'm the Earth, Wind, and Fire of hip-hop
By Rakim and Short, I've been inspired
My shit knocks environ...ments of cats with seventeen's
Tint, time is money, the mind is funny, how it's spent on getting it
I'm sitting with descendants of Abraham
Who say the jam is ""money, cash, hoes""
I went from bashful to asshole to international, lover of self
Word to the mother on my last record cover, it's felt
Now deal with it"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst	good kid, m.A.A.d city	2012	[Verse 1]	"I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!""
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— "
Nas	9	Big Girl	Nastradamus	1999	[Verse 2]	"Got your name and your number in my cell phone
Hear your voice and I wonder where you are, if you all alone
If you in a good mood, if you not
Or you thinking bout you was at my spot
What we did when we got hot
Is you dreaming you had me?
Is you creaming your panties?
Like a king, fed me grapes, and you fanned me
On the couch, to the floor, to the bed, to the sink
And we ate each other like candy
Under the covers, two intimate lovers
You fuck a nigga like you mad at me
Throw the ass to me
You should be glad to be
In the presence of a real thug as bad as me
While I'm in the streets with my murdering squad
You talking to your friends that I'm hurting it hard
How I'm making my rod, how I make you say ""Oh God""
Every ho that you know wanna know Nas
Gotta dodge all the blowjobs, getting hard
'Cause you know how these girls are
Wearing tight shit, no panties, no bra
Running up to my car with menage a trois suggestions
Starting to get an erection
Guessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing
Complexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave
I need time to breathe
Wanna follow me, ironically
You pop up, throwing bottles at my Tahoe
Like it's my fault
But you don't wanna talk
Don't wanna hear nothing, all of a sudden
You and the shorty start scuffing
Now shorty dumping you out
Can't let her get the best of you
So I rescue you
Only thing left to do was to grab her
So you can jab her, get a cheap shot
You don't wanna feel chumped
Now here the cops come
So we gotta run to the ride
Then we drive off through the traffic
Don't panic, but you know how we gotta manage
Looking at your face
And the damage in your facial
Every angle can't let it faze you
No reason to be insecure or immature
Baby girl, see the world is yours"
50 Cent	19	Just a Lil Bit	The Massacre	2005	[Verse 1]	"I step up in the club, I'm like, ""Who you with?""
G-Unit in the house, yeah, that's my clique
Yeah, I'm young, but a nigga from the old school
On the dancefloor a nigga doin' old moves
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
I hit your ass up, boy, I don' warned you
Better listen when I talk, nigga don't trip
Your heat in the car, mine's in this bitch
I ain't tryna beef, I'm tryna get my drink on
And my diamonds, my fitted, and my mink on
I'ma kick it at the bar 'til it's time to go
Then I'ma get in shawty ear and I'ma let her know"

Cause on the real, dog you the hardest nigga we know
I'm shakin' 'em off, breakin' 'em off
Shot him in his face and now they takin him off
Here's a shoutout to those with a plot out
Fool we should have got out, now you gettin popped out
I'm not out to diss but to get my chips
And smash, pass with cash

Can I borrow a dollar?
No, but you can eat this dick
While I smash my shit and uh poppin my collar
Can I give you my number?
Yea, next summer
But I'm hungry baby
Sh, me too, that's crazy
So open up the door cuz I'm ready to go
Aight then, but I ain't got no money

Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fuckin' up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really, really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship

All by myself with the world on my delts
We can chill while it melts, the beat bill feel like it's felt
My suspicion Christians killed all the Celts
What else? What elsе? Forget what happened in thе past
You gotta let it go like what happened to the gas
Can't have such anathema inside a mass
It'll ruin your communion and soil all of your fast
Stay away from rebels worshipping the devil like jazz
When Heaven loses a job, Hell wins staff
Looking over macroeconomic math
Counting, weighting, and calculating how much time that we have
Then put it all in a graph, look at all of the paths
But look at Instagram then go back and split it in half
I ain't rapping, what's happened is blowing glass
Trakk is tapping drums and Crystal's blowing the brass
Per the usual
All that beautiful musical moving you like a inter-cooled Subaru
With an Italian man saying, ""Look at what I do for you""
A nice Chicken Vesuvio
Be in North Boston often
'Round them Sicilians I be walking like the ambiance and talking
My favorite part is when all of the affogatos is brought in
You can put Dolce vita chicken risotto in my coffin
It's a—, ayy"

Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feel, some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem

That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me"

Unanswered questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin'
Crooked thoughts laced with weed, learnin'
Duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'
Inhale the sherm smoke, visualize the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to diss us
Takin' pictures for the feds in desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us all, give us plenty centuries
Forgive my sins, since I entered many penitentiaries
The best revenge is ""Fuck friends!"" – we military minded soldiers
Bustin' shots blindly, tryin' to find Jehovah
To help me, somebody save me, lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
Embrace my words, make the world change
And still I smile, nigga"

My consciousness was Michael's common sense
I missed the karma that came as a consequence
Niggas bustin' off through the curtains 'cause she hurtin'
Kay losin' the babies 'cause their future's uncertain
Nobody wins when the family feuds
We all screwed 'cause we never had the tools
I'm tryna fix you
I'm tryna get these niggas with no stripes to be official
Y'all think small, I think Biggie
Y'all whole pass is in danger, ten Mississippi
Al Sharpton in the mirror takin' selfies
How is him or Pill Cosby s'posed to help me?
Old niggas never accepted me
New niggas is the reason I stopped drinkin' Dos Equis
We all lose when the family feuds
What's better than one billionaire? Two"

Niggas I used to hang with wants to act like they don't know me
Come and listen to my story, I gots a lot of shit up on my mind
I wipe the boo-boo from my brain, then I finish up my rhyme
Take a number, I caught you in a slumber
I hit you for a lick, I'm in the slammer for the summer
But now it is the fall, I'm havin' a ball, makin' my nickel sacks crawl
'Til my niggas got to servin' when they beep and when they call
I got the Peter, Paul, and plus that Mary Jane
I'm rollin' reefer out of a Regal, how could I refrain
From bein' rough, from bein' tough, from bein' dangerous?
I'm hangin' with the P.A. niggas, ain't no changin' us
See, you can try, if you try, if you don't, you don't
If you wanna battle, it's either that you will or you won't
See, that rap shit is really just like sellin' smoke
If you got some fire shit, your niggas gonna always toke
Dope is not what I be slingin' on this track
Niggas don't comprehend that it be deeper than Cadillacs
You know that, right? You bite, you fucked up
You won't be gettin' away this time, I'm real as hell, so what's up?
I rip shit with pimp shit, I'm slingin' it from the South
Talk bad about the A-town, I'll bust you in your fuckin' mouth
Fuckin' true that, so true that
Smoke one, yeah"
Eminem	15	Marsh	Music to Be Murdered By	2020	[Verse 2]	"I could keep beefin', fuck is the point?
I could make it really difficult for motherfuckers to come to Detroit
If you're still looking for smoke, I already gave you an L
I'd rather just see you in Hell, but I should get Puff on the joint (Diddy)
Wait, run it back, I said give you an L, inhale
Puff on the joint, I am the blunt you avoid
Used to get jumped for my ProWings
When I was growing up they said a Slinky's a wonderful toy
My mother thought I was such a fun little boy
""Oh, what a bundle of joy""
Until the morning she suffered a punch in the groin
From a tantrum I was throwing
Like a motherfuckin' disgruntled employee
I don't cut the beat 'til I fuckin' destroy it
Once I get going, rain, thunder, it's storming
Puddles are forming, I hear somebody's voice
In my head, say it's still a dream
Then he said kill emcees
Trippie Redd, with pills and lean
Sipping meds in the limousine
Getting head, guillotine"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Swimming Pools (Drank)	good kid, m.A.A.d city	2012	[Chorus]	"Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it"

You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all"
Eminem	15	Eminem - My Mom (ترجمه فارسی)	Relapse	2009	[Chorus]	"My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs

برای همین جوریم که هستم چون من شبیه اش ام
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs

برای همین اینو کشیدم که کشیدم چون من مامانم ام!"
Eminem	15	Still Don’t Give a Fuck	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Verse 3]	"I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spent a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit)
Now, how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I can't rap anymore, I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique, I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me
From the second I was born, my momma lost me
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this Earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say?
Brain damage? Fuck, I was born durin' an earthquake"
Common	22	Geto Heaven Part Two	Like Water for Chocolate	2000	[Verse 1]	"Searching for a love, throughout the ghetto
Young girls is thick, righteousness is narrow
I got my third eye on the sparrow
Want my peoples straight and to rock sweet apparel
The mother of my child, we're not together
Baby, it's your back, I got forever
As the weather, talks to us
Henrock and the Holy Spirit walks through us
The blunted eyes of the youth search for a guide
A thug is a lost man in disguise
The rise and fall
Of a nation, even when the buildings tumble, I still stand tall
I walk through the valley with a life preserver
Feeling at times, that I might just murder
Yo, but that ain't what I was sent for
I want folks to say his life it meant more
Than any car, any rock or any broad
He found Geto Heaven in himself and God"
Kanye West	5	Flashing Lights	Graduation	2007	[Verse 2]	"I know it's been a while, sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doin' my thing
I know I was foul, baby
A-bay, lately, you've been all on my brain
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Frontin' though, yo, I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'll go get this difficult
Feelin' like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just sayin', ""Hey, Mona Lisa
Come home, you know you can't roam without Caesar"""
The Game	13	Camera Phone	LAX	2008	[Verse 1]	"Picture me and my gangsta girl, riding with the top back
Bangin Ne-Yo, my neck frío, my Sox hat
Tilted to the side like you know I get my grind on
Get my shine on, jewelry black in all rhinestones
Rims spinning like a globe, on these low pros
Do it big cause I'm supposed to floss
And that's the reason she break me off
'Cause I'm gangsta
And I'm ridin wit "
Lupe Fiasco	23	Hurt Me Soul	Lupe Fiasco’s Food & Liquor	2006	[Verse 2]	"I had to ghetto boy bop, a Jay-Z boycott
'Cause he said that he never prayed to God, he prayed to Gotti
I'm thinking, ""Golly, God, guard me from the ungodly""
But by my thirtieth watching of Streets is Watching
I was back to giving props again, and that was bothering
'Bout as uncomfortable as a Untouchable touching you
The theme songs that niggas hustled to seemed wrong
But these songs was coming true
And it was all becoming cool (Cool)
I found a condom on the ground that johns would cum into
And thought: ""What constitutes a prostitute is the pursuit of profit
Then, they drop it
The homie in a suit pat her on the butt, then rock it
It seems I was seeing the same scene adopted
Prevalent in different things with the witnesses indifferent to stop it
They said, ""Don't knock it, mind your business""
His business isn't mindin' that nigga pimpin'—got it"
The Game	13	New York, New York	The Documentary 2	2015	[Outro]	"This song is dedicated to Stephanie Mosley, who was murdered from a single gunshot wound inflicted by her husband, Earl Hayes, in Los Angeles, California; December 18th, 2014
I knew Hayes since we were both signed to Aftermath back in 2005
And if I can keep it 8 more than 92 with you, he was a good nigga
I never saw that coming
My prayers are with Stephanie's entire family
I am truly and deeply sorry for your loss"

I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
(Huh, yup)
Am I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)
When I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
With a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)
'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)
And by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had"

Reppin T. Squad since birth 'til I retire
I wire your jaw, wire the walls with plastique explosives
And riot the halls at the malls where all the crackers moms live
Keep flappin yo' gibs and I'mma come back with those kids
From the back of the bridge
I think two hand touch means tackle the bitch
I rap for the chips, but I'm truly assassin
Four hundred pounds, six feet tall, brutally handsome
That's the pro, got beef with Pun, you gots to go
Mafia style, tear you a new ass-a-hole
Flash your dough, but you too cool for the captain

And to the 50 Cent rapper, very funny, get your nut off

Move that crowd, direct with steel
For a medicine when niggas act ill

Be easy the way that you approach me
Didn't see it coming, but he got his plug pulled

They leave, when that nigga blow, she the first bitch on her knees
Knowin' dudes that's neglectin' they seeds
Instead of takin' care of 'em, they spendin' money on trees
I pray for you deadbeat daddies 'cause when them kids get grown
It's too late for you, now you old and you gettin' shitted on

Kendrick Lamar	16	Purple Hearts	Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers	2022	[Chorus]	"Tippy-toeing and I'm mud-walkin', hmm
Rollin' sevens, I ain't bred for no coffin
I know y'all love it when the drugs talkin', but

Fell out of love, I delete all the nudes out your phone
Can't get a reaction out of me, that's what you want
It's not sexy to show your vulnerability, keep it calm
Had her eatin' sushi out my palm
Got a new penthouse, sittin' at the palms
Got a flock of birds wrapped around my arms
Tried to park the Bugatti in the lobby
Went to Puerto Rico, went to Bali
Got her body done just for a hobby (I did)
Got her skatin' on new ice like it's hockey (Pluto)
Made her throw away all the Versace

Kendrick Lamar	16	Mortal Man	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 3]	"I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you
That's not Nelson-like—want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben's Island analysing; that's where his cell is
So I could find clarity—like, how much you cherish me?
Is this relationship a fake, or real as the heavens be?
See, I got to question it all; family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow, Murphy's Law
Generation X—will I ever be your ex?
Flaws of a baby step', mauled by the mouth of Pit bulls
Put me under stress, crawled under rocks, duckin' y'all
It's respect—but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left 'em for dead?
Is it Moses? Is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther? JFK? Shooter—you assassin
Is it Jackie? Is it Jesse? Oh, I know it's Michael Jackson—oh"

Y'all be calling it hip-hop, I be calling it hypnotize
Yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body, but freed my mind
What the fuck are you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war
My details be retail, man, I got so much in store
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that, nigga, look at that line, it's so diverse
They gettin' off work and they wanna see Kendrick
Everybody can't drive Benzes, and I been there, so I make it my business
To give 'em my full attention, ten-hut, man, I gotta get my wind up
Man, I gotta get down with God 'cause I got my sins up, ooh
Matter fact, don't mistake me for no fuckin' rapper
They sit backstage and hide behind them fuckin' cameras
I mosh pit, had a microphone and I tossed it
Had a brain, then I lost it
I'm out of my mind, so don't you mind how much the cost is
Penny for my thoughts, everybody, please hold up your wallets
Yeah, man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell, man?
Gone postal, never freeze up when I approach you
That's starstruck and roast you, oh my

I believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro
If the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho
Brother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation
He sat back and smiled
Black on black lies is worse than black on black crime
The Jews share their truth on how to make a dime
Most black men couldn't balance a checkbook
But buy a new car, talkin' 'bout, ""How my neck look?""
Well, it all looks great
Four hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains
The light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard
Real family stick together and see through the mirage
The smokescreens, perceptions of false reality
Who the real owner if your boss gets a salary?
I am one with the people
I am one with the people (Real!)
I've been woken from enlightened man's dream
Checkin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem
Let me not say too much or do too much
'Cause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch
I'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen
So the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'
God, I have humbled myself before the court
Drop my ego when confidence was my last resort
I know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I turned on the news and they was buryin' me
One set of footsteps, You was carryin' me
When I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me
Told Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see
I would've took a hundred million and gave twenty to Hov
I heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove
But it's better that I stayed at home with my folks
'Cause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke
Only thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go
We all go
Not just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo
She got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo
Modern-day MJ, with a off-the-wall flow"
Big Boi	26	Ms. Jackson	Stankonia	2000	[Verse 1]	"My baby a drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She need to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story, we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah"
Gang Starr	21	Moment of Truth	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 1]	"The same sheisty cats that you hang with and do your thang with
Could set you up and wet you up nigga, peep the language
It's universal, you play with fire it may hurt you
Or burn you, lessons are blessings you should learn through
Let's face facts, although MC's lace tracks
It doesn't mean behind the scenes there ain't no dirt to trace back
That goes for all of us, there ain't nobody to trust
It's like sabotage, it's got me ready to bust
But I can't jeopardize what I have done up to this point
So I'ma get more guys to help me run the whole joint
Cultivate, multiply, motivate or else we'll die
You know I be the master of the who, what, where and why
See when you're shinin', some chumps'll wanna dull ya
Always selfish, jealous punks will wanna pull ya
Down, just like some shellfish in a bucket
'Cause they love it to see your ass squirm like a worm
But just as you'll receive what is comin' to you
Everybody else is gonna get theirs too
I ain't no saint, therefore I cannot dispute
That everyone must meet their moment of truth"

Jay-Z	12	D’Evils	Reasonable Doubt	1996	[Verse 1]	"This shit is wicked on these mean streets
None of my friends speak, we're all tryna win
But then again, maybe it's for the best though
'Cause when they're seein' too much
You know they're tryna get you touched
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out
Couldn't understand the mechanics
And the workings of the underworld, granted
Nine-to-five is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot
Life ills poisoned my body, I used to say fuck mic skills
I never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti
That's right, it's wicked – that's life, I live it
Ain't askin' for forgiveness for my sins, ends
I break bread with the late heads
Pickin' their brains for angles on all the evils that the game'll do
It gets dangerous, money and power is changin' us
And now we're lethal, infected with D'evils"
Dr. Dre	1	Just Dippin’	No Limit Top Dogg	1999	[Verse 2]	"Uh, actin' a fool, nigga done paid his dues
And got my receipt in return, so I recline the leather seats
With a trunk full of beats and
Chronic filled leafs to burn
No concern as I make a left turn on the 'Shaw ('sup nigga)
Off of Jefferson, feelin' awfully naked at the U-turn
Shit, left my gun, that's a no-no
Fuck Bernard Parks, I'm my own po'-po'
Nigga talkin' dirty after dark, startin' stuff (what's up nigga)
May have to mark up a nigga FUBU logo
Lettin off like a Ruger promo
And even though I'm about the hoes, I never doubt the dulos
You know the rule goes, where there's a ho there's a hater
(Fuck them niggas) Well there's some hoes over there
And I concentrate on the haters later (what)
Give these bitches numbers to the pager
Invite 'em to the next Dre function as party favors
Who said pimpin's hard labor?"

Snoop Dogg is the name, Dogg Pound's the gang
If it ain't one thing, it's a motherfuckin' 'nother
Word to my granny and my daddy and my mother
Whether standin' on the corner or bouncin' in the six-deuce
When I was locked up, I couldn't wait to get loose
'Cause back in the days, on the side where it's at
A nigga had to have a fat stack
And I was a fool
Don't make me have to grab my strap and go rat-tat-tat-tat
Nigga, slap to a motherfucker face, he fall

Grow up, girl, instead, you want revenge so now you act the nicest
To who'sever getting down and trife-est
To get his mind, all you do is give him something priceless
'Cause in time, he'll realize the thighs is all he needs
More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed
There you go again, starting wars, making me more yours
Seem to get a kick out of keeping me on all fours
Face glistening, I'm addicted to you
Original Wisdom Body got me picturing you
Igloos of ice, tricking on you
You never listen to this nigga spending Franklins on tennis anklets
Must've had a bad deal in the past, though
Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow
Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain
You got a job part-time, and school's your night thing
With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now
You getting interviewed, but your boss is into getting screwed
Typical day that the black girl sees
Coming home, wanting more from a college degree, uh"

Kanye West	5	Jesus Walks	The College Dropout	2004	[Verse 1]	"You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless (Niggas) might snatch your necklace

Somebody tell these (Niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor, the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
Try to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' ""We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast""
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us

Eminem	15	The Way I Am	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Verse 1]	"I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag of this weed
It gives me the shit needed to be the most meanest MC on this—
On this Earth, and since birth, I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently
Off of this chest, and I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
Do not come and speak to me
I don't know you, and, no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty
No patience is in me, and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me, just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom, and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you
I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me"
Future	30	Rockstar Chainz	Pluto x Baby Pluto	2020	[Verse 2]	"Started with a million dollars, go 'head and get me billi'
I'm from the trenches, so the clip least hold a fifty
Crushed ice, Cartier frames, or Chrome Hearts
Niggas ain't solid as they claim, so I play it smart
I'm changin' weather, I'm thinkin' better, I'm peepin' the energy
I left my heart in the streets, so ain't no sympathy
If you ain't with me, you against me, you the enemy
Playin' my cards, sittin' in the stars, this the life I lead
Coolest thing you could do is squash the beef and still send a hit
I know niggas'd do it to me, so I ain't gon' never stop a blitz
She say it's loyalty, no betrayal when it come to me
I know what really turn you on and I'ma keep a secret"
Eminem	15	Farewell	Music to Be Murdered By	2020	[Verse 3]	"This relationship is all that it's cracked up to be
Never lack lust in that 'cause we act nuts

Trick you with a back rub
Tell you to relax then dump your ass in the bathtub (Haha)
Yeah, now that's love, may sound pathetic
But fuck the world 'cause they out to get us
I love you but I won't exchange vows
Hey now, don't get carried away
No way I'll get married, it'll take a rain cloud to wed us
Yeah, but we're so insane ‘bout each other
May take the same route and way out as Junior Seau
Break out Berettas, lay down in bed and blow our brains out together
Who knows how it's gonna play out?
Or whether death's what our ending will be
One of us shot in the back while attempting to flee
But I'll go to bat for you, defending your honor
Yeah, no contingency fees, something we’re not, nah
We're not pretending to beef, don't cost a penny to be with me
Time we're spending is free, we could be broke as a joke
Won't make a difference to me, don't have to give me a thing
Could've been a 50 cent ring from out of a vending machine
Love unconditionally, there's no other fish in the sea
Guess I'm a prisoner, see, addiction is a disease"
Big Pun	24	I’m Not a Player	Capital Punishment	1997	[Verse 3]	"Some chick in back of me, bought me a daiquiri
Told me meet her in back of Zachary's 'cause she heard I was packin' meat
I bagged the freak and hit the telly
Got the Phillies, lifted her belly and ""Put it in Her Mouth,"" like Akinyele
Far from ugly but they used to say I'm too chubby
But since the money the honeys got nothin' but love for me
So rub my tummy and make a wish, I'll make you rich
Take your kids to the flicks, come back and fix your favorite dish
(Not!) You crazy bitch, I ain't with that, I'ma hit that
Split back to the shack where my other chicks at
Now can you dig that? I'm the mack, doin' my thing
Pullin' your strings, makin' you feel like you in a dream
It's the king of the Hip-Hop Quotables, givin' you multiples
Just by the tone of my voice in the vocal booth
I notice you doin' your thing with your crew
Is it aight if I come down there and sing to you?"

Got you curious for thug passion, now picture that
Tongue-kissing, hand full of hair, look in my eyes
Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise
Me and you moving in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweating up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespecting when I tongue-kiss your neck
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect?
Late night, hit the highway, drop the top
I pull over, getting busy in the parking lot
And don't you love it how I lick your hips and glide?
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside
Got you lost in a love zone, stuck in the lust
I got the bedroom shaking, back-breaking
When we're tossing it up"

Surprise a town, the place it's live and loud
We vibin' now, I go wild and dive in the crowd
Never hit the ground, they catch me and carry me around
Then put me right back on stage to shut it down
From New York to Cali, Japan and I-taly

Civilians and little children is especially harmed
Camoflauged Torahs, Bibles, and glorious Qurans
The books that take you to heaven and let you meet the Lord there
Have become misinterpretated reasons for warfare
Reread them with blind eyes, I guarantee you there's more there
Rich must be blind 'cause they ain't see the poor there, yeah

Jay-Z	12	Never Let Me Down	The College Dropout	2004	[Verse 1]	"Yo, first, I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
First, I had they ear, now I have they heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot, I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'ma be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God-given
This is hard-livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga, I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy"
Scarface	11	Smile	The Untouchable	1997	[Verse 2]	"Now, as I open up my story, with the blaze of your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly, up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone, but I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
Overlookin' his tomorrows, and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories, and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine
Too many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
Over football chose to cook raw, wouldn't take but I did
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile; smile!"

We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blown

Then I'll get the lotion, and do somethin' to me, when your thighs is exposed
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose

Creepin' in a stolen jaloppy out there waitin' on you

The Glocks in the box and the nine on tuck
The bulletproof glass, the 40 in the stash
I pull the steering wheel and it pop on up
Man... (Die)
We finna go up in this club, show a little love
Get a few drinks, holler at some girls
Snatch up a pair, leave outta there
Put some dro' in the air, then go and get some grub

This the third time them niggas done circled the block
It's money down now, yeah, but damn it's hot
They'll love to catch a nigga, on a direct sale
They say, ""tell us who caught the body, or you goin' to jail""
Look, if you know the drill you stay the fuck outta dodge
And say what's happenin' to the captain
And what's up to the sarge
Fuck bein' in a cage man, that shit for the birds
Charlie drunk, drinkin' wild irish rose on the curb
I know a spot full of niggas tryin' to bet a few bucks
Hopin' they number come out, they can have 'em some luck
Two Ace to the deuce, and stumbled off mad
Lost his re-up money man, that's all he had
Magazine from the store, so he can look at the cars
And do pull ups in the park, on the monkey bars
Mad as fuck"

Nas	9	God Love Us	Nastradamus	1999	[Verse 3]	"Jealousy in the hood, felonies in the hood
Thugs with guns become celebrities in the hood
Yo, it's beef in the hood, smoke trees in the hood
Little girls have seeds by OGs in the hood
It's food in the hood, it's drugs in the hood
You can choose if you would, coke to sniff
Dope to ooze in your blood, parolees
Ex-cons live in the hood, it's jobs in the hood
You can starve in the hood
Your best friends'll fuck your baby moms in the hood, but it's good in the hood
I was raised in the hood
Was taught how to walk and duck strays in the hood, I stays in the hood
Got my ways from the hood
Learned to play ball, go to the NBA in the hood, there's AIDS (uh) in the hood (WHAT?)
Our lives are the worst, on top of that, we broke
That's the main reason why God love us the most"

You would give that pussy up to a lame, won't you?
Like an old school, I re-did the frame on you
I got my old shooters with me and they land on you
Word to them niggas out the six
A whole lotta lean my nutrition
They should've told ya I had the drank on me
They should've told ya I brung a bank with me
They should've told ya I keep that molly on me
They should've told ya I got that stick with me

My niggas unemployed sellin' Popeyes"
Gang Starr	21	You Know My Steez	Moment of Truth	1997	[Verse 2]	"The beat is sinister, Premo makes you relax
I'm like the minister, when I be lacin' the wax
I be bringin' salvation through the way that I rap
And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that
Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power
When the mic's within my reach, I'm feelin' more power
Stealin' at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
It's often easier for one to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines take flight
The apparatus gets blessed, and suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure, I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreadin' like the plague
MC's lucked up and got paid
But still can't make the fuckin' grade
How many times are wannabes gonna lie?
Yo, they must wanna fry
They can't touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness carryin' my torch
The illest soldier, when I'm holdin' down the fort
You know my steez
(You know my steez)"

He did some shit he shouldn't have did, so we ridin' for that
And that nigga that was down for me, rest the dead
Switched sides, guess his new friends wanted him dead
Probably be murdered for the shit that I said
I bring the real, be a legend, breathin' or dead
Lord, listen to me, God don't like ugly, it was written
Ayo Nas, your whole damn style is bitten (You sound like Rakim, man)
You heard my melody, read about my life in the papers
All my run-ins with authorities, felonious capers
Now you wanna live my life, so what's a ""chazzer,"" Nas?
Niggas that don't rhyme right, you've seen too many movies
Load 'em up against the wall, close his eyes
Since you lie you die — goodbye!
Let the real live niggas hear the truth from me
What would you do if you was me? Nigga
Against all odds"

That crazy-ass nigga's back in the motherfuckin' hizzouse
The notorious Compton G
D-R-E on the solo tip, fuck them other fools
What up, Ren?
Yeah, droppin' Chronic flakes on your ass, biatch
West Coast flavor
Niggas who talk shit get dealt with real quick
So if you wanna take a trip to the Row

Protected by niggas with big dicks, AK's, and one-eight-seven skills
So if it's must you test us, we can handle it the streets, nigga, fuck makin' records

Oh, yeah, PS, fuck Mr. Roarke and Tattoo, AKA Jerry and Eazy
Sincerely yours, these motherfuckin' nuts
I don't love Eazy, I don't love Jerry
I don't love Ruthless Records
Frankly, I don't love nothin' they got to do with
But, but, but you know what I want them to do for me?
Jerry, Eazy, check this shit right here
I want y'all to put these bizzalls in your jizzaws
And work them like a strizzaw and tell me what you sizzaw

Nas	9	N.Y. State of Mind	Illmatic	1994	[Verse 2]	"Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stock, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind"

Eminem	15	Criminal	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Verse 3]	"Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it (Go, go, go!)
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it and if anybody identifies
The guy in it, I hide for five minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad, so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'ma be a fuckin' rapist in a Jason mask"

Mack like Goldie, it's the same story

Wiggle it a little bit, throw it to the south

Throw it like a stallion, you wearing my medallion"

When a fool try to play me, wet him up then I'm Swayze
You must be crazy, kid
Ran? I never did
Forever wildin', that's how we live up in the 'Bridge
You just sit scared
Cock back the Gat, then hit a nigga like a bid
Twenty-five? Nah, kid, you gettin' life
Forever burnin' in hell, niggas is trife
It's the semi-auto, you can bring it on, yo
I'm pullin' out, strippin' niggas just like a porno flick
I'm sick, the Mobb rolls thick
Cross paths with my clique, and get vic'
I'm on some bullshit, that's how I was raised, G
Each level is a stage
Have you slidin' down blazin', pools of alcohol
Walk before you crawl
I'm in this to win this, you gonna take a fall
The Infamous Queensbridge — we on the scene, kid
Creepin' on those who caught sleepin' — don't ever do that
I run with two MAC's, and plus my crew backs my every move
I choose givin' crews the blues
I'm open off the Dainy
Obey me, or get sprayed with the sweeper 'cause I'm my brothers keeper
The Grim Reaper holdin' with nothin' but big batters and big heaters
Blow you three times, leave a mark like Adidas
Jig you, I know how to fix you
Pretty-boy niggas frontin' hard is the issue
Word to my unborn — you get scolded, old and molded
When I get bent, you get folded
Every rhyme is the truth that I must get 'cross
Put you right on your back, take it to the source
No doubt, I'm stuck and I can't get out of this lifestyle
The 41st Side — get bent, run wild
The 41st Side, too, you know how we do
Violate, motherfucker, I'ma see you
With the Linden, it's the start of your endin'
Settin' it again and again"

With a fortune walkin', you a walking coffin'
The musket, I tucked it, you bluff it, I bust it
You're sideways talking, so I lay often
I wait patient, to duct tape hatin'
Fuck ass niggas, get bucked ass niggas
Pluck ashes of Cuban cigars, you foolin' with Nas
That's my name and I came with Rugers this time
And if I'm sane that Soul Plane movie's the bomb
Word to my mom's name tattooed to my arm
You can't revolve me, embalm me, calm me or harm me
Rob me or dodge these bullets I'm busting
See that's malarky you yappin'
I open up the tripod to put the Gatling on, and I start clappin'

Eminem	15	Crack a Bottle	Relapse	2009	[Chorus]	"So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk"
OutKast	28	Vibrate	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse 2]	"The circumcision has already begun
Desensitizing the very thing or thang
That brought you into this motherfucker in the first place
And when I say ""motherfucker"", I do mean ""motherfucker""
Because Mother Earth is dying
And we continue to fuck her to death

Become the master of your own 'bation
And yes, God is watching you
But no need to be embarrassed
For the future is in your hands
No, the future is in your hand
Play with your own score sheet"

Don't look for trouble, but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way
You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sendin' it your way
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
‘Cause this is my space, you invade it
Live to regret it, and you'll die tryna violate it

Nas	9	Ghetto Prisoners	I Am...	1999	[Verse 3]	"You wanna buy time? I'm the seller of minutes
I give you every second low-priced, if I sold lies; the truth is
Time waits for none of you, in fact
He can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you
Small visions of better life if cheddar was right
Lurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time
Trapped in the slums, beggin' for nuttin' but takin'
Headed for nuttin' but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin'
Judges is not relatin' to pleas, guns bustin' where the kids play
Richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes
In bystanders, get cancelled, D.O.A
Around the way where we from
Hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young
Life is every man's kingdom, a dyin' man's past
And a newborn's, first time to be here at last
And shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain
Hustlin' harder than the generations here before he came
Goin' through the same bullshit as our fathers
Readin' history, but who's the authors?
For some, the game is easy, for most of us, the game is much harder
But never lose faith; through the years just get smarter
Ghetto prisoners, ghetto prisoners"

Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck

'Cause I just don't give a fuck"

Bitch bounce that ass while you roll that blunt, it can't hurt
While you wet and come up out that skirt, bend over, make it squirt
You can be my Superhead, maybe we should try that first

That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you"
Dr. Dre	1	Imagine	Tha Blue Carpet Treatment	2006	[Verse 1]	"Imagine it never happened

Imagine niggas trapped imagining having action
Imagine how these niggas could be actin' if we never got this shit crackin'
Imagine life's so hard
You can't imagine, it's like livin' in the City of God, you feel me?
Imagine life on the yard
Or tryna get that dollar on some shitty-ass job
Imagine Biggie with his son
Imagine Pac gettin' called ""Pop"" by one
Imagine a mother struggling
Dealing with a system that don't give a fuck about who shot her son, hm
Imagine life where you can't win
When you get out of the ghetto, and go right to the pen
When you get out to the pen, you go right to the gin
So if you get back to the streets, you go right back in, hm
Imagine Russell still struggling
No Def Jam, just another nigga hustlin'
And ain't no rocks on them fellas
Just rocks on them fellas, just tryna keep it bubblin'
Imagine niggas just stuck
From the East to the West Coast, everybody fucked up
I can't imagine no less
But it don't take imagination to know niggas been blessed with hip-hop"

Common	22	Sum Shit I Wrote	Resurrection	1994	[Verse 1]	"Marks I erase like racism, I'm as large as a bigot
Brew is my escapism, when I'm bubbly I just kick it
What I need from you is understanding that I'm standing
On my own two, down with my own crew
Toe cancer, I'm bad to the bone too, I'm prone to snap off
When I'm off that Cognac I can't hold back like a masseuse
I get loose like a screw turned from left right to tight
Man, when it's time for some action I get red, tonight's da night
An eye for an eye, a life for what's right
Dissect it I'm on hi-tech shit computers want to bite
Your style is Pascal, mine is Basic and just instinct
I'm went to F.A.M. and ran scams, me and Murray got up on big links
And if knowledge is the key, goddammit uh I'm the locksmith
Studied the missionary waitin on my life, the mic I Rush like Boss is
I switch styles like a channel with controls that is remote
Engage in a page, and with words I elope
Walking down the aisles with styles I freak the vow(el)s
That tie knots when I rocks like a Z-28
At any rate, brothers gain interest cause I loaned them microphones
They couldn't house the shit so they had to rent to own
It's like that, coming from the Go rapper
I wanna bone Jada Pinkett and that ho Patra
So keep on, and you don't, now come on
Ah keep on, and you don't"
Guru	20	What I’m Here 4	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 1]	"I take action the minute that the crowd gets hype
I'm type crashin, down like a meteorite
I'm Bogart-ing, mics and whole stages
Destroying MC's dreams, from words to whole pages
Their rapbooks, look more like scrapbooks
With their fictional fairytales and frail ass hooks
A lot of shit has happened, since I started rappin
There's been enough beef, and enough gat clappin
There's been mad signs, for this brother to heed
And while some choose greed, I choose to plant seeds
For your mental, spirit and physical temple
Bob your head to it, there's the water you've been lead to it
Bathe in it, a long time you've been cravin it
Prance to it, use your third eye and glance through it
Your state of being, becoming advanced through it
While others rhyme with no reason I be breezin
Their mics I seize them, then I try em for treason
I used to always like to hang out
Now I lounge in the rest writin bombs while tracks bang out
I know you peeped me in the club then
But now I'm in your speaker, with the voice that you're lovin"
Big L	25	The Big Picture (Intro)	The Big Picture	2000	[Verse]	"Yo, you know the game plan
C-Town, that's my main man
We never bring luggage, we go shoppin' when the plane lands
Still run with the same clan, used to be a Kane fan
Everything I rock is name-brand
L'll make your dame swallow
Your ice don't shine and your chain hollow
While you front in clubs for hours with the same bottle
Takin' midget sips, I run with the richest cliques
Tap the thickest chicks, plus drop the slickest hits
You know nothing about L, so don't doubt L
What's this motherfuckin' rap game without L?
Yo, that's like jewels without ice
That's like China without rice
Or the Holy Bible without Christ
Or the Bulls without Mike
Or crackheads without pipes
The Village without dykes
Or hockey games without fights
Don't touch the mic if you unable to spit
Flamboyant is the label I'm with, motherfucker"

Pull up a chair, hon', and put it in the air, son
Dog, whatever they call you, God, just listen
I'll spit a story backwards, it starts at the endin'
The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet holes close in this chest of a nigga, now he back to square one
Screamin', ""shoot don't please"", I put my fifth back on my hip
It's like a VCR rewindin' a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch, my caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van, they closin' shut
Goin' reverse, slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out somethin' crazy like, ""Go he there""
Sittin' back in his chair, we hittin' the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt, the blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinnin' records backwards of AC/DC
I give my niggas dap, jump out the van, back first
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like, ""Outside right we""
So with my mouth wide, holdin' my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for you
'Cause Jungle said, ""Block your on enemy's the""
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang
I'm laid in the bed, thinkin' about this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her, ""No hell,"" she talkin' 'bout, ""Me kiss""
Bobbed her head then spit a nut back in my dick
Started suckin' with no hands, a whole lot of spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me, ""Stressed really I'm""
Picked up her Gucci bag and left a nigga behind
Walkin' through the door, she rang the bell twice
I vomited vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three to two to one
And that's about the time the story begun
That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said, ""Son, we found that nigga we gotta kill"""

Oh God, don't let him control y'all

But researchers never found all the pieces yet
Scientists try to solve the context
Philosophers are wondering what's next
Pieces are took to labs to observe 'em
They couldn't absorb 'em, they didn't deserve 'em
My ideas are only for the audience's ears
For my opponents, it might take years
Pencils and pens are swords
Letters put together from a key to chords
I'm also a sculpture, formed with structure
Because of my culture, I'm equipped to construct the
Technical styles that'll be full of technology
Complete sights and new heights after I get deep
You don't have to speak, just seek
And peep the technique"

The music is different yeah? The vibrations are different. Not like planet earth. Playing
The very sound of guns. Anger. Frustration. There was no one to talk to from planet earth
To run us down. We set up a colony for black people here. So we they can do on planet on
Their own without any white people there. They can drink in the beauty of this planet. It
Will effect their vibration. For the better of course. Another place in the universe. Up under
Different stars. That would be where the altered destiny would come in. Equation wise
The first thing to do is to consider time as officially ended. We work on the other side of
Time. We bring them here through either isotope teleportation. Transqualecuzation. Or
Better still teleport the whole planet here through music. Music. Music. Music. Music. Music
Music. Music"

Give me the keys, I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in the cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab (Yeah)
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud

We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold

‘Cause that's Jesus, people
And Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much, Passion Of Christ need a sequel, yeah
Like Roc-A-Fella needed Sigel
Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle

Now, look me in my eyes and say, ""I do""
Drivin' off in the Rolls Royce, just married on the plates
We can spend our honeymoon in the States
You can throw your friend the bouquet
Somethin' in the back of my head say, ""Why us two?""
Maybe 'cause I love you
Hug you, squeeze you, touch you, tease you
As long as we together, it's heaven for me to please you
Won't stop 'til I tell you me to, beautiful

I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightnin'
And frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital, lost

Ain't nothin' changed, set it off, I let the brains hang
Guess who's back to put niggas on they back
Feel the contact, niggas running free better fall back
I'm fifty niggas deep, beat sleep
With a Mossberg wrapped in my sheets
Three deep in my Jeep chief run with the Young Gunz
Strugglin' and strivin', that's how the dough come
Now get gunned by the one with the gun for the low goal
Throw a bolo so low when I flow yo
Much too high to read the signs, I'm blind
Clickin' on the nine, out to get mine
I go big up, big up, gotta make the room, boom
Blowin' motherfuckers to the moon
Niggas need to feel me a real G, humbin' the bumblin'
See me on the block, strugglin'
And rollin' with the roughnecks 'nuff checks cashed
I get in niggas ass, blast
Straight strugglin'"

Big Pun	24	Off Wit His Head	Yeeeah Baby	2000	[Verse 5]	"Aiyyo it's off with his head
Nigga I was born in the fuckin Dawn of the Dead
I always got my Dunn like I always got my gun
Fresh out the box, oiled and cocked, Glock 21
Once I've begun to pop, I ain't gon' stop til I'm done
So either call the cops, or bust a shot - nigga uhh
Cause I'ma ride for my niggas, die for my niggas
Puff lye with my niggas til I'm high with my niggas
Hold me down Pros'"

Lupe Fiasco	23	Just Might Be OK	Lupe Fiasco’s Food & Liquor	2006	[Verse 1]	"Affirmative no further furnishing is needed
I believe we are completed, dig
We all in agreement on the wallpaper
Happy with the color scheme, welcome to the crib
A two family Habitat For Humanity
With a view of where the insanity live
My vida loca was built like Bob Vila via God
He architected, I arted what I harbored, Jimmy Carter
From Chicago's west side, finish my construction now
We hold the coming like contracepts
I'm conscious, 'cept the cons I kept
From conversations held with the Satan on my shoulder
Which lead to steps that kept me looking over the shoulder
Like chauffeurs, where my angels at
Painful yet Mary I ain't Jerry Garcia, ma
Here but I'm grateful, church!"
Kendrick Lamar	16	tv off	GNX	2024	[Verse 1]	"They like, ""What he on?""
It's the alpha and omega, bitch, welcome home
This is not a song
This a revеlation, how to get a nigga gone
You need you a man, baby, I don't understand, baby
Pay your bill and makе you feel protected like I can, baby
Teach you somethin' if you need correction, that's the plan, baby
Don't put your life in these weird niggas' hands, baby (Woah)"
JAY-Z	6	Allure	The Black Album	2003	[Chorus]	"It's just life, I solemnly swear

Man, it called me right back "
Kanye West	5	Drunk and Hot Girls	Graduation	2007	[Verse 2]	"I don't want to drop your friends off, I just want you
You drunk and hot girls
You want to sit down but we hit the drive-thru

Lupe Fiasco	23	I Gotcha	Lupe Fiasco’s Food & Liquor	2006	[Verse 1]	"They call me Lupe, I'll be your new date
They wanna smell like me, they want my bouquet
But they can't, they accented like the UK
Turn that eau de Lupe to Pepe Le Pew spray
Flagrantly fragrant and they can't escape it
My perfume pursued them everywhere that they went
You don't want a loan, leave my cologne alone
It's a little too strong for you to be putting on
Trust me, I say this justly
I went from musty to musky and y'all can't mush me
I warn y'all cornballs, I hush puppies
The swans in the pond call my duck ugly
But now they hug me, because it's lovely
They love the aroma of a roamer of the world
Got the shakers and the skaters and the players and the girls
Keep the fakers and the flakers and the haters in a twirl"
Rakim	10	The Saga Begins	The 18th Letter	1997	[Verse 2]	"Yo, my never-endin' epic, got the world spinnin' hectic
I quickly spread it 'til the whole city's infected
Suspense that I supply intensify, then commence as my daily events go by
You get involved in this, paragraphologist
Narratin' novelist, market this, sound marvelous
I'm the star in this, which means the author's authentic
Most definite, every episode's a epidemic
So when you research, check it, here go the evidence
They represent with lyrical negligence for presidents
My science existed, without the fiction
Every inscription is a special edition"
Kanye West	5	FML	The Life of Pablo	2016	[Verse 2]	"See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico?
Remember that last time, the episode?
Asking me why the hell I text in code?
Four times just to say, ""Don't text me, ho""
Told you four times, ""Don't test me, ho""
And we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'ma have the last laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called ""Check-a-ho""
Yeah, I'ma have to laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called ""Check-a-ho""
And I..."

Eminem	15	Rabbit Run	8 Mile	2002	[Verse]	"Some days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
Every time I go to get up, I just fall in pits
My life's like one great big ball of shit
If I could just put it all into all I spit
'Stead of always tryna swallow it, instead of starin'
At this wall and shit while I sit, writer's block
Sick of all this shit, can't call it shit
All I know is I'm about to hit the wall
If I have to see another one of Mom's alcoholic fits
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it
I ain't dealin' with another fuckin' politic
I'm like a skillet bubblin' until it filters up
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin' up
Blow this buildin' up, I've concealed enough
My cup runneth over, I done filled it up
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts
You think, all I do is stand here and feel my nuts
Well, I'ma show you what, you gon' feel my rush
You don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch
Peel the Dutch, I'm about to tear shit up
Goosebumps, yeah, I'ma make your hair sit up
Yeah, sit up, I'ma tell you who I be
I'ma make you hate me 'cause you ain't me
You wait, it ain't too late to finally see
What you closed-minded fucks were too blind to see
Whoever finds me's gonna get a finder's fee
Out this world, ain't no one out their mind as me
You need peace of mind? Here's a piece of mine
All I need's a line
But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme
To express how I'm really feelin' at that time
Yeah, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
It's just “Sometimes”, it's always me
How dark can these hallways be?
The clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half-past three
This half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece of paper
I'm desperate at my desk
If I could just get the rest of the shit off my chest again
Stuck in a slump, can't think of nothin'
Fuck, I'm stumped, but wait, here comes somethin', nope
It's not good enough, scribble it out
New pad, crinkle it up and throw the shit out
I'm fizzlin' now, thought I figured it out
Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid?
Why am I a slave to this trade? Cyanide I spit to the grave
Real enough to rile you up
Want me to flip it? I can rip it any style you want
I'm a switch hitter, bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter
I'ma sit, until I get enough in me to finally hit a
Fuckin' boilin' point, put some oil in your joints
Flip the coin, bitch, come get destroyed
An MC's worst dream, I make 'em tense
They hate me, see me, and shake like a chainlink fence
By the looks of 'em, you would swear that Jaws was comin'
By the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawin' someone
By the way they're runnin' you would swear the law was comin'
It's now or never, and tonight is all or nothin'
“Momma, Jimmy keeps leavin' on us
He said he'd be back, he pinky-promised, I don't think he's honest”
I'll be back, baby, I just gotta beat this clock
Fuck this clock, I'ma make 'em eat this watch
Don't believe me? Watch, I'ma win this race
And I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch
I found my niche, you gon' hear my voice
Till you're sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice
If I gotta scream, till I have half a lung
If I have half a chance, I'll grab it—Rabbit, run"

Drinkin', smokin', hates her baby daddy, craves shoppin'
E poppin', ecstasy takin', won't finish her education
Best friend she keeps changin', stuck with limitations
Lustin' men, many hotels, Fendi, Chanel
With nothin' in her bank account frontin' she do well
Her kid suffers, he don't get that love he deserve
He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse
No job, never stay workin', mad purty
Shorty, they call her the brain surgeon
Time flyin', she the same person
Never matures, all her friends married, doin' well
She's in the streets yakkety yakkin' like she was twelve
Honey is twenty-seven, argues fights
Selfish in her own right for life
Guess she's in her second childhood"

The Game	13	From Adam	The Documentary 2.5	2015	[Verse 2]	"I was playing Madden then I heard a knock
Everybody know I got shot but this for niggas that forgot
Sometimes I thank God that I got set up
When you shot twice in the chest, it's kinda hard to keep your head up
Suspect one: the homies never came to see me
Suspect two: Red hid my gun behind the TV
Suspect three: I was beefing with this Crip in my apartment
Shit started cause we fought and he couldn't see me
There's usually ten niggas in our dope spot
Cold ass night, I'm like a janitor at Wing Stop
I usually play Xbox with the gun cocked
I'm cool with taking mine, but I took other niggas' gunshots
Chest wide open, I'm tryna fight, but my lungs not
Hole in my chest 'bout the size of a kumquat
I know who shot me 'cause I shot them
But who set me up? I ain't tripping but—

I used to hate hip-hop—yup, because the women degraded
But Too $hort made me laugh; like a hypocrite, I played it
A hypocrite, I stated, though I only recited half
Omitting the word ""bitch""—cursing, I wouldn't say it
Me and Dog couldn't relate 'til a bitch I dated
Forgive my favorite word for hers and hers alike
But I learned it from a song I heard and sort-of liked, yeah
Further, ice and glamorized drug dealing was appealing
But the block club kept it from in front of our building
Gangsta rap-based filmings became the building blocks
For children with leaking ceilings catching drippings with pots
Coupled with compositions from 'Pac
Nas's It Was Written, intermixed with my realities and feelings
Living conditions, religion, ignorant wisdom, and artistic vision
I began to jot, tap the world, and listen
It drop—"

We was only in our teens our dreams were simplistic
Jumped the broom but it seems I tripped I must have slipped
After exchanging of the rings these things you give me lip
But not the kissing of the bride the dipping of the groom
The shit that make a nigga up and leave up out a room
More like ""boohoo"" then ""boo"" ""fuck you"" and ""fuck you too""
(Fuckin' bitch)
Kids cover them ears
It appears that ya mama want drama we need a comma
Or some space between words for better or for worse
This is not what I deserve the worse that I can take

Everything we built together was ours now it's all yours
Thats hard... It's all yours... Good God!"

From the conversations we have and the way it ends
You wanna discuss me in front of your lady friends
That's why it's just me in my Mercedes Benz
It all depends, maybe if we make amends
We can start from scratch
Learn to control your temper and remarks in fact
We plan to be platonic with our hearts intact
So every time we separate, somebody's marchin' back
You're amazin' in the sack
Eyes slanted like you're Asian but you're Black
God bless whoever gave you all of that
If you seen her from the back
You'd understand why they stare like that
And ain't a flaw to her toes, the Lord knows
Her pussy good enough to miss award shows
And I ain't gotta say nothin', she just knows
By the way I look at her to take off all her clothes
Up and down, then OHH!"

Not the frantic freak type, but if you speak right
You get to take her out and dig her out on a weeknight
Weekends, she wants to spend your ends
Her shopping spree is colossal, attitude semi-hostile
Mack diva senorita, no reefer, no pizza, just
Shrimp and lobsters, champagne and mobsters
Suckin up the cream like a vac to a carpet
Strictly black market now you're her next target
Watch out... cause yo she knows what she wants"

Gained this masculinity we pimpin', we not pretendin'

The drama means nothing, it's part of the game
Catch me in the coupé switching lanes or in the jeweler switching chains
I upgrade from dirty ""BS"" to clean VS
Rocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curb and get nauseous, watching the spinners spin
I made plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite your ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender, make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B

Tan khakis and them Nike Airs with the dyed checks
I was forced to live this life, forced to bust my chrome
My pops left me in a foster home
I felt abandoned like Quik now that Mausberg gone
So I don't hop in the SS without the Mossberg homes
I've been rappin' for a year and a half, my life is real
Put the gun in his mouth, he gon' bite the steel
Come to Compton, I got stripes for real
Before Dre, before the ice, before the deal - I was almost killed
Like 'Pac before the Death Row deal
I got shot over two pounds of weed, still ain't found them niggas
But karma come quicker for a nigga on the other side of the gun
That's somethin' I gotta teach my son"

Never seen twenty-twos on the six before
I am killin' 'em out there, they needin' first aid
'Cause the boy got more sixes than first grade
The crib got killer views and square feet
You have to film MTV Cribs for a week
So sleep if you need to, mami, I will leave you
Right where you stand, nah, I don't wanna dance (I'm good)

I watched you take some penitentiary chances to say the least
Remember in the county building with MixedByAli
We tried to freak the system just to make a couple ends meet
That's my nigga for shit sure
He brought Q over, but Q didn't rap, but he learned from our inspo
We split Louisiana chicken riverboat specials
Sleepin' next to 02R consoles to be our refuge
He was homeless and I left home

The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world"

Tear ya outta ya frame with a bag full of clips
'Cause I got a family that waits for my return

I'mma get back to New York in one piece
But I'm bent in the sand that is hot as the city streets
Skylights up like fireworks blind me
Bullets, whistlin' over my head remind me
President Bush said ""Attack""
Flashback to 'Nam, I might not make it back
Missile hits the area, screams wake me up from a war of dreams
Heat up the M-16
Basic training, trained for torture
Take no prisoners, and I just caught ya
Addicted to murder, send more body bags
They can't identify 'em, leave the name tags
I get a rush when I see blood, dead bodies on the floor

Ringing the bell, where in the hell, could they be at?
I'm about to leave stepping slow, where my truck was at
Who the fuck is that? Could it be a jack?
Now pull my strap, it's my man and we have the same plan
There them bitches go, Civic '94
Looking funny though, open up the car door, funny smile
Fuck two already, third ass was heavy
""Nas this is Sherry, Sherry this is Nas and his man, ready?""
Walked in the house, snatched off they clothes
Ran through them hoes, plenty ice, that they all seemed to like
Can't find my man, heard a blam-blam
Now I'm wondering, ""In this scam, do I even stand a chance?""
He killed the hoes, took all they dough
Fire in his eyes, higher than the sky coming down the stairs
Now he wanting mine, reaching for my nine
Aiming with our guns at each others face, at the same time
My nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering
""Put your gun down, we can skip town""
Rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat
Lift off his chain, took his shit, emptied out close range"

Think of what I wanna say, step in the booth and one-take it
How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hits
Then spit that classical L.A. N.W.A. shit
The media is bullshit, now we can't even say bitch
They accusin' Michael of touchin' kids in the wrong places
At first they embraced him, had a couple of facelifts
Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists
They comin', I can taste this, swear to God I ain't racin'

Let me collect the 40 ounce bottles in the dope spot
Bought my first Converse, thought I couldn't be stopped
When I creased up my khakis and threw on my Ronnie Lott
Used to think that I was hard, so I stole my brother's Glock
And that's the day my life changed, 'cause that night he got shot
Killed by another Crip over his Rolex watch
I got high for three years off that ""Chronic"" from the Doc
I was drinkin' 40 ounces a lot
And every liquor store in Compton sold out the day Eazy dropped

Say hi, Bob (""Hi, Bob!"")
Bob's thirty and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job 'cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year-old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping block (Ahh!)
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'Til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said, ""Knock it off!""
But Bob wouldn't knock it off, 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor
He grabbed Stace by the legs as he chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want it—it's bad for you"

I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck, I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, zero to sixty, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself
With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust

Got me this far, picture me quittin'

You rookies haven't done enough laps around the track
You had one hot single, but then your album sounds wack
Son, you bore me with your war stories
You ain't even do that shit, so that's just more stories
How you expect us to take you seriously?

Big Pun	24	Watch Those	Yeeeah Baby	2000	[Verse 2]	"Can't no comp come at me, this battle the Bronx'll back We got the nicest niggas alive talkin bout, ""Papi's nasty""
Cocky crafty like Rocky sassy Puerto Rock Apache
Posse not even the cops could catch me
I'm too fast - four-hundred pounds, but I move ass
Soon as you spoke, I already smoked you with two jabs
My game is tight - you wanna play, just name your price
Fame to ice, your brains your life, the game is sheist
And I'm the trifest on the field
Even in school I was nominated the most likeliest to kill
This bastard steal, a full clip and a extra
And I'mma blast ya til your whole click respeta
Leave you muerta, it ain't me it's the metra
'tate quieta, the bitch got a bad temper
Don't surrender - you ain't got a chance
You be lucky to leave here half-dead, in an am-bu-lance
So take a chance, but expect the worst
Put my foot so far up your ass
The sweat on my knee'll quench your thirst

Eminem	15	My Fault	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Verse 1]	"I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date (Ooh)
Susan, an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin'
Who love booze and alternative music (What up?)
Told me she was going back into usin' again (Nah)
I said, ""Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze and the gin
C'mere, let's go in here, who's in the den?""
""It's me and Kelly!""
""My bad"" (Sorry)
""Let's try another room""
""I don't trust you""
""Shut up, slut, chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, butt-naked, and run in the woods""

She asked to hold 500, I let her hold deez nuts
Bitch what? You fuckin' niggas when you got cramps
Talkin' bout eat these groceries, bitch you on food stamps
You gotta watch these hoes, they get your ass splattered homie
Never trust a bitch if she got the hood tattered on her
Brother, he a gunner, got an uncle from the hunnaz
Two baby daddies, one from the 60s and one from the Jungles
Make it even worse, her whole family's full of killers
After the funeral she right back to the followers and filters
She got a Range and a Benz
Doin' credit card schemes with her ratchet ass friends
Bitch just stole a TV from Target
Yellin' at her kids while Joseline and Stevie be arguin'
She blocked from Drizzy's page now she all on my dick
I hit her with a hashtag like (Bitch you ain't shit)"

My plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
I'm dying inside, I wonder if Zion inside the heavens
A condom, a Rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a MAC-11
That's all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right
But I'm right on the edge of Everest and I might jump tonight
Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice?
Well it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a fucking liar
When I lie on my back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
I wonder if I'm just a villain, dealing my morals away
Some people look at my face then tell me don't worry 'bout it
I give 'em back they deposit, no money, just total silence
I'm running, they say I'm wildin', a youngin' with lack of guidance
That's hundreds of us with problems
Mo' money, mo' drugs and violence
Look at the soul of an out-of-control artist
That's dealing with life the hardest, that's on my life
But regardless I'ma—"

I'd hate to be in the pen for clapping one of my fans

When you meet me, when you see me
If you real, my nigga, you know how to holler, ""G-Unit""

Why you ain't fuckin' with me? You cut me deep as Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home training
That ain't what you like, ain't it?
What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle

What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggas'll move on you
Only if they know what your weakness is, I have none
Too late to grab guns, I'm blastin' 'cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed, body found in a dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous 'cause fiends got they work and complained
Bitches left me 'cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true, she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon 'cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now"

The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryna chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset, ‘cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much, man, I'm just tryna do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo, I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please, I'm beggin' you, God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo, I hope you can hear me, homie, wherever you are
Yo, I'm tellin' you, dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
But, yo, I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go back to this 8 Mile Road"

Man I'm newer than a Jack I went up the hill with Jill
And Jack Jill's big bootay
We did the booty up, I told the Bitch she Betta Have My Money
Or step to the AMG
You know Com Sense, oh yeah him be
That nigga that be making all the bid-by-by-bye sounds
But since then, Common calm down!
I'm on some calm shit watch Com get complicated
Simple motherfuckers say the way that Com communicated
Was too complex, I got a complex not to complain
On my brain no complain and so will my community
And I prefer compliments
So I complement at an angle of ninety degrees
It's the nineties and music got known for the grease
I got a sense of direction and a compass
Com passed emcees with no compassion, though I heard the screams of
But I ain't shy, so why shall I comfort?
Com should have been at the fort with Jeff I'm so ill
But I chilled in my compartment with no company and no meals
Now Com could get the penny, but I want my own company
And Com is on a mission not to work for commission
It's a common market and it's so much competition
But to me, competition is none
To my comp I'm a ton I get amped like Watts in a riot
My compact disc is a commodity, so buy it
Instead of competing with Pete
Com compromised, Com made a promise
Not to commercialize, but compound the soul
With other elements, compelling sense into Communism"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	Follow the Leader	Follow the Leader	1988	[Verse 3]	"A furified freestyle, lyrics of fury
My third eye make me shine like jewelry
You're just a rent-a-rapper, your rhymes are minute-made
I'll be here when it fade, I'll watch you flip like a renegade
I can't wait to break and eliminate
On every traitor or snake, so stay awake
And follow and follow because the tempo's a trail
The stage is a cage, the mic is a third rail
I'm Rakim, the fiend of a microphone
I'm not him, so leave my mic alone
Soon as the beat is felt, I'm ready to go
So fasten your seatbelt 'cause I'm about to flow
No need to speed, slow down and let the leader lead
Word to daddy, indeed
The R's a rolling stone, so I'm rolling
Directions is told, then the rhymes are stolen
Stop buggin', a brother said dig him, I never dug him
He couldn't follow the leader long enough, so I drug him
Into danger zone, he should arrange his own
Face it, it's basic, erase it, change your tone
There's one R in the alphabet
It's a one letter word and it's about to get
More complex from one rhyme to the next
Eric B. be easy on the flex
I've been from state to state, followers tailgate
Keep coming, but you came too late, but I'll wait
So back up, regroup, get a grip, come equipped
You're the next contestant, clap your hands, you won a trip
The price is right, don't make a deal too soon
How many notes can you name this tune?
Follow the leader is a title, theme, task
Now you know, you don't have to ask
Rap is rhythm and poetry, cuts create sound effects
You might catch up if you follow the records E wrecks
Until then, keep eating and swallowing
You better take a deep breath and keep following the leader"

Control the whole domain, and then show no shame
Make rappers go train, they so lame, playin with no game
Put em on the low flame til they can't claim no fame
I got, the range, better, stay in the slow lane
I make the flow change from hurricanes to a slow rain
Your thoughts are so plane, I rearrange your whole frame
Until my whole name grow out your brain like Rogaine
Letter by letter, I put words together
Once merged, apart never, they be heard forever
And then I grab a pen and stab him in his abdomen
And smash him in, throw his mic like a javelin
Then I explain verses, that remain on the surface
At times it get deep, but I never defeat the purpose
Never go out, to go the dough route, forever hold out
I never sold out, for any amount, no doubt"

You ain't even made it up to my throne
You ain't even authorized for this song
Might be best for you to get goin'
Best be careful about your tone
That shit can hit me wrong and it's on
I have tried my best to be calm
Please don't make me grab that phone (Uh-oh)

From the fucking bottom?

Decade after decade

But at the same time, I say, ""Why is it me?""
Am I the target for destruction?
What about the system and total corruption?
I can't work at no fast-food joint
I got some talent, so don't you get my point?
I'll organize some brothers and get crazy loot
Selling D-R-U-G-S's and clocking dollars, troop
'Cause the phat dough, yo, that suits me fine
I gotta have it, so I can leave behind
The mad poverty, never having, always needing
If a sucker steps up, then I leave him bleeding
I gotta get mine, I can't take no shorts
And while I'm selling, here's a flash report
Organized crime, they get theirs on the down low
Here's the ticket, wanna bet on a horse show?
You gotta be a pro, do what you know
When you're dealing with the code of the streets"

'Cause I only bring him out for that 187
He don't have a heart, I just keep feeding him shells
He get it popping in the hood, so his name rings bells
Ms. Jones stay on the 3rd floor, she called the cops on me
They came, I ran, I had to toss my other little homie
Niggas know I got new friends so they stay in their place, kid

Keep fucking 'round they gon' say hello to my little friend"

They don't want the same sentence, niggas get to snitchin'
If I could reverse demises and turn falls to rises
And bring back the niggas who was livest
Old hustlers, reminiscing on better days
They home, doing nothing, might as well be in a cage
Hating on young brothers, one foot in the grave
They used to love us
Till we found our own way through the maze
New York, set trippin' and flaggin'
Got the West Coast laughin'

While we're takin' part of this hip-hop art
Listen yo, the best way, it ain't always the fast way
And yes, the best way, it ain't always to act nasty
I'll open up the door always before you pass me
Baby Doll, because you're royalty"
Common	22	Resurrection	Resurrection	1994	[Verse 1]	"I stagger in the gatherin', possessed by a patter-in that be scatterin'
Over the global, my vocals be travelin', unravelin' my abdomen
In it's slime that's babblin' grammatics that are masculine
I grab the men, verbally badgering broads
I wish that Madelyne was back on Video LP
I went against all odds and got a even steven
Proceed to read and not believin' everything I'm readin'
But my brain was bleedin', needin' feedin', and exercise
I didn't seek the best of buys, it's a lie to textualize
I analyze where I rest my eyes
And chastise the best of guys with punchlines
I'm Nestle when it's crunch-time
For your mind like one time
If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine
'Cause I deliver like the Sun-Times
Confined in once-mines on dumb rhymes I combine
I'm hype like I'm unsigned, my diet I un-swine
Eating beef sometimes -- I try to cut back on that shit
This rap shit is truly outta control
My style is too developed to be arrested
It's the freestyle, so now it's out on parole
They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell
I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail
A Mr. Meaner fell on his knee for the jury
I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me
Motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints
They relinquished Sense, 'cause I was guilty in a sense"
Kanye West	5	Everything I Am	Graduation	2007	[Verse 2]	"And I'm back to tear it up
Haters start your engines, I hear 'em gearin' up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get they hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
'Cause they want gun talk, or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes, Reeboks, or A-di-dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows?
So, say goodbye to the NAACP Award
Goodbye to the India Arie Award
They'd rather give me the Ni-Nigga Please Award
But I'll just take the I Got a Lot of Cheese Award"
2Pac	18	So Many Tears	Me Against The World	1995	[Verse 3]	"Now, I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death, now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standin', about to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the Sun?
Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come"
Big L	25	Size ’Em Up	The Big Picture	2000	[Verse 1]	"Ayo, I shoulda been out, I'm deadly when I pull the pen out
Keep frontin', I'ma try your chin out, I knocked a lot of men out
I left 'em on the floor spittin' phlegm out
It's either that or I'ma squeeze the gat and pop ten out
You see Corleone, ice spinnin', jigged out, white linen
And if a bitch don't like me she must like women
Every time I come around you see your wife grinnin'
Don't be mad 'cause yo' career's in the ninth innin'
It's over now, nigga, leave the game
I'm from the Danger Zone where emcees get slain
Where thugs'll never hesitate to squeeze the flame
Where niggas be takin' drugs just to ease the pain
Hustlers flip cokey, 48 Hours like Nick Nolte
When I was OT, yo bitch wrote me
First day home I dived in it, left her thighs dented
Now that bitch be pagin' me every five minutes
Emcees I squash and disgrace, it's all about the Benjis
So why your bills got Washington's face?
A lot of cats be frontin', mad singles with a fifty on top
L tryna have the city on lock
Peace to Biggie and Pac 'cause they really were hot
Rap game, heavy hitters, it's a shame they no longer with us
Niggas wanna be L, ladies wanna see L
If I go to jail, you'll wear a shirt sayin', ""Free L!"""
Eminem	15	Kim	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Verse 1]	"Don't make me wake this baby
She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do
Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?
Oh, what's the matter, Kim? Am I too loud for you?
Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
At first I'm like, ""Aight, you wanna throw me out? That's fine""
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine
How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim
Look at your husband now! I said look at him
He ain't so hot now, is he? Little punk
() Shut the fuck up!
() You think I give a fuck?
Come on! We're going for a ride, bitch! Sit up front

We'll be right back, well, I will, you'll be in the trunk"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	Teach the Children	Don’t Sweat the Technique	1992	[Verse 2]	"Teach the children, save the nation
I see the destruction, the situation
They're corrupt, and their time's up soon
But they'll blow it up and prepare life on the moon
Sounds like Total Recall
But who got a spaceship, you get it, we fall
So hope for the best and expect the worst
The end is near and it's U-N-I verse
The one's that interfere with nature
Labeled you limited and underrate ya
His plans over rule when he separates ya
Now it's U-N-I verse, the one that hates ya
So we gotta let them know we're hip to the script
Change the skit, or we're about to flip
'Cause we want access to happiness
Living the good life and much success
Equal opportunity
Self awareness and unity
Education, the kids need a sculpture
Teach them the abacus and their culture
And that'll help stop the robbing, raping and killing
Poison neighborhoods are illing
But they import more keys from across seas
A drug disease hits the streets with ease
So keep on building, 'cause we gotta keep building
Til the answers are filled in
And make sure you don't stop till then
And if you do, remember the children"
Kendrick Lamar	16	PRIDE.	DAMN.	2017	[Verse 2]	"Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world"
Snoop Dogg	0	Lodi Dodi	Doggystyle	1993	[Outro]	"Yeah, uh, tick-tock, you don't stop

50 Cent	19	Blood Hound	Get Rich or Die Tryin’	2003	[Chorus]	"I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though

Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though
I love to pump crack, love to stay strapped
Love to squeeze gats, but you don't hear me though
I love to hit the block, I love my two Glocks
Love to bust shots, but you don't hear me though"
Sleepy Brown	29	The Train	Idlewild	2006	[Chorus]	"It's been a good long road

And I see the same bitch, that was in MY video
You know what I'm sayin'

Eminem	15	Marshall Mathers	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Verse 1]	"Yo
You might see me joggin', you might see me walkin'
You might see me walkin' a dead Rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollerin' at him 'cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin' (Ruff ruff)
Or leanin' out a window with a cocked shotgun
Drivin' up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Lookin' for Big's killers, dressin' ridiculous
Blue and red, like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12-gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off 'cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watchin' all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that shoulda been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin' and wristwatches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Rémy Martin
Startin' shit like some twenty-six-year-old skinny Cartman (Goddamn it!)
An anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instinct's to kill *NSYNC, don't get me started
These fuckin' brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch, retarded? Give me back my sixteen dollars!
All I see is sissies in magazines smilin'
Whatever happened to wilin' out and bein' violent?
Whatever happened to catchin' a good old-fashioned passionate ass-whoopin'
And gettin' your shoes, coat and your hat tooken?"

Mexi con Puerto Rico
Mixed with a sprinkle of black
So I'mma approach her like that
And let her know where I ride and reside at
My zone, the place that I call home
Is the world from Philadelphia to Rome
Picture me ey, entrepenuer with my nigga D-A
Rockin' tours and we still young boys
We got bitches, they got some bomb ass lips
She used to put 'em on this bomb ass dick
She always talked some bomb ass shit
She used to blow some bomb ass dick"

Repent! You burn up, you got me bent
I'm current as an event, got on big hoes at Freaknik
Frequently you're telling me Whoopty Woo can rock it
So? He ain't put no scratch in my pocket
Yo herb, with my hand I cock it
And rock it like that brother in Colors, 'cause I want y'all to live
My crew is too live, we sneakin' to the rear
But I can't get us all in free (What?)
It's just another case of that 2-dollar emcee

Now I'm straight; are you straight?
I'm straight as long as I got beer
I thought about it, Jack, and now I'm outta here"

Yo, this is where the bullshit stops
Where herbs get got
If you snitch, you get shot
We get down, and leave the town in a state of shock
(WE GOT) dangerous hang-out spots and slick cops
Place called Rikers Island where kids get locked
A lotta gear to rock with blocks of clothes shops
Styles are top notch, this is the place to watch
So blast the box, the radio station is hot
Ease your mind starin' at skylines from rooftops
Flip scripts for chips, and new whips off the lot
Quick to call a shot, politic' with thick plots
And the Garden of Eden against the sea that we got
To make sure the core of the Big Apple don't rot
Where seeing's believin', we be achievin' a lot
Where disc-jocks created hip-hop, check it out!

Manhattan - no doubt

Big Pun	24	Beware	Capital Punishment	1998	[Verse 2]	"Ayo, I warned you, now all niggas could do is mourn you
I'm born to kill and still thrilled to put it on you
There's no regrets, remorse only results in loneliness
Only the strong survive and strive through life as warriors
All of us die, some of us killed, even massacred
Who wanna try? Punisher will if you ask for it
I'm hazardous for your health and Hell's your next stop
For real, my shit's cocked, your world has just stopped
I'm not the one you should be underestimatin'
Come test your fate and I guarantee I'll be under investigation
You can't handle the whole, I'll slam you on your skull
Or we can go blow for blow like Evander and Bowe
You never know; however, though, I still hold the title
And owe my rivals a chance to dance with Mr. Homicidal
Hand on the Bible, I swear to defend my crown
I've been around since forever and never let it touch the ground
Don't fuck around and catch a rude awakenin'
My crew's basically waitin' patiently for you to move your patrons in
Then we'll surround you, form Desert Storm and pound you
Look around you, Terror Squad's everywhere like Soundview
The Boogie Down do it like nobody, who are we?
The foundation, you're facin' a whole army"

I rock on the mic and make the girls want to dance
Me without a lyric, is like a nigga without a beeper
I'm a blow this shit out, cuz I'm the joint like reefer
If Barry White was in the mob
I still would be deeper
Cause I had lyrics back when I used to run with Keyvin
MC's step to me, butt-ass naked like ""What's up?""
I said, ""You know you done fucked up
Now I'm sayin, ""You know you done fucked up""
Everybody that hear me say I'm jams like the NBA
Cause I'm on fire
If I was a Michelin I wouldn't tire
It's funny how time flies
Well I'm as fly as time
I don't believe in role models
But if I do, then I'm mine
I make brothers say ""True""
They see you and be like ""Fiction""
I want 'spect and dead presidents
Like Richard Nixon
I'm a coach not a player
Not a gay mc, I'm straighter
My style is similiar to AIDS
You can f with it now
But catch you later
You can't touch this, cuz this is what I'm feelin bro

In New Orleans they say I'm that nigga, ya heard me?
From them Southside blocks to Watts, West side don't front
You know about them Grape Street gangstas, G'd up

I pour my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat
I put my life on the line when I'm out on the street
Put my Teflon on, and roll with my heat
I keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown niggas
In the race for the cheese, I run laps around niggas
Soon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds
Soon as my sneaker went in stores, Reebok stock soared
I ain't gotta say I'm a boss, niggas can tell
The East Coast crib the size of a small hotel
The shit journalists write about me leave me confused
Have me feeling like the heavyweight champ when he lose
I read somewhere I'm homophobic, shit
Go through the hood, there's mad niggas on my dick
Now, we can get hostile, or we can do this smooth
TNT around, I can still make blow move"

You're too dumb to play your position so unique
I'll trey 8 your meat faggot vacate the streets
Gang Starr, First Fam, and TS, we way deep

Sneakin' to watch Playboy at night
We all must be caught up in worldly ways
Chemistry between boys and girls
Is a lot like when we went to the woods and laid with the squirrels
During P.E., we'd be explorin' each others privates
Hunchin' with all our clothes on until we felt excited then (Ah)
Oh, now it's on from here on out
Put yo hands in the atmosphere if you know what I'm talkin' about
Now if too harsh then walk on out and I'll see you on the next song
They call it horny because it's devilish, now, see, we dead wrong"

Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)

Let me ride, just another homicide
Yeah, it's me so I'ma talk on
Stompin' on the easiest streets that you can walk on
So strap on your Compton hat, your locs
And watch your back 'cause you might get smoked, loc

You fucked with me, now it's a must that I fuck with you"

Flower the graves of those opposin the Squaders
Thrown in the garbage, like funky pajamas

You fuckin with scholars, street knowledge
Carter kids stuck to the projects

Middle fingers up and say ""Fuck the world""
Throw your hands up, they can't fuck with you girl

Have prestigious women
That's the truth from the begining
In and out of the flyest hotels
You say your family don't know me
Hold on hommie, that's formost and promos
Sales, tails, scales and jails
Success before death
No one in my clique fails
As females with the almighty Father lead
Succeedin' ta give my peep's just what they need

You wanna battle? Well I live in New York
So think twice blink twice now your Roley and Lincoln's gone
Don't come into this rap game if you don't belong
You won't be on but for a minute anyway
You're just a scavenger, you don't live this life everyday
Rap is regional, so you can check the demographics
Everybody represent where they live, cause shit is drastic
Confusion, while I'm givin rappers contusions
And people don't realize that real hip-hop is losing
They wanna shut us down, and I say, ""Shut up clown!""
Cause New York is too corrupt and too tough to lay down
And just quit, cause MC's out here kick serious lyrics
And I come to you, with my infinite spirit
Not takin nothin from your hood or your set
But Gang Starr could be a threat, in New York we rep
That's where it comes from, that's why you're feelin it
So why supress it, I'd rather be revealin it
Bright lights, big city and dark alleyways
New York we get the money all day everyday"

Be easy, too many brothers seem to go to Heaven early
It's hell in these streets, but soon I'm on a hot streak
Who's in the hot seat, who had a felony beef
Yo I beat cases, with different attorneys
And I laughed at the racist DA's, who were wishing to burn me
My mom caught a heart attack around the same time
News articles were published around the same time
This depressed me more, but I stayed in tact
And that last corny chick I was with, she got played in fact
I know niggas that did dumb time and dumb crimes
I fuck with real niggas and never cowards with dumb minds
This country's got us in a fix
America, your deadly habits got us all up in the mix
War without, war within, holy war, mortal sin
Tell me - huh, what's the origin?"

My stories from violence to glory
Dog-eat-dog world, gory
In the gutter, brother despise brother
Throwing threats at each other
Broken bottles and bar fights with box cutters
Alcoholics, narcotics, organized
Families sleep from a gas stove, burned alive
They bagging up drugs with plastic gloves
On his way to the top with his cash, he shrugs
Kidnappers, degenerate thieves and gamblers
Stealing, panhandlers, wrapping grams up
Rubber bands on they Grams, what?
Playing cards and they bored
Members of gangs, living by and dying by the sword
Block parties, food stamp, debit cards
Your hood ain't no different from ours
We share the same dreams, same money
Same clothes and cars, instead we get the same jail bars"

Slippin' and slide through the streets
It takes a finesse, especially in this Cabriolet Jeep
Engine make it hard to creep
Just leave the gate open, through the side door, I'ma creep (Ooh, ooh)

Have everybody on the corner goin'

Set with juvenile rhymes, makin' fake-ass death threats
Big deal, like En Vogue, here's somethin' you can feel
Styles more tangible, and image more real
For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts
When it's time to go all out, you be like, ""Damn, he flipped!""
Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
Got the lyrical full clip, givin' you a verbal asswhip
Don't trip, it's the gifted prolific one
Known as Bald Head Slick, why is the press all on my di-dick?
My style be wilder than a kamikaze pilot
Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a friggin' riot
Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas
Yo, them motherfuckers are harrassable
For I be speakin' from my parables and carry you beyond
The mic's either a magic wand
Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Then I grab your palm, no pulse, you're gone
And if you thought we'd lose our niche
In this rap shit, you way wrong
I stay up, I stay on, shine bright like neon
Your song's pathetic, synthetic like Rayon
Fat beats, they play on
Want dope rhymes? Put me on
Word is bond
You know my steez"

Solids liquids and gases, and sparks of light within
Infinite lengths and widths and depths and heights
No beginning or ending, the seven dimensions
Enough space for more than a million worlds and inventions
To travel through time within enough room to be the womb
Of the most high's great mind which he will soon make shine
With intelligent elements in sight that he will gather
In the realms of relativity electricity struck matter
Energies explode he reload to keep releasing
Atoms by the millions, til the numbers increasing
'Til it was burning he kept returning itself to the source
The hotter his thoughts it gave the center more force
He gave birth to the sun which would follow his laws
All caused by his mental intercourse, who is God?"

Stop, pause, rewind before you put your rhyme out
And go to the ""Wizard of Oz""
And tell 'em that your tryin' to get yourself a brand new heart
A brand new start
'Cause you realized that you hadn't played your part
And that was smart
It's like a art the way I articulate
And break these bitches from state to state

She was cumin' hectic, two nuts at a time
It really didn't matter, cause, man, this bitch was fine
She was slippin' off the seats so I caught her
The girl had the lips that made me wanna fuck her harder
Grabbed me by my hand, she was moanin', ""Brad""
Opened up some more, and fucked her in the ass

‘Cause this right here is for all of y'all
Rakim and Premo — yo, I got what you need, bro
You go see a show, smokin' El Niño
And DJ's play hits with hard bass kicks
And then they display tricks like The Matrix
Make the record fly, undetected by the naked eye
So just feel the vibe, ‘cause your ears never lie
Nowadays DJ's bags of tricks, graphic
On some behind-the-back shit, catch it and scratch it
Blast it! This kid got his craft mastered
Hands is mad quick like he mix with magic
Spin it back and forth and grab it
And know just where it is… there it is!"

Get a little slice of Heaven, I can enter in again
Or maybe just imagine that I'm living in a mansion
Or a palace and my pizza gets delivered in a Benz
Make a savior out of savage like they made it out of magic
So it take a nigga havoc and then make it into friends
You don't even need a salad, that don't make a nigga fatter
Actually take a nigga backwards and make a nigga thin
That's a deep dish, Chicago town, get the peace stick
Home run hitter, I be drilling on the weak pitch
Pay into the plate then I put it in your face
I'm a man, never biting on the hands that I eat with, yeah

Even Beyoncé couldn't move it like this
She only fuck with soldiers, that's her shit
I hate to admit it but I love my bitch so much
I'm sittin' outside in the Benz
Thinkin' back to Dre's house when I fucked her best friend
The pussy wasn't nothin'
Now I'm dealin' with the diary of a mad black woman with Louis Vuitton luggage

Imagine going to court with no trial

No welfare supporters, more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked
Evidently, it's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping outta state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage, we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashing fashion, designer clothes
Lacing ya clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind

I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got"

See you when you think you on the low, ain't hard to spot you
You swore to keep it real after you blow

Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat getting the dough
Them old-timers advise you to them problems that's ahead
Drama with the Feds, not listening, just bobbing your head
Your Roley shining, thinking to yourself ""Nobody's taking mine""
At the same time, your ho is getting snatched from behind
Put in a van, ""Where's the hundred grand?!""
Stripping her hand from all the ice
Wouldn't you know? You knew these niggas all your life
What made them mark you victim?
You fucked up somewhere down the line
Now they had to target your Wisdom
She took 'em to your place, straight to your safe
You doubted it could happen, sick of yapping
Jump in your ride, headed to your side
Puffing ganja, get to your crib, can't find her
Just a reminder: Shouldn't have your stash house where you crash out
Could've passed out, your coke is gone, now you ass out
Dead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes!"

When he was young, living life fast and rhyming his truth
And if crack had took a part of the homies family tree
The lil' nigga he was talking 'bout was probably me
And him to know my life story and we not even meet
When we did, it was like we'd known each other for dealing
When the last time I seen him? He was playing his tape
That he would later title Makaveli the Great
Smile for me, yeah, it's strictly for my niggas
Try to touch money, high on weed and liquor
Hoping God'll forgive us, we been stuck here in the Matrix
Dead before you dishonor a nigga when he face him
Whatever shit you dealing with, you get you two Glocks

Jobs were given, better living, but we were kept out
Made to feel inferior, but we're superior
Break the chains in our brains that made us fear ya
Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
Honor a man that refuses to respect us
Emancipation Proclamation? Please
Lincoln just said that to save the nation
These are lies that we all accepted
Say no to drugs, but the governments' kept it
Running through our community, killing the unity
The war on drugs is a war on you and me
And yet, they say this is the home of the free
You ask me, it's all about hypocrisy
The constitution, yo, it don't apply to me
And Lady Liberty? Stupid bitch lied to me
This may be strong, and no one's gonna like what I'm pumpin'
But its wrong to keep someone from learning something
So get up, its time to start nation building
I'm fed up, we gotta start teaching children
That they can be all that they want to be
There's much more to life than just poverty
This is definitely, uh, words of wisdom"

That's a loss for the class and a score for the rifles
Three hots and a cot and some cops
Trying to find dinosaurs in the Bible
It's all quiet in the jailhouse
Then they ride in to find the empty cells out
They was looking for the swords
They was looking for the swords
I'm just looking at they feet 'cause I'm looking for the Lord
Looking in the library, looking at the law
10 years deep, now I'm looking at the bar
Claim sovereignty 'cause I'm bunkin' with the Moors
They degenerate, they ain't looking at the game
They just looking at the scores, they be putting on my books
'Cause I'm looking at the stars, trade a shank for some crank
Now I'm looking at a war, BGF got the yard
AB got the kitchen, snitches on PC
M&M on a mission but C.O.'s got the prison
God got us all, God set us free
God is the key, but the guards got the doors"

My mama house was in the middle of the street
How was a nigga supposed to get to school?
I hopped every backyard on my block
Till I got to  Elm Street, took the rag out my sock
And I could have been a Crip but I ain't like blue that much
All Crip school, I ain't really go to school that much
I was selling crack on Elm, bagging up sacks on Elm
With the ratchet in my Bulls jacket, giving you the facts on Elm
King Frog and Big Face, they had my back on Elm
We was fighting over territory with the T-Flats on Elm
I had to scrap on Elm, that's how I got my stripes
Air Max 95s, not a scratch on my Nikes

Pull out a pen, like a grenade, and drop it quick
I strike again and I'mma get paid, exotic shit
You know the God ra be, hot as the Mojave
Swing like King Usabi, my posse be kamikaze
On the corners like I'm homeless and I, don't know where home is
The bonus, is where the next open microphone is

She hoppin' on dicks, ridin' Pony's who trick
At my man's wake, she said the eulogy
After that I usually, bumped into her shoppin' for jewellery
Her bodyguard screwin' me, I gave her my math
Ain't nothin' new to me, blowin' backs out, six-pack Stout's
Wide fat mouth, the evil look with a bow-leg
Yo niggas said, ""Shorty's a pro, she blow heads
She push the fo' red, she know Feds, Feds know her""
A code red, maybe she's out to slay me, this bitch is crazy
She blew the celly up, meet me at the telly to fuck
She knew about cats from way back, we smoke the haystack
She never coughed once, blunts was her hobby
She said I knew her man probably, no doubt, '96 he tried to rob me

Now here I am three months later, full-blown relapse
""Just get high until the kids get home from school, homes, relax""
And since I'm convinced that I'm an insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep, so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium? Three?
And that will average out to about one good hour's sleep

Has taken four years to just put out an album, B
See, me and you, we almost had the same outcome, Heath

It was bologna, was it the methadone, ya think?
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos?
Your VCR tape cases, with your Ambien CR
Great places to hide 'em, ain't it? So you can lie to Hailie

Touch the button on the wall, you'll be pickin' up your own balls

I took a cop just in case things got tricky

Even if they don't try, some ladies test men
And this was a test that was bigger than him
Some believe it's the nature that is given to men
He had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home
One reason or another, couldn't find peace at home
She asked, ""Why do men always have to stray?""
He said, ""I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet""
""I used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin'
Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'""
It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say
And what you did in the past you gotta live with today
She asked if they could spend the night together
He thought, and said, ""I'm tryin' to get my life together""
Went home to his lady, these were his confessions

Pull through, I throw a fucking cocktail at your car
From the last shootout I got a dimple on my face

A shell hit my jaw, I ain't wait for doc to get it out
Hit my wisdom tooth, I (Huck-too) spit it out
I don't smile a lot 'cause ain't nothin' pretty
Got a purple heart for war and I ain't never left the city

But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
I've been a very good sport, haven't I, this year?
They say, ""He goin' crazy and we seen this before""
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Nigga, please, how you gon' say I ain't no Lo-head?
'Cause my Dior got me more model head?
I'm insulted, you should go 'head
And bow so hard 'til your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red

Guru	20	JFK 2 LAX	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 2]	"Peace to my man Hass, an Orange Man paying the cost
All the twenty-five-to-lifers, all my brothers getting tossed
Into the system, supposed to rehabilitate
It's why you gotta regulate your own mindstate
Read, study lessons and build your inner power
The next level, doesn't tolerate cowards
For example, I know this rich Nigerian
Powerful American that's proud to be an African
He asked me why do all us brothers be getting trapped
I told him I'd explain it, broke it down in a rap
Whether you got naps, braids waves or no hair
Without esteem for yourself, nigga, you going nowhere
And you can swagger like you rude as Josey Wales
Unorganized revolt almost always mostly fails
Give up the savage ways, be effective soldiers
To elevate the mental is to be poor no more
There's war in the streets, prepared men know best
I rhyme as live as it gets, JFK to LAX
They're always making trouble yo, against the righteous
Killing us in cold blood, those beasts, those vipers
And as I sit feeling the pain in my wrist
I vow to myself that I'ma change this shit
Or at least I gotta try or part of me will die
And only by action will any ideas solidify
So I inhale, exhale as I ponder
This grown man will make mistakes no longer
I've been there, I've seen how they make us fall victim
To their tricknowledgy, with no apology I diss em
And so I rip facts, to dope tracks I caress
You're gonna hear about it, from JFK to LAX"

MC Ren	17	Real Niggaz (LP Version)	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Verse 3]	"Falling deep in the drums of so many of styles
Is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles
Cheating and not beating, the crowd I kept seating
But weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating
Styles that kept them full of bull
Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
They got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggas pick up your record is cause they thought it was us"

Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect, I better check to see why you feel upset
'Cause I met your bitch on the internet now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet
That bimbo can put her lips all the way around this bone and then blow
Like a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo
Those were the days but I bet you, I'm never gonna be broke again, no
I don't smoke but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling Indo
And I keep it one comma, zero, zero, zero, zero
Real, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
Nickel-plated, twenty two, two, two
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I shoot you too
Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views
Run up in a church like pew, pew, pew
'Cause that's what I do, do, do
But, even to the untrained human eye
We ain't the same, you and I
Somebody should have explained to you why
For you to go against me, it's simply insane, you will die (Yeah)
That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah
But I know magic and here go my last trick
I'm 'bout to say ""Abracadabra"" and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat
I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react
But a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that
As I begin to fuckin' devour the track
And you backpedal, that is a cowardly act
Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapsed"

And they gon' vote me right in on my caucus and I'ma show these niggas how to get lawless
Why your hands out, askin', could you hold one? Who do I owe? Nigga, no one
They pickin' you up, but you low down, animated actin' frozen
I got porno pics, wish I can post them, stackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em

Them crackers gon' act like I ain't on they ass

Far from a Harvard student, just had the balls to do it
And no I'm not through with it

Niggas got a problem, Houston!
What up B, they can't shut up me
Shut down I, not even P.E., I'ma ride
God forgive me for my brash delivery
But I remember vividly what these streets did to me
So picture me lettin' these clowns nitpick at me
Paint me like a pickany
I will literally kiss TT in the forehead
Tell her, ""Please forgive me,"" then squeeze into your forehead
I'm not the one to score points off, in fact
I got a joint that'll knock your points off
Young Hova the God, nigga, blast for me
I'm at the Trump International, ask for me
I ain't never scared, I'm everywhere, you ain't never there
And nigga, why would I ever care?
Pound for pound, I'm the best to ever come around here
Excludin' nobody, look what I embody:
The soul of a hustler, I really ran the street
A CEO's mind, that marketin' plan was me
And no, I ain't get shot up a whole bunch of times
Or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines
And I ain't animated like, say, a Busta Rhymes
But the real shit you get when you bust down my lines
Add that to the fact I went plat' a bunch of times
Times that by my influence on pop culture
I'm supposed to be number one on everybody list
We'll see what happens when I no longer exist

And ain't nuttin sweet but the ladies who speak wetter
With a torn smile, tryin to get my song on file
It's on now, the whole town done gone wild
Kicked rhymes off my heartbeat as a unborn child
Then developed a strong style on Long Isle
Won't be long now, I started rhymin' young
I designed for fun, knowin' my time would come
I started, payin dues DJin' with crews
Learnin' the inner city rules, conveyin' the news
Soon as the jam start the man's art'll jam parks
Slam so hard it remains a landmark
The rhyme that I'm stylin', smooth as a violin
But rough enough to break New York from Long Island"

In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
""Cleanin' Out My Closet"" and all them other songs
But regardless, I don't hate you ‘cause, Ma
You're still beautiful to me, ‘cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm
Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm
And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to chemical warfare
And forever we could drag this on and on
But agree to disagree, that gift for me
Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kickin' me out? It's fifteen degrees
And it's Christmas Eve, ""Little prick, just leave!""
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat!
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when Dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fuckin' boat
You'd think that'd make us close (Nope)
Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine
And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight-years-old
And that's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but—"

She said one day I would right my wrongs and see paper
We started out young, lookin' for some identity, made a thousand mistakes
But never did we lack chemistry
Wrappin' my hand 'round your waist
That was back when you did whatever I say
Dreams of sellin' narcotics, runnin' blocks, or robbin' banks
I was in love with you, didn't know what it was with you
Kiss you in back of the class just to get a buzz with you
Some niggas wanted you, but they weren't committed
Preoccupied playin' John Madden and bullshittin'
Remember when granny died? You looked at me and said, ""Baby, dry your eyes
Depend on me as your relief, let your anger be mine""
We was locked in ever since then
So territorial, even took me 'way from my friends, hmm, hmm (Gah, gah, gah)"

Defyin' it, envious because I will rebel against
Any oppressor, and this is known as self-defense
I show no mercy, they claim that I'm the lunatic
But when the shit gets thick, I'm the one you go and get
Don't look confused, the truth is so plain to see
'Cause I'm the nigga that you sell-outs are ashamed to be
In every jeep and every car, brothers stomp this
I'm Never Ignorant, Getting Goals Accomplished
The Underground Railroad on an uprise
This time the truth's gettin' told, heard enough lies
I told 'em fight back, attack on society
If this is violence, then violent's what I gotta be
If you investigate, you'll find out where it's comin' from
Look through our history, America's the violent one
Unlock my brain, break the chains of your misery
This time the payback for evil shit you did to me
They call me militant, racist 'cause I will resist
You wanna censor somethin', motherfucker, censor this
My words are weapons and I'm steppin' to the silent
Wakin' up the masses, but you claim that I'm violent"
Eminem	15	Eminem - My Mom (ترجمه فارسی)	Relapse	2009	[Verse 3]	"Man, I never thought that I could ever be
پسر، هیچوقت فکر نمی‌کردم که بتونم یه روزی
A drug addict, naw, fuck that, I can't have it happen to me
یه معتاد بشم، نه بابا، گوه توش، نمی‌تونم بذارم این اتفاق برام بیوفته
But that's actually what has ended up happenin'
اما این چیزیه که اتفاق افتاده
A tragedy, the fuckin' past ended up catchin' me
یه حادثه، گذشته ی لعنتی که در نهایت به سرم اومد
And it's probably where I got acquainted with the taste, ain't it?
و احتمالا جایی‌ـه که با طعمش آشنا شدم، مگه نه؟
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb, Mom, beautiful
داروها بمبن، مامان، زیبا
She killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it
سگ لعنتی رو کشت با اون دارویی که بهش داد
Feed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache
بهش یه اسپایرین لعنتی بده بخوره و بگو که سردرد داره
""Here, want a snack? You hungry, you fuckin' brat?
«بیا، خوراکی می‌خوای؟ گشنته، بچه ننر لعنتی؟
Look at that, it's a Xanax, take it and take a nap, eat it""
نگاش کن، آلپرازولام‌ـه، بگیرش و یه چُرتی بزن، بخورش»
But I don't need it — ""Well fuck it then, break it up
اما نیازی بهش ندارم- «خب گوه توش، بشکونش
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up""
یه تیکه کوچیک بردار و بخورش تا نیتن رو بیدار نکردی»
Alright, ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'
اوکی، ماما، تو بردی، حوصله بحث کردن ندارم
I'll do it, pop it, gobble it, and start wobblin'"

Jay-Z	12	Coming of Age (Da Sequel)	Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life	1998	[Verse 2]	"Look at that fake smile he just gave me, it's breaking my heart
Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart?
I felt his hatred it was harsh -- 'fore this faking shit start
I should take him in back of the building and blaze him

It woulda seemed we was the closest, but to those that know us
Could see that something was about to go down

Prodigy	8	Kill That Nigga	Infamy	2001	[Verse 2]	"Ay yo this nigga runnin' 'round runnin' his mouth speakin' on the wrong shit

Rap asses get shot in they throat, speak on that
Girlie mouth nigga you worse than a bitch
I done shot niggas for you, put my life at risk
How you gonna go behind me and knife my back?
Must be insane and I got a cure for that
My hammer will knock sense in the nigga real quick
Nail a nigga tongue with the four fifth
Nigga you in violation of that code of silence
Niggas like you get real niggas indicted!
We can't have that! Kidnap that bitch!
Torture and torment that snitch!
We gotta make examples out these hummingbird fucks
Matter fact pull 'em out the trunk, I'm bout to

Scarface	11	One	The Diary	1994	[Verse 1]	"Sittin' at the stoplight, lookin' at hoes
Peepin' out this bitch in her black Girbauds
Windows rolled up tight, top was closed
Blowin' Swisher Sweet smoke out my nose
Opened up my door and asked the bitch, ""What's up?""
Lookin' at me crazy, I'm like, ""Bitch, what's up?""
She asked about my woman, I said ""My woman at home""
I asked about her nigga, she said her nigga was gone
I got my pencil and got the digits and things
And after three or four days, I gave that bitch a ring
We started talkin' and I dropped some shit
Gave her some game and now I got that bitch
Now she wants to give your homie some ass
But it's just one question I got to ask
Can you..."
Nas	9	The Flyest	Stillmatic	2001	[Verse 2]	"I do what I can do when I can do it
Feel how I feel when I feel what I'm feelin'
Live how I live, it's only 'cause I been through it
Learn to try it, like to eat it and shit, it's nuttin' to it
Burn it, light it, weed it and off the liquor
While drivin' outside I'll never catch a vehicular homicide
My music is a description of my vibe of course
My life, my sights, my thoughts, what I like on my fork
'Cause you are what you eat, you eat what you can
You pray to bless the food but first you wash your hands
To wash away them bad spirits, don't bring it in your home
Once you let them in they stayin', evil be gone, say it
I'm proud of Mase for givin' himself to the Lord
Wonderin' does Faith think about Big anymore
Of course my nigga Horse got married, see shit is changin'
We ain't these little niggas no more, runnin' dangerous
I like to bone, I'm a peaceful brother
Eat up so much the girls call me seafood lover
Be havin' they legs shakin', stab 'em, break 'em
I'm Hercules Hercules when havin' relations, the flyest"
Snoop Dogg	0	Doggyland	Tha Doggfather	1996	[Verse 2]	"Oh your homies think you're funny?
Doin' stick ups for moneys
Just to impress the honeys (This is for the honeys)
Got yo' rocks, so you keep'em in the sack
You got two strikes, but you right back up to bat
You all about yo' money and got something to sell
But if you fell for it, Bobby, you'll be back in a jail cell
You chillin' wit yo' feet up
Someone hated but baby without the homies and
That's when you got beat up
Because you can't be out there doin' low
And then right gather up yo' crew and roll
Ain't no rules when you out there doin' dirt
Somebody's always layin' in the cut to get ya' hurt
But see, I know a place where
You might wanna be
And I can take you there
Pop goes the nine, leave all that behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline"
Nas	9	Big Girl	Nastradamus	1999	[Verse 1]	"I'm the type that'll get you by the fireplace
Get you hype when I lick it, put it by your face
Sipping red wine, is it bedtime
You can kick it with your nigga while we listen to Faith
I'm feeling richer today,I can hit it then stay
Lingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play
We got champagne, whipped cream, I'ma grab a bucket of ice
Bubble bath running, and the candlelight feeling so right
It's your night, no stress, no fight
Mad at your ex, 'cause his dough tight
Never go right when you're with him
Try your best to forget him
'Cause it's easy to please me
CD skip when your head board hit the wall
Call for the lord
Right when you cum, I'm biting your tongue
Make your legs cramp up, you can't stand up
You can hit a blunt if you want
I'ma pull my pants up
We can discuss a weekend of lust on top of the trust
Tell me what's the reason for us
To love or to fuck
I'm the thug that you want
If it's gangster we can't front
If you want me I can stay around
If you need me, I'm here for you
How that sound?
Now it's up to you
Depending on how you wanna get down
'Cause you're a big girl now"

Nas was the first New York nigga rappin' with Dre
So of course I got a track to bring it back to your face
The one kid that would've been Aftermath that got away
But we still get together, like, every several years
To sprinkle a little bit of Heaven for your ears
Relax, sippin' Cliquot in Rio, stupid fuckers
Low-key, no G's, but it's still Gucci luggage
I love Cape Cod, and watching fly bitches with gray eyes
Wrestle in a tub of KY to get my day by
I like to celebrate, why? ‘Cause I can vision
Collages and images of my lies with no regret to hate
So every breath I take is all about the rules
It's hard for you to breathe, like you at high altitude
So crack the Patron, it's on heathens
The God's back, hard body, Mr. Jones never leavin'"

Livin' like the pharaoah Tut, I'm blessed with life
So I breathe deep and give praise to the most high
Then I, get fresh for a new day
I eat broccoli for breakfast and smoke my trees
Turn on the flat screen to C-Span, see the elite strength
Attorney general slowly gettin' bills passed
Prophecies comin' to pass

Sayin' some shit to make the bitches wanna suck our dicks

Communicating to y'all with the Compton slang
Compton's back in the house and your appartment
So open your door, by the way, so we can start it
Test the monitors and call this mic
Cause the way we feel, we're gonna fuck it up tonight
I got my mic in my hand, with a hell of a grip
Bitches screamin' and shit, now it's a trip
Waitin' for the grand finale, or the end
Or stupid rhymes set by Dre and Ren
Well, like a kid, we get new shoes and go faster
Smilin', like hell, as we move past the
Suckers, the motherfuckers with the ego hype
Well we're positive and they're on a negative type
And if think we're about to quit...

Soon as you lay me down to sleep, bitch, your soul I'ma try to take

I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how 'bout now, are you in the shower?
Scour you for six hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did ya figure out I was down in your basement? Now ya
Musta just heard the sound of my stomach growlin' from down there
Prowler, there's no one fouler, bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub, I drown ya with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power, such prowess, look how you cower
Jump out on you now like I was a Jawa from fuckin' Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt, beddy-bye-bye, beddy-bye-bye, it's time to die-die
Ought to not even bother to scream, it don't even matter
Amazing when grazin' skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not ya everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water
Nothing like Son of Sam, so, please, understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt? There's no fun in that, here I come with axe
Fun to act like lumberjack when I'm hackin' 'em up with that
What was that? Dial 9-1-1, someone's comin' in from the back"

Give every kid who got played that
Pumped-up feelin' and shit to say back

Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great

Buckshots are the payback for dumb shit
All you niggas on the block tryin' to test me
Best wear a vest or get open like, sesame
I'll run up on you mad deep; while you're tryin' to sleep
I'm steady pumpin' bullets in your sheets
Wake up, motherfucker, don't stutter
Point blank by a nigga from the gutter, yeah!
Gimme mine, gimme mine, gimme, mine
Ban my rhymes, now It's back to bustin', nines
And bustaz can't get none, hell no

I be that wrong nigga to fuck with, wouldn't I? (Wailin')
Wouldn't I be the wrong one to try, never eatin' chicken thighs
Only the twenty piece mojo, flows on like Flo Jo (Wailin')
I wanted to figure out, just how low could your hoe go
The beat hit like Beat Street, Krush Groove and Breakin' (Wailin')
Never bakin', rebukin' Satan, we had you waitin'

It was swinging, my arms bugging, adrenaline pumping
Oh shit, this little nigga's thugging
I mean, I was thirteen, I was nursing a knot on my face
But chose another time and a place
That I would avenge my last fight cuz the same shit
Ain't gonna happen that just happened last night
Knuckle game changed quicker than lightning
Hit 'em or slice 'em
Either stick 'em or blast pipes, it's the fastlife
I try to give another nigga advice, shoot dice
Do plenty of shit cause this life, how many you get?
How many niggas do you know get two?
Besides a nigga who snitch to skip a life-bid, be one a' your crew
I don't respect killers, I respect O.G. knowledge
Codes of the streets got new rules, but no guidance
Lessons, detrimental to a young disciple
Focus, take care of your brothers, niggas do as I do
Keep your enemies close, where they can see you
It's not your enemy who get you
It's always your own people"

Yo, my balls and my word is alls I have
What you gonna do to me, nigga? Scars'll scab

Scarface	11	Fuck Faces	My Homies	1998	[Verse 1]	"Man, I met this chick so fine
So bad she made me sick sometimes
I just had to fuck this bitch one time
I met her in The Galleria shopping
Buying gifts for some guy that she dating, still jocking
Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that
But man she had an ass so fat
You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands
It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants
Walked behind her whispering love songs, she started smiling
So I handed her this bathing suit, and told her ""Try it""
Replied, ""Why?"" with light brown eyes
""I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size""
She put it on so I paid for it, and then I told her she could keep it
Then I walked out the store, it's our secret
But peep it, made it down the hall, she came running
Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning
I've done it, made mack move with girl chasing me
And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces
It's tasteless, but honey must've missed being treated
Like something more than niggas just humping and dudes beating
Her ass behind the silly shit
And I can see it in her eyes, she was sick of this
Let's see the sights, it's me tonight
Let's leave him stuck home pacing
Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces"

I kick a bitch in the ass and then smoke
I'm a motherfucking fool in the pool doing the breaststroke
You want a problem? Well let's go
Cause if not, I came to disco
And freak this ho from Acapulco
And flip her inside out, now I'm bout to ride out
Let's go we hit the hood slow
Post up, set up shop and press four
Who got the best flow, who got the most dough
Who got the best hoes, nigga you know
Shit it's been ten years since I hit some cess smoke
But I still rock a mink coat on the West Coast in the summertime
And I crumble mine down to the dandelion
Nigga watch how I handle mine
Spiritual, hear we go, hear this
Snoop D-O-double-G, man I'm so fearless
Square biz, you know what time it is
I'm cool on these niggas but I'm hard on a bitch

Put your back out, now back in
Go head wiggle it round you feeling me now
Girlfriend, you killing them now"

Lost too many soldiers not to play it safe

You know that one auntie, you don't mean to be rude
But every holiday, nobody eating her food
And you don't wanna stay there 'cause them your worst cousins
Got roaches at they crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousin

We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are
Feel like a million dollars, feel me holla
To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas
Thugs in renta's, to the playas and ballers

I ain't acid rap, but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops, is that a subliminal hint? No
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No, Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again, then if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up on the tenth (Ah)
Bitch, I'ma kill you
I ain't done, this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it
Three or four times in a tub, but that's normal, ain't it, Norman?

And then she went and gave her homeboy Ted some head
I ain't tellin' on her, I'm just sayin'
What you do?
When your bitch out of bounds and you don't know what to do
What we do?

I wake up the birds, so when the nerds asleep
I'm catching my second wind the second the first one ends
I am focused, man, and I'm not afraid of death
I'm going all out, I circle the vultures in a van and
I run the block (Run), pull up in a drop (Pull up)
Push up on my money (Push up), I'm in great shape, dunny (Woo)
I keep jacks jumping, thirty-six sets
Like a personal trainer, I teach coke to stretch
I pump in Roc sweats, all-white trainers
The ghetto's Billy Blanks, I show you niggas what pain is
Maintain your stamina, Hov will damage ya
Spot you two rhymes, y'all niggas is amateurs
The fifth a deadlift
If niggas don't wanna get shot, then y'all niggas better squat
I drop your set for rep
No need to hit the showers, the spit from the fifth leave you wet

And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me, but
My name is Windy and I like to blow trees,"" and
From that point, I'd never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me"""

I'm a professional when I become sexual

Don't it sound like phone sex, kinky, when I talk switch the slang
Hard to tell that nigga from New York, shorty
Come ride on my roller coaster
Porn star stamina, I try not to damage her (haha)
Unlimited tongue action 'til you're climaxing
Foreplay, you can have it your way
I follow directions, whoa, you're jiggling baby
Back shots have your whole bed wiggling crazy

I have you saying, ""slow down baby"""

Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga"

Kanye West	5	Dark Fantasy	My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy	2010	[Bridge]	"At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents

Saw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris"
Travis Scott	33	3500	Rodeo	2015	[Chorus]	"Sundays in the city movin' slow

Lupe Fiasco	23	SEATTLE	DRILL MUSIC IN ZION	2022	[Verse 2]	"To see my vampires in the sunlight
To look my eye, right in the suns
And bring all my knives to the gunfights
One life, live a hundred ways
But never break it down like gum bites
If done right, you'll be unliked, but you'll be unlike
When you gotta run where snares on the drum type
Where they hung whites, psych
Where they hung blacks
Even hung like a black life is a batch, don't come twice
You could light a fire with a thumb swipe but you need a lighter
If you got the motion, but none of the components
Then it's karaoke and it don't really matter if it's sung nice"
Lloyd Banks	34	P.I.M.P. Remix (Edited Version)	Get Rich or Die Tryin’	2003	[Verse 3]	"You need to switch over and ride with a star, it'll get you far
I'm a P-I-M-P, G-A-N-G-S-T-E-R, yeah, I'm young but I ain't dumb
They're some tricks but I ain't one, I'm a guerrilla for scrilla, I'll trip you, you try to run
I let 'em do as they please, as long as they get my cheese
Even if they gotta freeze or if it's a hundred degrees
I keep 'em on they knees, take a look under my sleeve
I ain't gotta give 'em much, they happy with Mickey D's, pimp"

Rakim	10	I’ll Be There	The Master	1999	[Verse 1]	"I'm bout to meet my comrade on the busy Ave where we clash
Trying to see how much gritty cash this city has
Meantime harass every bitty that pass
And then here you come with your pretty ass
All petite like you make ends meet on Wall Street
Your for keeps couldn't find a woman more complete
You got your head on tight and when you talk I like
For me and you two different walks of life
I'm in the streets too much I pack the heat too much
Put too much trees in the Dutch and don't keep in touch
You try to get in contact I don't respond back
Where the god at come back smellin' like cognac
Baby beware I'm tryin' my best to be fair
Aye yo-the key here is repair this love we share
Cause if we care we would prepare to see clear
Eye to eye we here as long as you be there"
Common	22	Food for Funk	One Day It’ll All Make Sense	1997	[Verse 2]	"Some niggas be on the mic, sounding like dikes
Allow me to get on and bust like Spike(uh)
Lee, I'm in the majors with no rotation
Through stations of bullshit, I see through like a pager
In the age of Aquarius, various things
Is gonna carry us in intellect and what have you
Street astrologists interpret point stars and half moons
Then end up on garages or walls in bathrooms
Every black moon, a rap tune move me
The rap sun, I rain more than Rudy, that unruly shit is played
It don't stop
It's time to get it, get it made
I got my mind made up like Foxy Brown's face
I know how the underground tastes
I want a crib from the ground up, rooms spin at a round pace
Get down based on true story, through Corey, came close to the teachers
Colder as the Iceman, posted before it start wrinklin
Linkin with cats, who don't react to change in the years
Fulfill prophesies in rooms full of emptiness, now"

Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out (Out)
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more 'cause my dick all in her mouth (Mouth)
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating in the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on? You keep on singin' the same song
Let bygones be bygones and you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama"
Snoop Dogg	0	Snoopafella	No Limit Top Dogg	1999	[Verse 3]	"I jumped in the low-low and went on my way
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say
It was after eleven when I rocked the mic
And by the time I left the stage, the people were hyped (well alright!)
The princess was starin, while holdin a drank
Reflected from her eyes was gold tank
She waved her hands like, ""Hello! Hi!""
Then gave another gesture like, ""Come here, guy!""
I left the stage, girls came in flocks
The bitch was swingin from the hard knocks
I heard a sound, not a tick nor tock
Gong! First bell before twelve o'clock
No time to waste, I broke out in haste
The princess followed in a futile chase
A quick steady pace is what I kept
Lost one of my Chucks on one of those steps
For the six-fo' I continued my stride
About this time I heard gong five
I was down the block when I heard gong eight
And the princess screamed out, ""Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!"""

There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out (Thangs out)
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfuckin' tape in court
I'll kill you, I ain't playin'
Hear what I'm sayin', homie, I ain't playin'
Catch you slippin', I'ma kill you, I ain't playin'
Hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playin'"

Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, ""Baby, please don't leave!""
But you left and you took everything I had left

Y'all can go half on a sample platter you can have with cheese
Battered covered data with the added tees
Giant leaps, beware where that landing ladder leads
'Cause you can walk up there
But don't take off your mask, and try and talk up there, yeah
'Cause ain't no screams in space
Egyptian museum, they keep the kings in crates
Thrones out on loan and they keep their rings in safes
You decide, apple pie or the fries come with the snake
Prosperous gospel, got choirs all on the case
Poverty pimpin' angel wings, flies all on her face
Wave a K until they die and then ride all on their wake
Shooting Trakk on the track, I ride all on the freights
Like I'm shoestring, they say you can't escape when rich
It's just a bigger plate, they catching bait with fish"

Want a description? My royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can't be no minus
Went from yelling crickets and crows
Bitches and hoes to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes, and yes, I seen thangs
Like Kilroy, chill boy, because them folks might think you soft
Talking like that, man, fuck them niggas, I'm going off
And coming right back like boomerangs when you throw 'em
With these old ghetto poems, thinking it's better for 'em
When they can let they thumb down from hitchhiking
Inviting niggas into the temple they call their body
Now everybody got it, had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Coming around my crew looking Jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes, even Bo knew that you got poked
Like acupuncture patients
While our nation is a boat, straight sinking
I hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chill'un
They fucking a different nigga every time they get the feeling to
I'm willing to go the extra kilometer
Just to see my señorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no girl ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it's real Jazzy Belle"

Louis Vuitton kicks, Louis Vuitton frames on

And say goodbye to the '6-4, hello to the '6-trey
He ain't never seen hydraulics, look at his bitch face
Up, down, now watch my shit scrape
Daz call Snoop, I'ma Crip Walk to get Dre
And Blood Bounce back, heat on the track
Dribble rock like Wade and bounce like Shaq
Throw a O in the pot and watch it bounce right back
Like that (Like that?) Like that"
Havoc	7	Quiet Storm (Remix)	Murda Muzik	1999	[Verse 1]	"Yo, blowin' niggas with rusty-ass German things
Keepin' it thorough is our motherfuckin' claim to fame
Throw on your wetsuit, when it rains it pours and all
Hit 'em with the four
Don't even know him from a hole in the wall
Get at me, niggas wanna clap me
Snitches wanna rat me? Put it right where they back be
Keep my Dunns close to me, enemies even closer
Sendin' kites with the Motorolas, yo
Give 'em the cold shoulder with a hollow-tip to match
Bad apple outta the batch, obsessed with gats
Since a little dude, eating niggas food buck-fifty's
Niggas can kill me but they comin' wit me
How about that, send the Queen Bee to attack
Only a fly bitch like that can leave em relaxed
Rock 'em to sleep, make 'em think the drama is dead
Yo, I smile up in your face though I'm plottin' instead (uhh, uhh)"

Where your ass was at, dog, when I was drinking Hi-Tech?
Where your ass was at, dog? You came through the projects
Where your ass at? We keep that fully loaded contracts
Had her rain dance on the dick, ass jumping
Running through the pussy like a nigga going jogging
Fuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the 'gram, now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco
12 tryin' come in the spot to open up the dope
Burglar bar doors got a young nigga confident
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion"

I been stomped out in front of my mama
My daddy commissary made it to commas
Bitch, all my grandmas dead
So ain't nobody prayin' for me, I'm on your head, ayy
Thirty millions later, know the feds watchin'
Auntie on my Telegram like, ""Be cautious!""
I be hangin' out at Tam's, I be on Stockton
I don't do it for the 'Gram, I do it for Compton
I'm willin' to die for this shit, nigga
I'll take your fuckin' life for this shit, nigga

50 Cent	19	I’m Supposed To Die Tonight	The Massacre	2005	[Verse 2]	"In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
Big said, ""Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
And pray for my downfall,"" I understand it all
But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga
I'm on that Kevlar vest shit, that Wild Wild West shit
There's 81 one karat stones in my necklace
I shine so hard, I make motherfuckers wan' kill me
Every projects in every hood I go, they feel me
Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B
I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy
When I come out to play, and my mob ain't with me
You can bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy, frontin' on me'll shorten your lifespan
Hold the mic with my left, my knife in my right hand
Yeah!"

Comin' with a grip of gangsta shit for '93
So '94's arrived, nigga, back on up
And let me and my dog Kurupt fuck shit up
Now can't nobody see me here or there, wherever I bails
I put it down all around, 'cause ain't shit for sale
In the coupe with the beat, flossin' off gold Ds
And my cousin Snoop packs well, you know what I mean
And it don't take much for Tha Dogg Pound to bust a cap
In your ass, for gettin' us all fucked up, now check it
It's a fallout for niggas like those
Who supposed to be the shit, but steadily bitchin' like hoes
Yes, y'all, walk the dogs, yes, y'all, yiggy-y'all
Stay full of that gin and juice and have a ball"

Havoc	7	Survival of the Fittest	The Infamous	1995	[Verse 2]	"I'm trapped in between two worlds, tryin' to get dough
Y'know, when the dough get low, the jewels go
But never that! As long as fiends smoke crack
I'll be on the block hustlin', countin' my stacks
No doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution
Five-O lurkin', no time to get lost in the system
Niggas usin' fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
I live a world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin, when he got bagged, that fucked me up, God
But shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples when you're Upstate bleedin'
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
Hit with a two-to-four is difficult
Wild on the streets, I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, ‘cause hoes like to run game
Some niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit
I'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip
Pushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get, I'm stayin' in the projects forever!
Jakes on the blocks — we out-clever
If beef, we never separate, roll together
When worst comes to worst, my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot
Fuck lookin' cute! I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits
Puffin' L's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell
In the 'Bridge, gettin' down, it ain't hard to tell
You better realize"

And how I became hooked on Va-aliu-um
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank, fuckin' peas in my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So every day I'd have at least three stomachaches
Now tell me, what kind of mother would want to see her
Son grow up to be an undera-fuckin'-chiever?
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothin' either
""What the fuck you stickin' gum up under the fuckin' seat for?""
""Mrs. Mathers, your son has been huffin' ether
Either that or the motherfucker's been puffin' reefer""
But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
It was neither, I was buzzin' but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a teacup? Bitch, you ain't my keeper, I'm sleepin'
What the fuck you keep on fuckin' with me for?
Slut, you need to leave me the fuck alone, I ain't playin'
Go find you a white crayon and color a fuckin' zebra!"

Don't get excited, you've been invited to a quiet storm
But now it's out of hand 'cause you told me you hate me
And then you ask what have I done lately
First you said all you want is love and affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
Take you out, buy you all kinds of things
Make— Make 'em— Make 'em clap to this
Caught an attitude, you need food to eat up

You scream I'm lazy, you must be crazy

I say what I want cause I can
If I didn't I'd be a liar, mami I'm on fire
Come ride with a rider, I travel
So you might catch the King with a singer
But touching my doorbell's the only way I put a ring on your finger
Threw me a combo with two cups and
I'm in your bedroom fuckin' up your sheets like the Klu Klux Klan
I shake hands with my fans and fuck 'em
I'm in the hallways tryin' to duck 'em, so I can climb in sum'n

Big Pun	24	Twinz (Deep Cover ’98)	Capital Punishment	1998	[Verse 5]	"Fuck the police, I squeeze first, make 'em eat dirt
Take 'em feet-first through the morgue, then lodge 'em in the deep earth
The street's cursed, the First Amendment's culturally biased
Supposed to supply us with rights, tonight, I hold my rosaries tight as I can
I'm one man against the world
Just me and my girl — Black Pearl Latina, más fina, but keeps it real
You know the deal, we steal from the rich and keep it
Peep it, it's no secret, watch me and Joe go back and forth and freak it"

Nas	9	N.Y. State of Mind	Illmatic	1994	[Verse 1]	"Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm, I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a .9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers ""Back up!"" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck!""
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind"
Kendrick Lamar	16	On Me	The Documentary 2	2015	[Outro]	"On me, that's on me

Dr. Dre	1	Deep Water	Compton	2015	[Verse 1]	"I heard you talking about respect, I gave you niggas the utmost
All you niggas the utmost
Would you look over Picasso's shoulder
And tell him 'bout his brush strokes?
Them opinions, I don't trust those
I apologize, the city made a nigga so cutthroat
Every hood love me, but it started on one coast
Could've stopped in '86 but I knew that you would want more
I'm on the throne in a place some niggas won't go"

Not only a client, the Presidito, hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped ""Jesus Walks"" now I'm on the steeple
And we know, ""New Jack City""—got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'ma beat my brother
On that ""Diamonds"" remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammys I said, ""I inspired me""
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll
'Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gonna mingle, yo, heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like, ""Damn, no way""
Translate, español: ""No way, José""
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gon' come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse"

Snoop Dogg	0	G Bedtime Stories	No Limit Top Dogg	1999	[Verse]	"Great scotts, it's hot today
He ran up out of bullets so I shot him in his chest
He fell to the floor with his hands in the air
His vision gettin blurry but you know I didn't care
Peck, peck, he tried to stay on deck
So I ran up on this nigga and I shot him in his neck
Shooting like a muthafuckin Vietnam vet
Riding on this nigga disrepectin my set
No stranger to danger ain't no warning shots
On the hood gettin hot, anybody can drop
You better have a spot up in town my nigga
Cause please believe it, it can go down my nigga
Caught up in some traffic behind some hood rat
Grease strikes you out with no get back
Wishing for a steak eatin on a Kit Kat
And your bitch ain't shit the little homie hit that
Sit back and go see, take a trip up with me
Let's go get a stick nigga dip with me
We can ride on some niggas for nuthin at all
Even if we cool with 'em, fuck 'em let's go get 'em
LBC in this muthafucka cuz
I had to show these niggas what time it was
We got thugs, cons, drugs and guns
We claiming everything nigga, even dimes and doves
Have you ever slapped a bitch, to mack your grip?
Or better yet, strapped a clip to a muthafuckin' nine millimeter for heater and put the ride down out a G two seater?
You need a nigga like me to get your game like that
Young nigga, you could get a smack for that
I'm that nigga who brought the afro back
And pat your back and then I turn around and snatch your sack
Before I came out niggas was wearing slack
I brought the curl back and the golf hat
The black poker sack and this scandalous raps
The one eight seven kidnaps and jacks
I brought snaps to the game nigga
Raps to the game nigga, I'm that big rap name nigga
S-N double O-P fa sho
I do my thang way cutthroat on the down-low
Oh once upon a time in the LBC
There lived a OG from the DPG
And all the little kids looked up to him
All the women stayed true to him, police tried to do him
But couldn't do nothing to him cause he's like stainless steel
And all they hated on him because he was way to real
I don't know why but he's just so fly
But I gotta end this story by saying goodnight"
Common	22	Making a Name for Ourselves	One Day It’ll All Make Sense	1997	[Verse 1]	"Yo, yo
I can tell by how you write, you the type to run in a fight
I hold mics while you hold spite
Like a broken-hearted bitch
Don't give no fuck who your team or who you started with
Cameoed or charted with, I house niggas like apartments with
Mic mechanisms, I dissect the rhythm
Move crowds with kinetic wisdom
It's like a Malcolm X-orcism, fuck the rhythm, I hit him
I want him got and I get him
Auction his wack ass off, then bid him"
2Pac	18	Guess Who’s Back	Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...	1993	[Verse 1]	"Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
Two minutes to bounce, and every second counts
Better press REC on your deck
Here we go, set? Pass the Moët
My trickery's more slippery when wet
Wicked as I flip, don't trip, get a grip
It'll kick, if the bassline's thick, it's a hit
Everybody's got a mic now, it's like a hobby
But more like a job, 'cause bootleggers tryin' to rob me!
And little man wants to be a rap, star
Make papes, hit skins, drive a fat car
It ain't easy, sleaaaazy even
Deceivin' those we believe in
No benefits, just tricks and chicks
Knock a pig to pick, so here's a stick to lick
I shoot a gift, til there ain't none left
And if I find that the track sound def
I catch wreck till I lose my breath
That's how it goes in the land of broke
I dispose of those, rock shows, and collect my dough
Now I suppose I'm the bad guy, why?
I say, ""Hi,"" and try to stay high
Life's a mess don't stress, test
Of givin but be thankful that you're livin', blessed
Guess who's back, comin back with the track supplied
By Special Ed and Ak, comin' right and exact
I'm fightin' it back but now I snap, where they at?
When it's time to go to combat, guess who's back"

Any drama, I'm locked on like a red-nose pit
Keep shooting them cap guns with the red nose tips
Have some Cali niggas come out and dead those strips
Give a fuck if you tough nigga, or you buff nigga
My 4-5 weigh 3 pounds and it'll snuff niggas
Hop out the truck with the gun so long
Let the bullets jump out and ask, ""What's going on?""
What the fuck can I say? I grew up a bastard
Got sick of the Impala so I threw up a Aston
I pop big shit, and I keep my wrist lit
My entourage shine like the Diamond District
I got a Rolex, a real big Rolex
With so many rocks, the Africans is trying to protest
Bully of the block, why? Cus they got me top 5
There's four niggas better than me? Nigga, stop lyin!"
Gang Starr	21	Tonz ‘O’ Gunz	Hard to Earn	1994	[Verse 1]	"Tons o' guns are in the streets nowadays
It's big money and you know crime pays
Check your nearest overpopulated ghetto
They greet you with a pistol, not trying to say hello
Mad kids packed 'cause the neighborhood's like that
Want some shit that's fat, catch a victim, do a stick
Kids pulling triggers, niggas killing niggas
Five-o, they sit and wait and tally death-toll figures
It's crazy, there ain't no time to really chill
Jealous motherfuckers always wanna act ill
.22s, .25s, .44s, .45s
MAC-11s, AKs taking mad lives
What the fuck you gonna do in a situation?
It's like you need to have steel just to feel relaxation
Tons o' guns"

Eminem	15	White America	The Eminem Show	2002	[Verse 1]	"I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
Who would've thought standin' in this mirror, bleachin' my hair
With some peroxide, reachin' for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keep tellin' me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin' it on"

Ain't nobody black runnin' but crac-kers, so, why
I got to register? I thinkin' of better shit to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep-ass rhymes
So let me take y'all way
Back to when a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta, ayy
Y'all could not tell me nothin', thought I hit that bottom rock
At age thirteen, start workin' at that loadin' dock
They layin' my mama off of work, General Motors trippin'
But I come home banked like Hank from lickin' and dippin'
Doin' dumb shit, not knowin' what a nigga know now
Yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips over to East Point, still actin' a fool
Wastin' my time in the school, I'd rather be shootin' pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about mackin' hoes and wearin' pimp fades
Instead of bein' in class, I'd rather be up in some ass
Not thinkin' about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
Damn, that's fucked up, I should've listened when my mama told me
That if you play now, you're gonna suffer later
Figured she was talkin' yang-yang, so I payed her
No attention and kept missin' the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get, the more I'm feelin' broke as shit
Huh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-U-T-Kast
So get up off your ass"

Grab his fam, and run the train on his granddaughter
""Nah, chill, that's too ill, for real, I'd rather kill somethin'
Here's the deal, we shatter his grill, and drill fuck him
Oral torture, no doubt, the shit is holocaust
In two minutes tops, he's guaranteed to cop and give up all the morsels""
It's settled, better put on your metal, foot on the pedal
We got a half hour before the plan sours like Amaretto
Far from the ghetto, a rebel of chance, the devil in pants
Out for the fast cash, level advance
Takin' a chance, I've only got one, my hundred shot
Tommy shotguns my judge, jury and Johnny Cochran"
Scarface	11	G’s	The Diary	1994	[Verse 3]	"Formaldehyde smokin', niggas gettin' loc'ed and
Ready to pull your coat and leave your stomach open
Scopin', hopin' for you to fuck up and slip
So we can have a reason for fuckin' up your shit
(It ain't no motherfuckin' peace when they see me)
'Cause we never had a motherfuckin' peace treaty
So I know I got to get 'em with game
And when I hit 'em with the game I gotta hit 'em with this damn thang
'Cause it's kill or be killed, never cut slack
And if you cut slack, they bust back, fuck that
I never give a second chance to pull the first gun
'Cause if they bust one time, that be the worst one
And that's the one that can close the shop
So you gotta stand and hold the Glock

MC Ren	17	She Swallowed It	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Verse 2]	"Now one night I was at a drive-in
And a car full of niggas straight drove in
I thought they was comin' to start trouble, but no
Five niggas in a bucket with the neighborhood ho
Now what do you expect? They're gonna dog her like a doggy
Thirty minutes later and the windows all were foggy
And I'm off in my car havin' a fit 'cause the bitch that I'm with
Said no fuckin' on the first date shit
And I'm like damn, I wish I was in the bucket
To be the sixth nigga with the ho and I can fuck it
So I told the bitch I was with that I'm goin' to the snack bar
And got the fuck out the car
Went to the bucket and I looked through the window
It was some niggas that I knew, they let me in, yo
And my turn was like next
I couldn't see her face, all I saw was her pussy and her chest
I wanted to see the face, I felt I oughta
Peep over the seat, oh shit, it's the preacher's daughter
And she's only fourteen and a ho
But the bitch sucks dick like a specialized pro
She looked at me, I was surprised
But wasn't passin' up the chance of my dick gettin' baptized
I told the bitch to do it quick
You little ho, hurry up and suck my dick"

She went to sleep so my father said I could turn it up
What did he care? He in the bathroom sherm'n up
So I let that Dogg Pound rock
Let that Ice Cube knock 'til my sister pressed stop
Soon as she left out, like Diddy, I Pressed Play
That's when that Hard Knock Life, introduced me to Just Blaze
I would sit in my room and just blaze
Before chronic had all these funny names, it was just haze
No hash, 'cause it was just haze
And I would get so high, nigga, that I would just daze
I mean I was so amazed somethin' so fuckin green
Could turn this little-ass house into a maze
Chronic 2001 got me through my hardest days
And just think, my momma said marijuana was a phase"

Fuck apologies, I wanna see y'all geeked up
Don't acknowledge me, then maybe we can say it's fair
Take it to the internet and I'ma take it there
Miss my uncle Lil' Mane, he said that he would kill me if I didn't make it
Now I'm possessed by a spirit and they can't take it
Used to bump Tha Carter III, I held my Rollie chain proud
Irony, I think my hard work let Lil Wayne down
Whatever, though, call me crazy, everybody questionable
Turn me to an eskimo, I drew the line and decimals
Snoop posted ""Taylor Made,"" I prayed it was the edibles
I couldn't believe it, it was only right for me to let it go
Won the Super Bowl and Nas the only one congratulate me
All these niggas agitated, I'm just glad they showin' they faces
Quite frankly, plenty artists, but they outdated
Old-ass flows, tryna convince me that you they favorite
This is not for lyricists, I swear it's not the sentiments
Fuck a double entendre, I want y'all to feel this shit
Old soul, bitch, I probably built them pyramids
Ducking strays when I rap battled in the Nickersons
Where you from? Not where I'm from, we all indigenous
Against all odds, I squabbled up for them dividends
Against all odds, I showed up as a gentleman
I done lost plenty friends, sixteen to be specific
Put that on my kids' children, we gon' see the future first
They like, ""Dot big trippin',"" I just want what I deserve

You mad 'cause I was in the van with your bitch with both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne, that you know in your heart
I got style, plus the way that I be flowin' is sharp
A while back I used to hustle, sellin' blow in the park
Countin' G stacks and rockin' ice that glow in the dark
Forever hottie huntin', trigger temper, I'm quick to body somethin'
You lookin' at me like I'm probably frontin'
I fuck around and throw three in your chest and flee to my rest
I'm older and smarter, this is me at my best
I stopped hangin' around y'all
'Cause niggas like you be prayin' on my downfall, hopin' I flop
Hopin' I stop, you probably even hope I get locked
Or be on the street corner with a pipe, smokin' the rock
I got more riches than you, fuck more bitches than you
Only thing I haven't got is more stitches than you
Fuckin' punk, you ain't a leader, what? Nobody followed you
You was never shit, your mother should've swallowed you (Mmm, woo)
You on some tag-along, flunky yes-man shit
Do me a favor: please get off the next man dick
And if you think I can't fuck with whoever, put your money up
Put your jewels up, no, fuck it, put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up, nigga, or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead and make a lot of bloodshed
Turn your tux red, I'm far from broke, got enough bread
And mad hoes, ask Beavis, I get nothin' but head
My game is vicious and cruel, fuckin' chicks is a rule
If my girl think I'm loyal, then that bitch is a fool
How come you can listen to my first album
And tell where a lot of niggas got their whole style from? (Yeah)
So what you actin' for? You ain't half as raw, you need to practice more
Somebody tell this nigga somethin' 'fore I crack his jaw
You runnin' with boys, I'm runnin' with men, I'ma be rippin' the mics until I'm a hundred and ten
Have y'all niggas like, ""Dammit, this nigga done done it again""
I throw slugs at idiots, no love for city cops
I sport a pretty watch, eight hunnid and fifty rocks
I'm makin' wonderful figures, I don't fuck with none of you niggas
I might pull out this gun on you niggas and rob every last one of you niggas"

Puffing weed as I position myself to clock G's
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin'
Pockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches
Evading the playa hating tricks while hitting switches
Bitches is bad-mouth, ‘cause brawling motherfuckers is bold
But charge them hoes; the game should be sold
I'm sick of psychotic society, somebody save me
Addicted to drama, so even Mama couldn't raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
I run in the streets and puffing weed with my peeps
I'm duckin' the cops, I hit the weed as I'm clutchin' my Glock
Niggas is hot when I hit the block; what if I die tonight?"

Nowadays I throw shots back, leavin' nothin' to waste
Life's like a treadmill, niggas runnin' in place
Gettin' nowhere fast, a whole year done past
I vowed to never stop winnin', 'til the earth stop spinnin'
Rock hot linen, cop hot cars and hot women
If it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not rememberin'
My motto is, simply ""I will not lose!""
Abide by the block rules, I buy my Glocks used
With bodies on it, let me know anybody want it?
I'm raised, irrational, ways misunderstood
If you ain't live like I live, then one with the hood
I done what I could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still
Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature
If hell awaits a, nigga I'm comin' with the razors
Still flashin' ya shit, try to pass me in a six

This is, not a game this is not why I came
May these words find a spot on your brain and burn
Then I recycle my life, I shall return"

Eminem	15	No Regrets	Music to Be Murdered By	2020	[Verse 1]	"Yeah, they miss the old me
I think they want me to OD on codeine
They want my life in turmoil like in '03
They want front row seats, I give 'em nosebleeds
They want me imploding, exploding, self-loathing, eroding
I'm screaming at 'em with no regrets and I'm hulking
I'm rippin' out of my clothing
I had to go see the doc like Kool Moe Dee (Yeah)
Never took much to convince Dre
Never been swayed by color or skin shades
Since day one, Hellraiser with twin blades of a sensei
Givin' up, no comprende (Woo)
Tin brain, prolly fucked in the membrane
Slim Sha— mind's in the gutter, but insane
Pen game like I just struck in the tenth frame
Yeah, I live on the edge, I sit on the ledge
To shit on your heads, I been on the bench
Forgive and forget is the only thing I'd ever live to regret
Hell-bent on revenge, you left me for dead
I crawled out my grave, you better be ready and set
My enemies ain't put an end to me yet"

This little nigga named Nas think he live like me
Talkin' 'bout he left the hospital, took five like me
You live in fantasies, nigga, I reject your deposit
We shook Dre punk ass, now he outta the closet
Mobb Deep wonder why nigga blowed 'em out
Next time grown folks talkin', nigga close your mouth
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real players fall to let these bitch niggas beat me
Puffy, let's be honest, you a (you a sucker ass nigga) punk or you will see me wit gloves
Member that shit you said to Vibe about me bein' a thug?
And you can tell the people you roll wit whatever you want
But you and I know what's goin' on
Payback, I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witnessed me strapped with MAC's, knew I wouldn't play that
All you old rappers tryin' to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man
Niggas lookin' like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick

Tryna player hate on my shit, you eat a fat dick
Let it be known, this is how you made me
Lovin' how I got you niggas crazy"
Eminem	15	If I Had	The Slim Shady LP	1997	[Verse 1]	"I'm tired of backstabbin'-ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committin' so many sins
Tired of always givin' in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never havin' any ends
Tired of havin' skinny friends hooked on crack and Mini Thins
I'm tired of this DJ playin' your shit when he spins
Tired of not havin' a deal
Tired of havin' to deal with the bullshit without grabbin' the steel
Tired of drownin' in my sorrow
Tired of havin' to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers sprayin' shit and dartin' off
I'm tired of jobs startin' off at $5.50 an hour
Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off
Tired of bein' fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of havin' to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk, breathin' down my neck, drivin' me berserk
I'm tired of usin' plastic silverware
Tired of workin' at Builder's Square, tired of not bein' a millionaire"
JAY-Z	6	99 Problems	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 2]	"The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, ""Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?""
""'Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?""
""Well, you was doing fifty-five in a fifty-four
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are""
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit
""Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?""
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
""Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?""
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
""Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!""
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!"
The Game	13	State of Emergency	LAX	2008	[Verse 3]	"Call the U.S. government and tell em it's a motherfuckin code red
Niggas tried to straight up jack me, now they both dead
Third little nigga got away on his moped
Caught him 'round the corner, put the beam on his forehead
Jumped in the Impala then smashed through the light
Without a one time in sight
So I bust a right on Century, headed to the L.A.X
Where there ain't nothin but fly bitches and jets
In and out of lanes and I almost wrecked
Off brand nigga in the 600 throwin up his set
He must don't know I got the 40 on deck
And the TEC tryna be Shabba Ranks, time to flex
It's the third this shit happened to me all day
Guess it's time to add another dead body to the throw away
So I turned down my Spice 1 tape
And hit the switch, emptied the whole clip in his fuckin face"

You either gon' be dead or in jail, killer psychology
Silent murderer, what's your body count? Who your sponsorship?
Objectified so many bitches, I killed their confidence (What the—)
The media's the new religion, you killed the consciousness (What the fuck?)
Your jealousy is way too pretentious, you killed accomplishments (What the fuck?)
Niggas killed freedom of speech, everyone sensitive (What the fuck?)
If your opinion fuck 'round and leak, might as well send your will (What the—)
The industry has killed the creators, I'll be the first to say (What the fuck?)
To each exec', ""I'm saving your children""—We can't negotiate (What the—)
I caught a couple of bodies myself, slid my community
My last Christmas toy drive in Compton handed out eulogies
Not because the rags in the park had red gradient
But because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin'
So what's the difference 'tween your life when hiding motives?
More fatalities and reality bring you closure
The noble person that goes to work and pray like they 'posed to?
Slaughter people too, your murder's just a bit slower"
Sleepy Brown	29	Peaches	Idlewild	2006	[Chorus]	"Stages in life, no one said that it was right

When her and Suzy, yeah, they threw a slumber
Party, but you can not call it that 'cause it was slummer
Well, it was more like spend the night
Three in the mornin', yawnin', dancin' under street lights
We chillin' like a villain, and a nigga feelin' right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite all of the bullshit
We on our back, starin' at the stars above (Aww, man)
Talkin' bout what we gonna be when we grow up (Mm)
I said, ""What you wanna be?"" She said, ""Alive""
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown
I came back home to find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mama said she with a nigga that be treatin' her wrong (Man)
I kept on singin' my song and hopin' at a show
That I would one day see her standin' in the front row
But two weeks later, she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due
Sasha Thumper"

Two old friends, why panic? You already know
Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats, MCs don't see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me

Into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here

You dealin' with, ain't nutty but the study gon' unveil
My relative in jail, ha! Stay engaged
To whatever make money, now he married to that cage
Divorce is not an option and prenuptial is void
Eat up whatever rapper, but I'm tangled in my cord (Hum)
Bored, kind of like a knight with the sword
Without dragon to battle, so I'm running from a shadow
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat!
The damsels in distress, but they a mess
They only like my armor, and that I'm a performer
They read one magazine and wanna think they getti'n warmer
They only gettin' colder, hell, maybe I should throw
A double diamond party in the North Pole
Invite all the writers and journalists
Even biters will tournament, to see who can be me
Better than me, it's a permanent, smile on my face
Because you said you don't like my style
But that's okay, but just make sure you don't touch that dial
And we'll be cool, touch it and you's a fool
Look, I'll get you hooked, y'all crooks might even move
To Atlanta, Georgia, get a wife and daughter
Start a new life, and all that wrong you do you'll make it right
But, hell, all a dream, I wear the crown, I'm king
Respect is mandatory, end of the story, go fly a kite
Category, ain't got none, you know I'm right"

Before you hear this, rewind this, 4 minutes before we timeless
Let y'all niggas bang my shit before Saddam hits
Let Nastradamus tell us what time it is
They try to buy us with dough
Fake black leaders of puppets always talkin' 'bout the city budget
The news got it all confused, lyin' to the public
They eyes watchin', stay wise, move above it
Water floods predicted, hurricanes, twisters
It's all signs of the Armageddon, three sixes
People verse the system, politics verse religion
Holy war, Muslim verse Christian
Niggas in high places, they don't got the balls for this
People in power sit back and watch them slaughter us

Because right or left could mean life or death
No matter how trife it get, my sights is set
But it's twice the threat when the nights is death
My mental windows refuse to close, they get exposed
To the neighborhood info where the poison wind blows
A deadly plague spreadin' negativity, viciously
Unto every city be in ghetto misery
Don't let it get to me, the writer be left to die
But it get mesmerize if it catch your eye
Shine's enormous, from jewellery, vehicles and garments
But it's torment, jealousy, drug wars or warrents
Tallyin', slowly turnin' into barbarians
More scary when the whole boulevard's carryin'
Livin' in the world of sin, my ghetto girls and men
Waitin' for the world to end"

I wouldn't stand a chance of tryin' to sell like Shady
If I put out bullshit joints like AZ
Every chance niggas get, they'd try and play me
But I move around with a little .380
A nigga try to stunt, a nigga get sprayed B
If I smoked weed all day like Snoop do
I'd see the world different through my dilated pupils

Those cellophane ones, the ones that you can see through
It's poetic justice 'cause I'm mad with a pact
So precise, my insight will take flight in the night
And in the daytime 'cause I don't come up with corny rhymes
I'm too devoted to the concept of gettin' mine

You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I pull a number like a pager
‘Cause I'mma ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is givin' me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change
I'm a performer, strange, show the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime"

I put chumps to rest fast when my Smith Wes' blast
So just dash, or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don't get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go berserk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smoke 'cause these knuckles hurt
I'm from the alley, not the valley, I'm hotter than Cali
Wicked like Harry and fuck Sally, I'd rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles, don't hang with jive pals
Adios, ghost, I'm five thous'"

Producer made him take it down, said he had to pay
Open mic champ two weeks in a row
Ex D-boy with a B-boy flow
Glow like Leroy, you should see boy go
Got a daddy serving life and a brother on the row
Best homie in the grave, tatted up while in the cage
Minute Maid got his momma working like a slave
Down baby mama who he really had to honor
‘Cause she was his biggest fan, even let him use her Honda
To drive up to Dallas, went to open up for amateurs
Let him keep a debit card so he could put gas in it
Told her when he get on, he gon' take her to the Galleria
Buy her everything but the mannequins, ya dig?"

And shit from a sucka's put in a pot and I'll boil it
Turn up the pilot as it burns
And maybe, the muthafuckaz will learn
I'm not a sub, 'cause I speak sensible
Not considered a prince, 'cause I'm a principal
I'm engineerin' the shit that you're hearin'
'Cause when it comes to power, I'm power-steerin'
Silly, you say? I say you're silly when you say it
Rushin' to the eject to put my shit in and play it
It's like Apollo, but I'm not an amateur
And I'm not givin' a fuck while I'm damagin' ya
It's for the record — so Ren's lyrics is gonna spin it
And if there was a trophy involved, I'd win it
Possession is mine and I'm the holder
'Cause a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck 'cause I'm older
So for you to step off would be wise
And say fuck it! Parental discretion is advised"

Big Pun	24	Punish Me	Capital Punishment	1998	[Verse 1]	"I was the luckiest man on Earth, my wisdom was worth
Any purse but had a curse that hurt worse than giving birth
My first verse explains some of the games she was playing
I'm blaming myself 'cause in my wealth was where her pain would haven
Behaving like a money-hungry hooker
Funny how the money took her from a average honey to a stunning looker
I look back and reminisce how we used to kiss and smash hips in the GS I bought her last Christ'
She got too big for her britches but The Bridge is Over
Not the one in Queens, I mean the one she dreaming wasn't sober
Told her how I felt, gassed me when she cried for help
Supplied the guilt trip and I was whipped without a fucking belt
I felt stupid, Cupid struck me with a poison arrow
Should have drowned you when I found you crushing in my boy's Camaro
I didn't bother but you probably find your lover dead
You robbed me of my honor, ""
You ""ain't shit"" like my mother said"

Gotta get a tight grip, don't slip; loose lips sink ships
It's a trip, I love the way she licks her lips, see me jockin'
Put a little twist in her hips ‘cause I'm watchin'
Conversations on the phone 'til the break of dawn
Now we're all alone, why the lights on?
Turn them off! Time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Somethin' is on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well, if I couldn't have it (Silly rabbit) why you sweatin' me?
It's a lot of real Gs doin' time
'Cause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy, baby, if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
'Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clowned, baby doll are you down?
I get around"

Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealin’ with cold thumb
I’m willin' to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from

You ain't never been dropped off in the jungles

Stopped at the Wiener Schnitzel, got socked in the jaw
By some sixties, I bombed back, the nigga pulled out
A strap, said it's 6-0, I ducked then he missed me
Now I'm back to Bompton
Before I hit the hood, a nigga gotta stop in the Swans
And pick up a sack, had fifty for an eighth
And I only had fifty, made it last all day

Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more

Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said (They said...)
An escape route they used to escape out

Any good grinds, the world was theirs, ugh!

Hazard lights blinkin', gators hit the floor
Everybody watch the red carpet entrance, cameras flashin'
Just to think, that was yesterday's action
'Cause today goes either way, we came a long way
From hallway steps and hand-me-down shit
Fuck my foes, I seen the other side, Nextel cell roam
Call the chopper phone, heliport in my home
Quincy Jones posters, wake up, guns under my pillow
I can't talk around chauffeurs
Shit is better than a novel, autobiographic
Spit it on tracks, it becomes classic
Start some, make my heart pump, spark one, I'm God son
Nastradamus, last one to blast when the narcs come
Know how to leave anything in thirty seconds
When you feel the heat comin' and flee with the murder weapon

If I die today I'm happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts, I done been in 'em by myself
Locked up, I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now shit changed, motherfucker, I can hire some help
I done heard about the fifty grand you put in the hood
But your shooter finna get shot, it won't do him no good
With a pistol, I define the definition of pain
If you survive, your bones'll still fucking hurt when it rains
Oh, you a pro at playing Battleship? Well, this ain't the same
Little homie, this is a whole different type of war game
See, the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains
Or laid out in the street, leaking out they brains"

In Klein's green 5, until the cops pulled guns
And I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need -
What the game did to my pulse - with no results
And you can treat your nose and still won't come close
The game is a light bulb with eleventy-million volts
And I'm just a moth addicted to the floss
The doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
By any means necessary, whatever the cost
Even if it means lives is lost
And I can't explain why I just love to get high
Drink, ""life!"" smoke the blueberry sky, blink twice
I'm in the blueberry 5, you blink three times
I may not even be alive
I mean even James Dean couldn't escape the allure
Dying young, leaving a good-looking corpse
Of course..."

Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance"

Scarface	11	Safe	The Fix	2002	[Verse 2]	"I'm bout my paper, these other niggas slang for the sport
Like unaware tomorrow ain't promised, the game is too short
I've witnessed niggas get it all and give it away
Gettin back was out of the question, they lived for today
Then the hunger pains start up, then the murderous plots
To set up, they fuckin homeboy to get what he got
I mean the ones he broke the bread with, the ones you don't want
To be the ones fuckin your girlfriend the moment you out
I know the street game backwards, forwards, sideways
It used to be an honest hustle back then but nowadays
It's cutthroat, that's fucked up, niggas want they come up
So bad they'll take the .357 and smoke they brother
A damn shame; but, that's the way the game go
A chance niggas is takin especially if they slang dope
I've been in that position, back in the day
In fear of my homie hittin' my head to crack in my safe
And that's when"

And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothers'd still be virgins if crack never came out
I got the wild style, always been a foul child
My guns go ""boom-boom"" and your guns go ""pow-pow""
I'm known to have a hottie open, I keep the shotty smokin'
Front, and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to gettin' nookie I'm not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopi
I run with sturdy cliques, I'm never hittin' dirty chicks
Got thirty-five bodies, buddy, don't make it thirty-six
Step to this, you're good as gone
Word is born, I leave mics torn when I put it on"

Say she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Fridays, I still have it my way, gone!"
JAY-Z	6	Legacy	4:44	2017	[Verse 2]	"You see, my father, son of a preacher man
Whose daughter couldn't escape the reach of the preacher's hand
That charge of energy set all the Carters back
It took all these years to get to zero in fact
I hated religion 'cause here was this Christian
He was preachin' on Sundays, versus how he was livin' Monday
Someday I forgive him
'Cause strangely our division led to multiple religions
I studied Muslim, Buddhist, and Christians
And I was runnin' from him, He was givin' me wisdom
See how the universe works?
It takes my hurt and help me find more of myself
It's a gift and a curse
That's called the Red Queen's Race"

But I do remember your face from someplace this is one taste
Of Chicago, we got mo' many mo' many mo' many mo' flavors
Don't just come to me, go ask thy neighbor-I'm-a-hood takin niggas under
On the tundra, cause ""they're plain, they're plain""
I'm on a plateau that is fat so

Strong woman, why should you depend on a man?
I understand you want a man that's resourceful
If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you
Talking to a friend, about what love is
Her man didn't love her, 'cause he didn't love his
Hugged her from afar, said what I felt
You'll never find a man, 'til you find yourself
Time helps mistakes, you can learn from
One man F'd up, men you shouldn't turn from
You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too
At that destination, a king will anoint you
Going through the storm, many bodies seem warm
That relationship died, for you to be born, you're worth more
Than anything you could cop at a store
For you to grow, he had to go, so what you stoppin' him for?
Not even I could ignore being alone is hard
Find heaven in yourself and God
Find heaven in yourself and God, girl

Jetted up the staircase to the third floor
Reach behind the sink, throw the heater on the floor
Lock the door, police grab me up and try to break my jaw

It's a skeleton Audemars, but it still got emeralds in the face
Gotta go crazy with the cake
Call the plug, I'm pushin' weight
Sippin' on mud just ease the pain
The coupe go Porsche, just blow the brain
Trained to go, they ready to stain
Plush the seats inside the plane
Crank the charter, we goin' to Spain
We was starvin' before the fame
Tote a lil' carbon, don't explain
Exotic packs, we own the strain
Transactions, foreign exchange

Wisdom be leakin' out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra

Just another day in the life, G
Gotta step lightly 'cause cops tried to snipe me
The cabs, they don't wanna stop for a brother, man
But damn near have an accident to pick up another man
I went to the bank to cash my check
I get more respect from the motherfuckin' dope man

They pimp us like hoes, take our dough, but they hate us, though
You better keep your mind on the real shit
And fuck tryin' to get with these crooked-ass hypocrites
The way they see it, we was meant to be kept down
Just can't understand why we gettin' respect, now
Mama told me there'd be days like this
But I'm pissed 'cause it stays like this
And now they're trying to ship me off to Kuwait?
Give me a break, how much shit can a nigga take?
I ain't going nowhere, no how
Bush wanna throw down?
You better bring the gun, pal
'Cause this is the day we make 'em pay
Fuck bailing hay, I better spray with an AK
And even if they shoot me down
There'll be another nigga bigger
From the motherfuckin' underground
So step but you better step quick
'Cause the clock's going tick and I'm sick of the bullshit
You're watching the makings of a psychopath
But you sit and laugh before the wrath and aftermath

Pullin' dimes out to climb out for time-out

Reloaded like Carlito, incognito

Thinkin' I'm givin' 'em the bo-bo-vee until they O.D"

I come to grips that a lot of mic users is dikes
I come to grips with the likes of Fred Hampton
Cold, so I'm lampin, with no need for spotlight
When I got light like an intersection, you talk
But you came to my town with protection
Election year, had the block hot
I scream ""fuck the world"" but having a baby girl sorta cock-blocked
I write rhymes like I come from the Windy City
With my crew, I click like simply, stand midi with reality
Casually, I walk through these war games
Some claim saved but then they take on whore names
If that's the way your sex drives, stay in your lane
If you're a man, I can't tell like if the door rang now"

Blunt in his mouth with his hand on his gun
Bitches flappin' they gums, do he be clappin' and shootin' guys?
Actor or a movie star, rapper revolutionized?
What is his race, nation, or creed?
Is he Arabic, Black, Latin, Asian? They read
Magazines say I walked on water, talked to the heavens
Spit at judges, stepped on peasants
But in reality, I just entered your galaxy
September '73, up in these wild streets
Fuckin' these wild freaks, a harem of hoes (Goddamn)
And my mystique got 'em tearin' my clothes"

I'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got
Way bigger fish to fry
Which is why I'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off
The handle and wait for the fist to fly to put this guy in a pine box
He's always lookin' for chaos but tonight I've cooked up a plan
So this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons
I'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'
He walks by, kicks my arm and goes, ""Oops"" and just laughs
I yelled for Mom (Mom) and as she's rushin' to my defense
I stood up and said, ""Fuck you, punk"" and I took off and ran
To my bedroom, as I fled
Knowin' shit would hit the fan
Slammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat
He kicked it in
I swung it hard as I could at his head
His noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed
I'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear
I threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass
Beat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain't so bad
""Ding-dong,"" the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his
Stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two-liter with
Then buried him next to my dog
And if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em"

I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advised, and apparently, I'm over-influenced
By what you are doin', I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me"

Niggas threatening my life like it's hard to find me
See me shining in the hood like twenty inch Lexanis
My mom said I'm hard head, I don't follow the rules
Why should I when Reebok giving niggas they own shoes?
And I'm dealing with the same problems 50 Cent got
Yayo in jail and they think I'm trying to take his spot
I'm in the studio laughing at Chris Rock
Then I turn on MTV and see Soulja Slim shot
And niggas trying to gun me down in the rim shop
'Cause I just want the same recognition that the Crips got
They say I'm the next in line and if I get shot

So I gave her some Hennessy, she gave me some head
I fucked her on the floor, so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then Lil' ½ Dead put his dick on her head
Take that bitch home and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone

A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her

I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-r
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite, money-wise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Choco blunts'll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up a trife life, the times of white lines, the high pipes
Murderous night times and knife fights and blight crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, cold strapped
With my peeps that's into drug money market interact
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rollin' match, from craps to cee-lo
With side bets, so roll a deuce, nothin' below

Scarface	11	Win Lose or Draw	My Homies	1998	[Verse 1]	"I read the book of Revelations
And now I realize we in revelations
And on that note, I make this statement
For all the young guns to become one to die young
Because the world is filled with hatred
And they aim to blame our sons
And I've done seen down the barrel of a strap before
But I don't wanna die no mo', I fear the reaper
Help us, Jesus, help to keep us away from all the sadness
And deliver us from the hate that 'cause the madness
I'm glad it's installed in me from day one
Believe in something because most of my homies believe in nothing
And paying for it, God bless your souls, I'll be praying for it
Eventually, you'll have your day in court
And I done been a witness to homicide
Seen a whole family die
Before the stones of diamonds in the sky
Through my bloodshot eyes feel the hurt and all the hate
That I've trapped inside because the hurtin' hard to ache
There's a smile on my face
But, that's to keep a man from crying
'Cause deep down inside, I know I'm dying
I'm born for it, gon' take some time to gettin' used to
And Satan I know that your listening but I rebuke you
And refuse to let you capture me and kill my will
Just to survive the game of life, win or lose
Do or die, refuse to let you capture me to kill my will
To survive the game of life, win or lose, do or die"

D's in undercover cars takin' my picture like I'm a fuckin' star
I'm up to par, my game is in a smash with half a million in the stash
Passport with the gats, first name and last
Ask anybody if my men are rowdy
Give me the mini-shottie, I'll body a nigga for a penny probably
I'm obligated to anything if it's crime-related
If it shine, I'll take it; still in my prime and I finally made it
I hate the fact that I'm the last edition, properly a stats magician
Could've went to college and been a mathematician
Bad decisions kept me out the game, now I'm strictly out for cream
Doin' things to fiends I doubt you'll ever dream
My team's the meanest thing you ever seen
Measured by the Heaven's kings, down to the Devil's mezzanine
I've never screamed so loud, I'm proud to be alive
Most heads die by 25 or catch a quick three-to-five
So be advised: the street's full of surprises
It's not what crew's the livest, wanna survive, it's who's the wisest"

Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee, I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back, fuck gettin' hit
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it

Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb

Make me wanna call 50 and let him know what's on my mind

Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly

Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy, I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me

Click your Timbs three times, the wizard is Nas
Grant you a wish, you get rich while listening hard
To my thugs in the prison yard, bench-pressing 200 pounds and up
Feeling like you down on your luck
Raise up, I feel your pain, hit the law library
Appeal the game, all eyes on me
Restrained from, being looked at, it's uncivilized
We epitomize thug song, y'all niggas get mad
Jealous rappers is puss, ain't got no style
No heart and no look, shook
Get stole on, my niggas move right in the moonlight
Y'all niggas get done, I pee on them son, they a small issue
We too official, blue steel pistols
Teflon vests, it's no contest, we hit you"
2Pac	18	The Streetz R Deathrow	Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...	1993	[Verse 1]	"Growing up as an inner city brotha
Where every other had a pops and a motha
I was the product of a heated lover
Nobody knew how deep it screwed me
And since my pops never knew me
My family didn't know what to do with me
Was I somebody they despised?
Curious look in they eyes
As if they wonder if I'm dead or alive
And poor momma can't control me
""Quit tryin' to save my soul, I wanna roll with my homies!""
A tickin' timebomb, can't nobody fade me
Packin' a 380 and fiendin' for Mercedes
Suckers scatter but it don't matter I'm a cool shot
Punks drop from all the buckshots the fools got
I'm tired of being a nice guy
I've been poor all my life, but don't know quite why
So they label me a lunatic
Could care less, death or success
Is what I quest 'cause I'm fearless
Now the streets are deathrow"

The birds keep hawkin', why?
'Cause I'm heard in every CD  and Walkman from D.C. to Boston

Around my way, niggas don't got remorse for out-of-towners
Come through frontin' and get stuffed with the 3-pounder
The loud sounder, ear ringer
And I'mma point the finger at all you wannabe gunslingers
You got a real ice grill, but are you really real?
Step to the hill and I'mma test your gun skills
'Cause real niggas don't try to profile
You just a chump who needs to get drunk to buckwild
But swing that bullshit this way
And I'mma make your visit to the 'Bridge a motherfuckin' short stay
Queensbridge — that's where I'm from
The place where stars are born and phony rappers get done
Six blocks and you might not make it through
What you gonna do when my whole crew is blazin' at you?
With MAC's and TEC's to lend to get your dome crushed
You thought that you could come around my way and beef, stupid fuck?
What the hell you smokin'? What the fuck possessed you?

Throw on my Timbs, black mask and black serpent
Twist a nigga cap then jump in the J-30 'cause I'm..."

Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are
Talk bad about her nigga, guaranteed to snap like bra
Straps, sticking together like grandma and grandpa-pa
In this dog-eat-dog world
Kitty cats be scratching on my furry coat to curl
Up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to hurl, 'cause most of the girls
That we was liking in high school, now they dyking

Kurupt	4	A Doggz Day Afternoon	Dogg Food	1995	[Verse 1]	"In the dead of winter, is when I kick my coldest phrases
Mental as telepathy, lyrically it amazes
Construction of thoughts that's lethal as turpentine
An expert when I flex rhymes feared like ex-cons
In my zone you can't even find like Atlantis
Stalk like a prayin' mantis, leavin' battered bodies on the canvas
The burial ground for clowns
Open casket, trackin' niggas down like fuckin' basset hounds
Tragic how the mic gets handled
Prodigious like a vandal on a midnight scandal
You scramble like Randall, abusive when I recite
On the stage, double access with a brand new muthafuckin' mic!"

But it's happening again, huh?
Y'all used to be in my corner
Now you just backed me in one
Innocent bystanders, I'm bound to hit some
For some adversaries, I carry big guns
So some targets'll get the kill shot
Some, I just barely nicked 'em
I can make a mistake and erupt and end up takin' a dump
For sayin' some dumb shit, thinkin' I run shit
Misplacin' my anger enough to give Earl and Tyler, The Creator the brunt (Yeah)
Shoulda never made a response, shoulda just aimed for the fake ones
Them traitorous punks, 'cause snakes are just cunts
They can get fucked with eight hundred motherfuckin' vibrators at once (Yeah)
And for any of those who may have come close to about dyin'
And can't listen to ""Arose"" without cryin'
For those who feel low like you're 'bout spiralin'
But this is only for those that I'm inspirin'
Weapon never unholstered without firin'
My will I'm imposin', foes are gonna feel like they're in the throes of a mountain lion
They talk about my daughters hopin' I fly off of the handle (Handle)
'Cause my first thought is to trample and write a thousand bars
But sometimes it's like dropping' an anvil on a house of cards
Or Godzilla squashin' a crouton with combat boots on
Or droppin' a goddamn nuke bomb on top of an anthill

No love for them other crews and rival kids
All them outta-town niggas know what time it is
And if they don't, they need to buy a watch, word up!
Caught up in the crossfire, get theyself hurt up
While I be sippin' gin straight in a plastic cup
On a park bench on 12th Street, my whole crew's famous
You tried to bust your gat and keep it real, but you nameless
First of all, slow down, you on the wrong route
Let me put you on your feet and show you what's it all about
The street life ain't nothin' to play with
No jokes, no games, kid
For years, I been doin' the same shit

Cause if a bitch tries to diss me while I'm full of liquor
I smack the bitch up and shoot the nigga that's with her

Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate

Havin' a lack of funds and resortin' back to guns
Tired of bein' stared at
Tired of wearin' the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of steppin' in clubs, wearin' the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people sayin' they're tired of hearin' me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me
Sayin' they wasn't feelin' me on ""Nobody's As Ill As Me""
And I'm tired of radio stations tellin' fibs
Tired of JLB sayin', ""Where hip-hop lives"" (Where hip-hop lives)"
Eminem	15	The Kids	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Chorus]	"See, children, drugs are bad (That's right)
And if you don't believe me, ask your dad (That's right)
And if you don't believe him, ask your mom (You can)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (She will)
So kids, say no to drugs (Smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does (That's right)
And there's really nothin' else to say (Right on)
Drugs are just bad, mmkay?"
2Pac	18	Papa’z Song	Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...	1993	[Verse 4]	"I never meant to leave, but I was wanted
Crossed too many people, every house I'd touch was haunted
Had to watch the strangers, every brother was a danger
If I wanted to to keep you breathin', had to be out of range-a
Had to move on, done lost my name and picked a number
Made me watch my back, I had no happy home to run to
Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin' fast
But livin' slow mean half the dough and you won't get no ass
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped, got caught and sent to jail by the courts
Now, I'm doin' time and I wish you'd understand
All I ever wanted was for you to be a man
And grow to be the titan you was meant to be
Keep the war fightin' by the writings that you sent to me
I'm so sorry..."
Common	22	In My Own World (Check the Method)	Resurrection	1994	[Verse 2]	"I say pay attention boy, I say uk look at here
I want you to see me; when you do, you look in fear
I dilate pupils that's cornea than a retina
My Book of Life you felt it, because of the texture
When I'm bubbly I call the ex ta, see if she still love me
I'm advanced like a copy studs be on my sac to dub me
Cheap ass niggas, go and purchase it
I ain't do all this work for shit
My style's my child I gave birth to it
Like an immaculate conception, clean I came
Went through label pains, didn't give shorty a name
I put, bros before hoes that's the way love and life goes
It's a Jungle out there but I'm never Fever-in for them white hoes
I love black thighs, you sisters better realize
The real hair and real eyes get real guys
So before you makeup your face, you better make up your mind
I hope you wake up in time for the revolution, or you gon' be like
""I can't believe it! I got shot!""
Bowe, so I lick one, not for Riddick
But I got the Rid, for my dick
And the crab MC's that be all over it
Huh, what good is the Rid without the comb?
I'm the street pick peace to Nick, Tim, Mark and Kendall
I remember me and Dion tried to get into Mendel
I didn't have No I.D., they wouldn't let me in
Now them same gumps be askin' me to get them in
I be like, ""You don't know me... fool""
And color him purple (why?), 'cause he ain't in my circle
Now I'm talkin' square biz to you and I'm out
I'm in my own world"
Kanye West	5	Never Let Me Down	The College Dropout	2004	[Verse 2]	"I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood, I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's or to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey, I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you seen the car I bought her
And you sent tears from Heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah, now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side"
André 3000	27	She Lives in My Lap	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Chorus]	"She lives in my lap, she lives in my lap
She lives in my lap, she lives in my lap
She lives in my lap, she lives in my lap
Oh, she lives in my lap (Forever my fiancée)
She lives in my lap (Don't leave, don't stay)
She lives in my lap (I'll get the courage one day)"
2Pac	18	Young Niggaz	Me Against The World	1995	[Verse 1]	"As a young nigga, I'm almost runnin' in the wind
Give anything, to be that innocent again, when I was ten
I didn't bang, but I was hangin' with the homies
'Til them niggas started slangin', now they don't know me
I got my hustle on, learned to ignore what couldn't pay me
Lately, I've been tryin' to make a million, can you blame me?
With that jealousy, they need to miss me, don't sweat me
If them cowards really want me, come get me, and even I
Someday will die, but I'm cautious, I'm fin' to ride
Put down the top, now we flossin'
Hit the freeway, let the wind blow, drop the window
Workin' with a twenty sack of indo, feelin' good
Stop through the hood, grab the young thugs
And I can't help but reminisce back when we slung drugs, though it's bad
But all we had was our hopes and dreams
Couldn't see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends
As young niggas"
Scarface	11	Mind Playin’ Tricks ’94	The Diary	1994	[Verse 3]	"Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't seem to keep my mind on a steady track
I'm all about gettin' mine so I study that
But it seems they want to get me
So I try to keep my 9mm with me
Just in case they want to see a homies head blown
But I got to stay around to see my kids grown
I finally found a woman who could deal with me
Back then I had a woman who wasn't real with me
And now she's back with her old lady
And now I got it goin' on and they sure hate me
Now I'm a goner and she's a loner
Ha ha ha, yeah, her mind was playin' tricks on her"
Eminem	15	My Darling	Relapse	2009	[Verse 1]	"If I were to rap about the crap that's out
That's the route you probably want me to take
‘Cause you're just dyin' to know what I think
And my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin' about Paul Wall
You'd probably crap in your pants, ‘cause I'm white and he's white
So he's like my competition, I mean, right?
Nope! Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba
So bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-but, I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep, it's awesome
I'm like a sleepin' giant, and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
And sink my teeth in 'em, and fill 'em
Full of poison, and make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em
And let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em
And smack 'em with the backward E, the Eminem emblem
I was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face him
Tell him why, look him dead in the eye, then waste him
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
Then swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
For this rap game and it g-g-goes
One-two-three, chk-chk, one-two-three
Chk-chk, one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny
So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers: ""Come nearer"""
Eminem	15	Kill You	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Verse 3]	"Know why I say these things?
'Cause ladies' screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
These eighty Gs a week to say the same things tweece
Twice, whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots, I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em 'cause their ratings stink
Fuck that
I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all seventy thousand pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before-school or outta school
I don't even believe in breathin'
I'm leavin' air in your lungs just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play, I got the machete from O. J.​
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep eggin' me on 'til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop?
Shut up, give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you
You hear me? Answer me"
Dr. Dre	1	Approach to Danger	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Verse 2]	"Fatal approach to danger, just to remain a strangler
Out run, the shot of a gun when the game's up
Murder in the first degree, but it's worse to be
A dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody
With everybody thinkin of death
I kept workin, to be one of the last niggas left
So many people lookin for hope, they broke
Without checkin the fingerprints on a motherfucker's throat
A heart of steel can reveal the real nigga in me
So figure to see, the D-E-A-D
Bodies like a nigga straight walkin in a cemetary
So it's very necessary to carry
Ammunition for niggas wishin but they better take caution
Before Dre goes off
And starts killin motherfuckers just in order to change the
Anger for the real nigga when I approach to danger"
Future	30	Blow a Bag	DS2	2015	[Chorus]	"I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi
I blow a bag today, I walk in the mall and go crazy
I blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em, babe
I blow a bag today, hop out the whip on 'em, babe
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, Chyna gon' fuck me so crazy
I blow a bag today, I blow a bag today
I blow a bag today, I don't do nothin' fugazi"
Nas	9	You Won’t See Me Tonight	I Am...	1999	[Verse 3]	"Thinking of me, you getting the chills
Like a rush through your body when you think how it feels
Give me a call and my voice give you butterflies in your tummy
Tell your friends you in love with Nas, not his money
And I'll prove I'm a man of my word - handed you furs
Iceberg, everything on this planet Earth a woman desires
You make a good wife to most men
I know I got you open
But -- you just my close friend
Get it baby"

The Game	13	Where I’m From	The Documentary	2005	[Verse 2]	"Y'all niggas got it fucked up
What you thought 'cause I'm from Compton I couldn't do numbers like Usher?
Platinum certified, nigga that's a mill' plus
Play both sides of the fence 'cause the Crips feel cuz
See me ridin with Nate, nigga it's still Blood
You can C-walk to this, homey it's still love
Nigga I've been bangin' since Mary J did Real Love
(If you don't know) I painted the Rover black
The west coast is back, I can smoke to that
Moms got the CL-6, that's a fact
I bought the house, I'm just waitin' on the platinum plaques
Niggas lookin' for a cat to jack
Homey I'm willin' to do two life sentences back to back
So please don't push me
You niggas is W-N-B-A, all pussy"

You pay me and I'll pay you
Hold on boo, you got the game all wrong
This ain't yo' thang, this my song
Move on, we in the club at the Shark Bar
Valeted my keys and park my car
No snap shots cause I might get popped
As I slide by security, givin 'em props (whattup, whattup)
First thing I do, when I get in
Let me take you back to when I first slid in
Grab my gi-din, get my pid-in
Put my bid in, no bullshittin (no bullshittin)

With smoke comin' from up under us like we sittin in the sauna
Burnin up the charts (burnin up the charts)
Break a bitch heart, lil' mama don't you start"

Then there was one set of footprints in the sand

When times get hard and shit hits the fan
God don't walk with me, he carry me man"
Jay-Z	12	What More Can I Say	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 1]	"There's never been a nigga this good for this long
This hood or this pop, this hot or this strong
With so many different flows, this one's for this song
The next one I switch up, this one will get bit up
These fucks, too lazy to make up shit, they crazy
They don't, paint pictures, they just, trace me
You know what? Soon they forget where they plucked
Their whole style from then try to reverse the outcome
I'm like, ""TAA!""
I'm not a biter, I'm a writer for myself and others
I say a B.I.G. verse, I'm only biggin' up my brother
Biggin' up my borough, I'm big enough to do it
I'm that thorough, plus I know my own flow is foolish
So them rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
I'm in, new sneakers, dual-seaters, few divas
What more can I tell you? Let me spell it for you:
W-I, double-L, I-E
Nobody truer than H-O-V
And I'm back for more, New York's ambassador
Prime Minister, back to finish my business up"

Common	22	Sum Shit I Wrote	Resurrection	1994	[Verse 2]	"When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear a wack-ass rhyme
And I catch Alz-rhymers, then forget it
I get charged like a nigga in position with a stolen card of credit
Fuck flipping the script, the rap scene I'm trying to edit
My mellows call me ""Never"", they be like ""Never's going to get it""
Never's too much, I'm much too, I do justice to poetics
That's why cats be like ""Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!""
Other studs come through to see what I am up to
They be on the dick of crew giving us weed and buying us brew
Like Kareem I got the hook up, brothers look out cause they look up
Rest in peace to Harold, I'm washing tons of rappers like Booker
T. told me ""You gotta get out of the crib, get into the world""
How you going to come off with the style that's sterile?
It's like that, keep on, ha ha
It's like that, keep on"

Make sure I'm strapped, keep the uz' and the magnum
Yeah the gun too, but I'm talkin' 'bout the condom
They followin' me home with my dog right behind 'em
Have you ever seen a ass clap on a stallion
Of a bad bitch, half black and Italian?
I don't know if she likes me or my medallion
Think I give a fuck?
I'm just tryna get a nut
I don't need no one to build my self-esteem up
I'm fresh out the hood
Fuck it it's all good
Ma you can use me, 'cause I'ma use you
For a menage-a-trois, you know the usual
And if you do me maybe I'll do you
A favor and walk you outside, right"
Nas	9	Play On Playa	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Verse 2]	"Ruby red grapefruit juice with Grey Goose
Rubies in the Jesus piece, pimped out like Snoopy
But a East Coast thing, my girl's stocking
Tied up in a knot top of my bean head
Billion dollar dream head, went from triple beams to digitals
Servin' fiends to minimal, sixty G's
No criminal, no mo', just mo' dough
Mimosas pouring, Oprah's earrings
On fingers while your girl performs cunnilingus
'Cause there's big money, aroma lingers
Barber cleans his blade, then he give me a fade
Hot towel on the face, hot models who vomit
After they eat so they can stay lightweight
Swallowin' my protein like an Ovaltine shake
Come through like Mo Green from Godfather, so clean
Where I step, I 'Clorox' it, keep twenty G's
On both sides of the thighs, that's four pockets
Eighty thou to browse for the nicest price
But we ain't into buyin' conflict ice
That's the shit they stole from the Congo, and other black soil
True mack fo' you, nappy hair just spinning
Honey gave me a massage with a happy ending
Finest females, I just came on and sprayed her
Got to get your papes on, play on, playa"

The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
I'm known to gas a hottie and blast a shotty
Got more cash than Gotti (You don't know?), you better ask somebody
Big L is a crazy brother, and I'm a lady lover
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
I push a slick Benz, I'm known to hit skins
And get ends and commit sins with sick friends
'Cause I'm a money getter, also a honey hitter
You think you nice as me? Haha, you's a funny nigga
I flows, so one of my shows wouldn't be clever to miss
I'm leavin' competitors pissed, to tell you the truth, it gets no better than this
I'm catchin' wreck to the break of dawn

Amateurs drink veteran piss
From a Dixie cup, if you ever mix me up
Or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri
We'll rub it in, every club you're in, we'll have you blackballed
And make sure you never rap a-fuckin'-gain
Dre ain't havin' it, long as I'm here to play devil's advocate
If I could only use this power for good, I wouldn't, not even if I could
And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off
‘Cause I know if they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch, I'm punk rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck, white Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mil'
Or grow up to be Attila, go nuts and be a killer

Kanye West	5	Diamonds from Sierra Leone	Late Registration	2005	[Verse 2]	"I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say ""Kayne""
Got family in the D, kinfolk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then, my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, ""Pssh, we messed up.""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like ""Amen""
But r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands"

OutKast	28	Life Is Like a Musical	Idlewild	2006	[Verse 1]	"N-n-n-not too far but long ago
When life was straight up and cars would move slow
When you were cool if you were pigeon-toed
But things have changed (it ain't so simple)
Now life is a musical
I called Big Boi on the telephone
I said ""hey hold up 'fore we put out another song""
Say no matter what goes down we stand strong
Cause ain't nothin changed (it's simple)
Hey let's make a musical
Based on fict and faction
Or verse, vica throw in some action
And you got us well to a fraction
Cause things have changed (it's all hood)

When the cars ride by with the ""Boomin' System""
Two door Mustang, and the roof was missin'
Every girl at your school had the new extensions
Even gangstas was dancin' like New Edition
Cause the house parties stayed rockin all night
Niggas came through and shot it up but it was alright (alright)

Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
As she bust down like a twelve-bunk on tour
She suddenly realize she'll never escape the allure
Of a Black man, white man needing satisfaction
At first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinner's redemption, that sounds foolish
And you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten, he moved in and that's when he touched her
This motherfucker is the fuckin' reason why Keisha rushing to that
Block away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat
Then caught a knife inside the bladder, left for dead, raped in the street
Keisha's song, mmm
My little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face
The day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play"

When niggas in Compton first started to jack
When the bitches wouldn't give you no pussy
If you wasn't sellin' drugs
So many bitches in my neighborhood got mugged
They always loved that shit, they want a nigga that's sellin' keys
But nowadays, they workin' at Mickey D's
But in the days of wayback, I couldn't be laid back
Because I needed ends and I made that
I get the nine from my nigga that he lend me and
Start robbin' muthafuckas just like Cowboys and Indians
Anythin' it took to get paid
A nigga like Ren already had the plan made
And I was in it to win it and not to lose
And shit'd start blowin' up once I lit the fuse
And police couldn't touch me because I was payin' 'em
But not with no money, yo, I was sprayin' 'em
And never get caught because nobody is snitch
But one hoe did, so Ren had to shoot the bitch!
Now she's in a coffin and my life is better off and
'Cause everybody knows who's the boss and
That black nigga that they call Ren
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10!

He said, ""K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome""
He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
""I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed

I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours

Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother

Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone

Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own

Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

Nas	9	I Gave You Power	It Was Written	1996	[Verse 3]	"Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me, it's bullets, two vests and then a 9
There's a grenade in a box, and that TEC that kept crying
'Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty, it's clear
He's 'bout to fall to pieces 'cause of his murder career
Yo, I can hear somebody coming in
Open the shelf, his eyes bubbling
He said it was on, I felt his palm troubled him
Shaking, somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting
My creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally go off, making niggas memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat
Cocked me back, said, ""Remember me?""
He pulled the trigger, but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggas is waiting in Hell for him
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood
Sick of them thugs, sick of wrath of the next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor, his wig split
So fast, I didn't know he was hit, it's over wit'!
Heard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me
Damn!"
Common	22	Stolen Moments Pt. II	One Day It’ll All Make Sense	1997	[Verse]	"Extra salty 'cause whoever beat me, got me for this 31-inch
And this Alpha Bailey jacket I had just bought me
Out of snapping, my guy tried to talk me
But what could get me half way calm was this Donny Hathaway song
The tape that it was on I had wanted while I was gone
But forgot to pack it, in fact it was in that jacket
This demo, it's time to track it and lay it down
Either it's somebody I know or somebody I stay around
Day before I broke out, niggas was over my crib getting smoked out
No telling who had the place scoped out
Dot had brought over some niggas I didn't know
I'm asking who are you, they said I'm here with them all
If it was them, soon I'm a collide with them
And they better not be rocking no new Iversons
Then it could have been this hype that usually shovel my snow
If I'm out of town or not, by my car he would know
Now it might have been this stripper I met at Pinkhouse party
Thick, but my furniture wasn't worth her body
What if it was this nigga I let sleep in my crib?
They had a set of keys, but that I wasn't trying to believe
But I couldn't put it past him or those other bastards
It'd be assed backwards for me to ask if they did it
'Cause whoever did ain't gon' admit it
The blunt and dirty disses is my only exhibit
Wondering if I should give it a rest and through the wind it might surface
Cause telling the law, Joe, is worthless"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Wesley’s Theory	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 2]	"What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché? Then say, ""Fuck your haters""
I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a Gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five (Yeah)"
Eminem	15	Forgot About Dre	2001	1999	[Outro]	"Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say

Big Pun	24	Still Not a Player	Capital Punishment	1998	[Verse 1]	"Ayo, I'm still not a player, but you still a hater
Elevator to the top, hah, see you later
I'm gone, penthouse suite, Penthouse freaks
In-house beach, French comtesse, 10 thou' piece
Rent-out lease with an option to buy
Coppin' a 5 or Benz for when I'm not far up in the sky
Puffin' the lye from my Twinzito
Up in the Benzito with my kiko from Queens nicknamed Perico
We go back like PAs and wearin' PJs
Now we reached the peakage, runnin' trains for three days
Who wanna ride? It won't cost you a dollar
Whether soft or harder, of course you still gonna holla
Mama, I'm thick, huh? I'll rip my prick through your hooters
I'm sick, you couldn't measure my dick with six rulers
Hold up, chula, I'm all about gettin' loot
But I'll knock that boot if you out to get koofed"
The Game	13	Camera Phone	LAX	2008	[Verse 4]	"She call me Jay, I call her B
We gettin married, to the streets

With the B on my Bentley
The horse on my Lambo
Crown on my Cadillac
Checks on my Air Max
Haters, better fall back
Before I put sumthin' in your ball cap
That's my chick, I got her back like a bra strap
'Cause she fine and she cute
She think she all that, and she all that
That's my girl, that's my world"

If you've been there, you know what I'm talkin' about
Gettin' over tops my agenda
The easy way out, is to jump out of a window
But that's a dopefiend move gone left
I'll kill you, but not myself
I tried to do the right things major
But that didn't put no food on the table
Went back to school to get my GED
But who's gonna hire a motherfucker like me?
McDonald's don't fit
They work you like a dog plus they talk too much shit
Without them dollar signs
It's like livin' and dyin' at the same time
And you wonder why a motherfucker sell dope?
He ain't with being broke"
Snoop Dogg	0	LA	The Documentary 2	2015	[Verse 2]	"I'm from that big blue raggin', tip toe taggin'
Mustard and mayonnaise, with Daynas on the wagon
Brown paper baggin', baby mama naggin'
You're either skinny jeans, Gucci belt or straight saggin'
Pleasure and agony, black James Cagney
The wood is the wood, but the hood is like a cavity
So much tragedy, rarely see clarity
I'm like a heir-to-be, charity, sincerely
Los Angeles, scandalous, handle us how?
We the ones you get your swag from, write that down
Home of the green leaf, watch out now
High school lesson, y'all can drop out now
California highway, California my way
I do it that way, then roll a fat J
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my Cadillac car"
Big Boi	26	Church	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse 1]	"Big, slide into the mode, time to drop a load
My life is going downhill like some cardboard in the snow
My bank account is frozen, I
Don't think that I can get out this hole
Feel like the figure four leglock
Like the jury went away and then they came back deadlocked
I can't move, I can't eat, I can't even breathe
Can't even buy a decent sack without the stems and the seeds
No trees, no Ps to ease the stress of everyday living
But homeless people gotta suck it up wherever they living
The unforgiven or the unwilling, live a life of sinning
And expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginning, but"

A nice peace-fund ideas from people who look like we

Like, ""Damn, that man's face is just like my face""
So Pop, I forgive you for all the shit that I lived through
It wasn't all your fault, homie, you got caught
Into the same game I fought (Ugh), that Uncle Ray lost (Ugh)

Who the fuck am I? A young killer on the rise

Feelin' trapped in his inner self (It's fuckin' with my mental health)
Born in the city where the niggas die young
Mist-covered street corners collapsed where I slung
And everybody standin' stiff waitin' on the cake
I'm waitin' on a motherfuckin' break, ain't no escape
Make no mistakes and leave a motherfucker breathin'
They all got to die this evening, 'cause I believe in
You kill a motherfucker 'fore a nigga come through
With his crew makin' your nightmares come true
Now who gon' be the first to die

Put a hole through your front and your back, maybe
But go 'head, you try me
I'll have your ass hooked up to an IV
I leave no witnesses when I ride, B
You fuck with me, you'll see
I react like a animal and tear you apart
If a masterpiece was murder I'd major in art
Niggas know I was wrapped too tight from the start
But being a little off landed me on top of the charts (Woo!)
So you take the good with the bad, I guess
Level three Teflon plate on my chest
Hammer cocked back, hollow tip in the chamber, danger

Like, ""Homie, you don't know me
But the whole world owe me, strip!""
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fuckin' life
So now I'm down for whatever, ain't nothin' nice
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
But now this higher learning got the Remy in me
Liquor's invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off – Momma, forgive me
I can't be held accountable, D'evils beatin' me down, boo
Got me runnin' with guys, makin' G's, tellin' lies that sound true
Come test me, I never cower

Stop screamin', you know the demon said it's best to die
And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify

I was sixteen at the Palisades
Fumblin' my grades, I traveled with the team
The apache life, Centennial was like
When Mrs. Baker screamed at Doughboy
Mixed that with Purple Rain
They interchanged the scenes
Happy just to be out the hood
With all the wealthy kids
Credit cards and family plans
She drove her daddy's Benz
I found out that he was a sheriff
That was a win-win
Because he had locked up Uncle Perry
She paid her daddy's sins
Next time I fucked a white bitch
Was out in Copenhagen
​good kid, m.A.A.d city tour
I flourished on them stages
Whitney asked did I have a problem
I said, ""I might be racist""
Ancestors watchin' me fuck was like retaliation"

Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, 'cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness

I was getting my ass beat twice a week (What?)
Looking for a place for the night where I could sleep (Yeah)
Flippin' sofa cushions over just tryin' to see
If I could find some change and scrape up for a bite to eat
If Denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece
Twenty five cents each'd get us a bag of chips
We'd be glad to get that even if we had to split
We'd do backward flips, looking back at it
I think that would fit with the definition of not having shit
Couple that with the fact my mother was batshit
Pop was a sack of shit, yeah, he died, but I gave half a shit
Yeah, which brings me back to the dear ol' dad that I zero had
Since a year-old, forty-seven year-old scab
Just to hear them words, ear piercing
Like my earlobe stabbed with a needle for an earring
Should I feel upset? You were dead to me 'fore you died
Me? Tear no shed
Should I have made a mural at your funeral?
Had your coffin draped with a hero's flag?
Where the fuck you were at
When De'Angelo done hurt me real bad at the Rio Grande?
Never met your grandkids, fucking coward
Only guts you had was from your stomach fat
I couldn't see your ass goin' to Heaven
So I'm asking for a pass to go to Hell
So I can whip your fucking ass
I hate that I'll never get to say ""I hate you"" to your face
No coming back from where I'm going

Dig with the blade of it then I step on the metal
Vendetta to settle, tell the Devil"

And I pack the deuce-deuce of some ackrite juice
I'm in my own space and time
The elevation of my rhymes elevates your mind
It's a clear blue sky, and a clear blue day
For a G from D.P.G to wear clear blue and gray
I come, I came, I am, I ain't
The nigga ya wants to fuck wit', get peeled like paint
Bottoms up! Nigga, give it all ya got

Since I was born and raised on the streets
I quit the job I had and copped myself a sack
Went from a double of fifty into a C-note stack
Within a week, but my peak wadn't reached
I was gettin' too known on the north side of Long Beach
Niggas got to trippin' and I thought I heard a
So I went to the hood on 20th and Myrtle
I came up quick wit' some homies that I knew from way, way back
And then my sack, or maybe was seven, or was it eight hundred strong?
In other words — Daz had it goin' on!
I bought myself a bucket — that's right, a bucket, bitch!
Who you fuckin' — my car or my dick?
My lifestyle switched a bit, but my attitude didn't
I told all my old bitches ""Good riddance!""
'Cause when you got money, hoes come automatically
And old hoes don't do nothin' but cause some static, see?
I went from khakis to Guess, braids to a fade
I'm not Special Ed, but I had it made
Livin' the life of a baller care-free
Had bitches dyin' to sleep wit' me, ya see?
But I went bankrupt from all the spendin' and gamblin'
Bidness was gettin' slow, and I wadn't handlin'
Mine the way I was supposed to
Now I'm broke and on a jakk mission, so don't get close to

I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen

Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us
We supposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?
Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry (that's right)
The same game that make you math could make you die

Who would've thought you'd get popped one time and rat?

I dream my chain became a loose noose that was used to hang us
So now, my insane brain, my 32 teeth
And two feet creep like its Elm Street

Snoop Dogg	0	Bitches Ain’t Shit	The Chronic	1992	[Verse 4]	"I once had a bitch named Mandy May
Used to be all in them guts like every day
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucker, lickin' the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figured niggas wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one-time
I'm back to the motherfuckin' county jail
Six months on my chest, now it's time to bail
Uh, I gets released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homie Dr. Dre
Scoop in a coupe, ""Snoop, we got news
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues""
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfuckin' chin-checkin'
Move up the blocks as we groove up the block
See my girl's house, ""Dre, pass the Glock""
Kick in the door, I look on the floor
It's my lil' cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my ho, yo
(Bitches ain't shit) I un-cock my shit
I'm heartbroke but I'm still loc'ed, man, fuck a bitch"
Eminem	15	Old Time’s Sake	Relapse	2009	[Verse 2]	"Speak of the Devil, it's attack of the Rain Man
Chainsaw in hand, bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun, vrrunn, they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon? No one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon, a great one
Wait, it ain't funny, man, it's urgent, I need one
Two boxes of detergent in a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1"
Gang Starr	21	Blowin’ Up the Spot	Hard to Earn	1994	[Verse 1]	"Ah, so now ya got me pissed off, blast off, lift off
Time for me to twist off a vocal fist off
Into your dome piece, home piece
I heard your chick wants to bone me
I get wild like rugby, respected like Bugsy
Don't even ask me 'cause I'm livin' lovely
Born to succeed, foes bleed, true indeed
The oral combat will romp that, you're one of my seeds
When I first busted on the scene
Nigga, you knew I had more than a gangster lean
I mean, my lean is gangster, though, so check it
I'll stick an MC for his spot and sign in blood on his wack record
Boo-ya-ka, to your face as I ruin ya
Clown ya, dumbfound ya, while I'm screwin' the
Fuck out your girl as she steps into my world
I'm not the tallest, but that ass, I'll polish
And if the hooker runs her mouth, she gets cut off
But then you'll sweat her, 'cause like my leather, you're butter soft
Your style stinks, kid, you're garbage
And if you keep talkin shit, I'ma make you pay homage
'Cause the G to the U to the R-U came too far to
Let you slide through, rhymes will scar you
And who the fuck are you anyway?
I catch more wreck in a minute than if you rhyme for ten days
Throw the cash in the pot
You better dash, nigga, 'cause I'm blowin up the spot"
Kurupt	4	Housewife	2001	1999	[Chorus]	"Now this, this is one of them occasions
Where the homies not doin' it right
I mean he found him a ho that he like
But you can't make a ho a housewife
And when it all boils down you gonna find in the end
A bitch is a bitch, but a Dogg is a man's best friend
So what? You found you a ho that you like
But you can't make a ho a housewife (Wife)"
Big Boi	26	Ain’t No Thang	Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik	1994	[Verse 2]	"Well, nigga, you softer than silicone used to pump up tits (Yeah)
It's that nigga down in the Dungeon with them player-istic hits (Yeah)
I'm quick to stop a sucker flow like menopause at fifty
Original ghetto bastard, so now I makes a switch
I used to sell dope, but in 1994, I'm makin' Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
But, see, these voices in my skull has got me reminiscin'
About the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens
She had me makin' better grades to make a better life
But I never had no love or respect 'cause we's gon' be alright
I ran the streets and broke my curfew 'cause I gave a shit
I carried guns and butcher knives 'cause I was steadily in the mix
Yeah, it was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now
I'm at the end of my street, so it's time to take my stand now
I call the wild because it's time to take the streets
So if you ain't got the vertebrae or big enough nuts, retreat
I'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal
Just an international player, comin' through your stereo"
Kurupt	4	Respect	Dogg Food	1995	[Verse 3]	"Now, wit' Dat Nigga Daz, everywhere I roll I'm set to blast
The way to success is elevatin' too fast
Every corner that I turn, there's money to burn
Wit' no concern, count the amount, there's mo' to be earned
Set-trip — the word I hear every nigga spittin'
Sixty percent's trippin', forty percent's bullshittin'
Industry's shady, my safety's in jeopardy
Controllin' minds like mental telepathy
Niggas shady as fuck, Kurupt can see it in ya eyes
Anticipatin' for the real to come from the disguise
Tha Pound — we roll thick like one-time
And I could fuck yo' bitch after I bust just one rhyme!
All we do is smoke weed and get blitzed
And kick that muthafuckin' gangsta shit
Kick that muthafuckin' gangsta shit"
Nate Dogg	3	Don’t Tell	No Limit Top Dogg	1999	[Verse 4]	"It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none
Ain't no big deal until that ho squeal
Now I got to keep my fuckin' woman from around that ho
Take a fuckin' rubber everywhere that I go
Keep her from her family 'cause her cousin know
She say she fuckin' Nate but she can't prove it though
Next time you can't come if you got a loud tongue
I know I got a big dick, shouldn't loaned it to a trick
This time you act like a nigga who just did a crime
You got yo ass busted now you facing time
The money's in the pack, it's on the drivers side
The nigga you was with is hoping you be quiet
Now you facin twenty all by yourself
The nigga you was with, man, he rich as hell
Even though this story is a fairytale
Act like you that nigga, bitch, and please don't tell"
Scarface	11	Game Over	The Untouchable	1997	[Verse 4]	"Dear diary, I'm runnin' outta pages
Fadin', in and out, takin' purple hazes
The dazes, Revelations in the last stages
Red skies institute, the silent horns playin'
I'm prayin' with tears in my eyes

But they eyein' my bank account with beams on my rover
The killa failed to launch his attack"

She eight centimeters, my lil' man 'bout to fall
Scuffin my Air Forces, runnin through the hospital hall
Deja vu, like I been here before
I'm feelin reborn, like a Bed-Stuy bredren
My first born, Dre I'm bout to have a Bad Boy
Family in the lobby, see my nigga Church, whatup
Shit, I left the camcorder in the truck
Runnin through the maternity ward, out of breath, sweatin
I swear to God every minute's startin to feel like a second
I see hell starin down the barrel of a Smith and Wesson
My son's ultrasound the closest I ever been to heaven
Lord forgive me for my sins, I know it's last minute
Put the chronic in the air, a lil' hash in it
Spread my wings, if only I could fly
Why fight to live homie if we livin to die?"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	Follow the Leader	Follow the Leader	1988	[Verse 2]	"This is a lifetime mission, vision a prison
Aight, listen
In this journey, you're the journal, I'm the journalist
Am I eternal or an eternalist?
I'm about to flow long as I can possibly go
Keep you moving 'cause the crowd said so
Dance, cuts rip your pants
Eric B. on the blades bleeding to death, call the ambulance
Pull out my weapon and start to squeeze
A magnum as a microphone, murdering emcees
Let's quote, a rhyme from a record I wrote
(Follow the leader) Yeah, dope
'Cause every time I stop, it seems you're stuck
Soon as you try to step off, you self-destruct
I came to overcome before I'm gone
By showing and proving and letting knowledge be born
Then after that, I'll live forever, you disagree?
You say never? Then follow me
From century to century, you'll remember me
In history, not a mystery or a memory (Rakim)
God by nature, mind raised in Asia
Since you was tricked, I have to raise ya
From the cradle to the grave
But remember, you're not a slave
'Cause we was put here to be much more than that
But we couldn't see because our mind was trapped
But I'm here to break away the chains, take away the pains
Remake the brains, rebuild my name (Rakim)
I guess nobody told you a little knowledge is dangerous
It can't be mixed, diluted, it can't be changed or switched
Here's a lesson if you're guessing and borrowing
Hurry, hurry, step right up and keep following the leader"
Future	30	Moment of Clarity	Pluto x Baby Pluto	2020	[Chorus]	"Moment of clarity, I'm straight off the yacht
Upping my currency, I'm taking your spot
Fuck a celebrity, treat like a thot
Ain't no comparing, the game in a knot
I keep additional guns in the door
High-tech surveillance came with a remote
She got Balenciaga on the road
I need some codeine, it's curing my soul
Watches and watches and watches and chains, yeah
A whole lot to changе, yeah
Shottas on shottas on shottas with K's, yeah

And I still remain the artiste through thees all
If you force my hand, I'll be forced to draw (Hahaha)
If the war calls for Warhols
Hope you got enough space on your hall's walls
I make niggas murals, then escape the Bureau's investigation
Out in Europe on vacation
I'm back for these puppies with the pound, boy (Rrrrra!)
Here's a round, boy (Rrrra! Rrrra!), down, boy
Sound boy, you don't wanna sound-clash; loud noise
Leave niggas paranoid if not paralyzed
Which means you can't walk in my shoes
Too much green; you can't talk in my hue
Extend the team, nigga, holla at Lu'
1st and 15th, that's my cue
I'm through"

Peace to all the DJs who gave me love on they mixtapes
And once again, the man's back with a dance track
So here's your chance, Jack, to get loose and let your hands clap
I got juice like Boku, mad crews I broke through
Brothers be mad 'cause I hit more chicks than they spoke to
And every time I'm jammed, I always find a loophole
I got a crime record longer than Manute Bol
And my raps are unbelievable like aliens and flyin' saucers
No more iron horses 'cause I'm buyin' Porsches
Comin' straight out the NYC

They claim that I'm violent, but still I keep
Representin', never give up on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
'Cause I'll remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise to all my boys
Know the real from the busters and the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fist if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
Learn to survive in the nine-tre'
I make rhyme pay, others make crime pay
Whatever it takes to live and stand
'Cause nobody else'll give a damn
So we live like caged beasts
Waitin' for the day to let the rage free
Still me 'til they kill me
I love it when they fear me"

""I want you to be a father, he's your little boy (Uh)
And you don't even bother, like
‘Brother' without the ‘R’, and he's startin' to harbor
Cool on food for thought, but for you, he's a starver
Startin' to use red markers on his work
His teacher said they know he's much smarter, but he's hurt
Used to hand his homework in first
Like he was the classroom starter,"" burst to tears
Let him know she's serious
""Now he's fightin' in class
Got a note last week that says he might not pass
Ask me if his daddy was sick of us
'Cause you ain't never pick him up
You see what his problem is?
He don't know where his poppa is
No positive male role model
To play football and build railroad models
It's makin' a hole; you've been diggin' it
'Cause you ain't been kickin' it since he was old enough to hold bottles
He wasn't supposed to get introduced to that (To that)
He don't deserve to get used to that
Now I ain't askin' you for money or to come back to me
Some days it ain't sunny, but it ain't so hard
Just breaks my heart when I try to provide
And he say, 'Mommy, that ain't your job'
To be a man, I try to make him understand
That I'm his number-one fan, but it's like
You booin' from the stands, you know the world is out to get him
So why don't you give him a chance?"" It's like"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	Relax With Pep	Don’t Sweat the Technique	1992	[Verse 3]	"Check one, then I'ma check another one too
The R's brand-new so you can view a few
I got an exquisite exhibit, explicit
Is it a whizz-kid or Kid Wizard? Well, is it?
Relax, I'll track, out lap the half stepper
Here come the right one baby, I'm Dr. Pepper
So check the Richter scale,  rhymes overload
Blow up and explode abrupt and reload the code
You can't pinpoint or locate the rate
Or evaluate the up-to-date
Stayed upfront, laid back, coming off on track
Girls want some of this because I'm all that
Sweat the concept as the ep's in depth
As the track is kept, you can't intercept the step
Reacts and projects and attracts and it gets
To the max and in-depth, it attacks but it's relaxed with pep"
Gang Starr	21	Natural	The Ownerz	2002	[Verse 1]	"It's that wise older brother
That mind-moldin brother
Still that nine-holdin brother, spittin like no other
I smother other rappers as they gasp for air
Came to give you exactly what you asked for here
I'm like a one man task force here
And once again, brains on bend as I go half with Premier
Here, I give you the mic, sike
This is my stage kid, you'll feel my rage kid tonight
Who's gangsta, who's flossin, who's thuggin, who's boss man
I'm here to get respect from L.A. from Boston
My celly rings often cuz I got the goods
MC's ride the wood, any beef I got the hoods
Now come come now, what the heck were you thinkin
Feel the dum dum's now, leavin you numb while you leakin
I'm speakin, just to let you rap pro's know
Ain't no gimmicks, no phony image, cuz I'm a natural"
MC Ren	17	Something Like That	Straight Outta Compton	1988	[Verse 2]	"Well for the record it's Ren, and for the street it's villain
And strapped with a gat, it's more like Matt Dillon
On ""Gunsmoke"", but not a man of the law
I'm just the baddest motherfucker that you ever saw
See, I peep and then I creep on a fool
Get my blood pressure high, but still stay cool
Dig a grave of a nigga lookin' up to me
That really had the nerve that he could fuck with me
Who was the man in the mask, while I was waitin' to ask
You know, it's MC Ren kickin' mucho ass
Gettin' respect in showbiz
Hey yo homeboy, 
Why don't you tell 'em what your name is?"

All the killers remain silent (Remain silent)
Niggas strapped with 45's and ain't smiling (Ain't smiling)
And I'm driving to a place they all roamin'
The lake we build houses, but it's the hood we call home
In the ghetto, the only place a motherfucker will keep it real
We focused on the dollar bill, still
The outsiders tend to disrespect the place
Where niggas do they struggle and died with a straight face
Surviving under conditions demons died in
You could run it, but can't hide it, so step aside
It's the nigga that makes music for the streets
'Cause I love this motherfucker like pussy with no sheets, 'cause it's deep
Some niggas make it out the neighborhood and won't surface
They let the money make 'em nervous, what's the purpose?
A motherfucker sitting on fat
Who done came up out the hood, but he can't come back
Fuck that, I remain in the street game frame
On a mission to maintain me then take aim
In a position to let my opposition know my life
'Cause off in these streets, I keep it real but what's right?
Surviving, sitting on a ki doing business on a beeper
I'm sinking in this motherfucker deeper
Fear the Reaper, that no man born of woman harm me
Fuck beat these niggas in your army, though I'm a killer
Enter the ghetto, so that you can see
What I mean when I say I love this 'cause it loves me
Let it be, stop looking at this motherfucker strange
And talking 'bout a motherfucking change
This is for the thug niggas"
2Pac	18	Me Against the World	Me Against The World	1994	[Verse 1]	"Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket
The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried
I'm losin' my homies in a hurry, they're relocatin' to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses
'Cause this is how it is, what's the use?
Unless we're shootin', no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world, baby"
Snoop Dogg	0	(O.J.) Wake Up	Tha Doggfather	1996	[Verse 3]	"Uh, gonna work that motherfucker and do the percolator
Cause Snoop Dogg came back with the head raider
Al Davis's? Nah nigga Tracy Davis
The Eastside Long Beach greatest
Criminal with style and boy you love that
Sit back, relax and let me drop another rap
But this one's for the sisters and not the hoes
The ones who be groovin' it on the step shows
Let a nigga in, I ain't diss ya friend
And like The Staples I make sure we do it again
But don't blow a nigga up or show a nigga up
And don't think a nigga sprung cos you know a nigga fuck
Love is a house and you got the key
So give it to a nigga like a D-O-double G
I'm from the"

Feels like you got a hold on me

Infatuated with your physical, damn, I like your style"
MC Ren	17	She Swallowed It	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Verse 1]	"Slow is the tempo
Now talkin' but a nympho, so peep it out, here goes the info
This is a bitch that did the whole crew
She did it so much we make bets on who the ho would love to go through
And for the shit that she does, give her a drumroll
Because the dumb bitch licks out the asshole
And she'll let you videotape her
And if you got a gang of niggas, the bitch'll let you rape her
She likes suckin' on dicks and lickin' up nut
And'll even take the broomstick up the butt
Just to say that she did it with a rapper
But the pussy was more fishy than red snapper
""But how many licks would it take,"" she'd ask
""To make MC Ren start gushin' up vanilla shake?""
She took her tongue out her mouth, put it on top
Like a cherry, started movin' it like a snake and it was very irresistible
I couldn't pay the bitch to quit
'Cause the ho was doin' some ol' crazy shit
That made me start havin' a fit
'Cause the bitch sucked a hellafied dick (Suck this dick)"

2Pac	18	Rebel of the Underground	2Pacalypse Now	1991	[Verse 1]	"They just can't stand the reign, or the occasional pain
From a man like me, who goes against the grain
Sometimes I do it in vain
So with a little bass and treble
Hey mister, it's time for me to explain that I'm the rebel
Cold as the devil
Straight from the underground, the rebel, a lower level
They came to see the maniac psychopath
The critics heard of me, and the aftermath
I don't give a damn and it shows
And when I do a stage show, I wear street clothes
So they all know me
The lyrical lunatic, the maniac MC
I give a shout out to your homies
And maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, G
On the streets or on TV
It just don't pay to be, a truth tellin' MC
They won't be happy 'til I'm banned
The most dangerous weapon: an educated black man
So point blank in your face
Pump up the bass, and join the human race
I throw peace to The Bay
'Cause from The Jungle to Oaktown, they backin' me up all the way
You know you gotta love the sound
It's from the rebel - the rebel of the underground"

Skatin' through your town, puttin' it down, y'all relatin'
No waitin', I'll make your block infrared hot: I'm like Satan
Y'all feel a nigga's struggle, y'all think a nigga love to
Hustle behind the wheel, tryin' to escape my trouble
Kids stop they greetin' me, I'm talking sweet to keys
Cursin' the very God that brought this grief to be
My life is based on sacrifices, jewels like Isis
And fools that think I slip, you fuck around
You get your guys hit, they built me to be filthy
On some I-do-or-die shit, for real
The price of leather's got me, deeper than ever and
Just think, winter's here, I'm tryin' to feel mink, nig-ga"

Let me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)
I'll show you where the Bloods at, where the Crips at
Show you where they flip crack, where they pitch at

Let me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)"

Havoc	7	More Trife Life	Hell On Earth	1996	[Verse]	"A rainy day laid up thinkin', sittin', gettin' bent
Watchin' old '70s flicks
Mind's on the slouch back in the couch, heard the phone ring
It was a shorty from Uptown I met back day
Long time no hear from, no doubt, long time no see
I heard you had a seed, a baby girl and now she's three
What's up with that cat, you know who, your baby pops
Slung rocks up top, then heard he got knocked
""He home, fuck that nigga, I'm on my own
Matter fact, got my own crib, plus I'm all alone""
Word? The bitch is bad, chill, son, she got me tempted
Reminiscing the fatty, jumped in the ride I rented
Fresh Timbs, Mecca dice well presented
Sippin E&J straight, was bent when I entered
Gave her a hug, stared her straight into her mug
See, ain't seen the bitch since back then and that was bug
Turned the VCR on, Friday, my favorite flick
Offered me a drink, Alizé, I take a sip (No doubt)
Got into convo, ""How you been over the years?""
""Neglected, stressed out, and living in fear""
""What you mean? I thought you left that cat,"" which was true
""I'm not talkin' about him, another dude
Been with him for a year and had a baby by him
Matter fact, you saw him downstairs, you walked by him""
Now I'm thinking setup, could it be? Or maybe not
She said, ""Don't sweat it, he don't got the top lock""
Tried to play it cool, but in my head, shorty's wildin'
Usin' me to get the next nigga jealous, called up the fellas
Ty Nitty line was busy, so I beeped Gotti
Gotti was with Trip and two other grimeys
The Twins, ""Let me begin, then explain
I'm at this bitch crib and I think she got me framed
Stuck without a gat, not prepared for combat""
Gave the address, told my son there's more cats
Be there in a second, big gats, no half steppin'
They flippin' on me, talkin' 'bout I never learn my lesson
I laugh in additional, hit them with the math
Hung up the jack while shorty soaked in the bath
Played the living room, dozed off for a second
When I woke up, shorty was standing ass-naked
Make moves, all this bullshit, pussy better be good
Stepped to the room, threw off my Champion hood
Slow motion, all along, bent off the potion
Shorty went down and had a nigga wide open
It was over, laid up in the cut, I heard a thump
Jumped up, threw on my boxers, yo, what the fuck?
All the sudden, I saw this Black motherfucker
With this big-ass gat and two other motherfuckers (What the fuck?)
Black masks, clutching duct tape, no escape
Tied me up, smacked me all in my face
Shorty wasn't even screamin', looked up, saw 'em schemin'
""Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got this nigga now, we got this""
All bloodied up, shook the fuck up, held for ransom
They yelled, ""Got the bones,"" smiled, then started dancin' (Yeah)
The phone rung, it was my sons, they let 'em know they had me hostage
Threw me on the phone, said, ""Son, don't worry, yo, we got this""
Regardless what the outcome all this bullshit
Take a nigga word, don't ever go see a bitch, word"
Snoop Dogg	0	(Tear ’Em Off) Me & My Doggz	Tha Doggfather	1996	[Chorus]	"(Sick 'em)

JAY-Z	6	Adnis	4:44	2017	[Verse 2]	"Did you see the runt as the front-runner
Leader of the pack, you see that in your youngins
What ancestors did you summon to the summit
To give me what I needed, what you need to take from 'em
The tsunamis that I swum in to become in
Had the cable with the anchor for the places that I sunk in
Unc in a better place but you couldn't function
Shot junk in your arms, more than your veins was punctured
I punted on feelings, 'cause you said you was coming
You couldn't kick the habit, I wish you said something
You can't avenge these many sins with your own hands
You wanna make God laugh, just tell him your plans
Who would've thought I'd be the dad I never had
Be the husband I've become, usually nothing come from that
I forgive you as I live through the beautiful present of the past
I'm just thankful that I get all these gifts to unwrap"
Prodigy	8	Trife Life	The Infamous	1995	[Verse 1]	"It's just another day, drowning my troubles wit' a forty
That's when I got a call from this brown skin shorty
She asked me where's my crew at, said we could do whatever
She got a crew too and said that we should get together
I said, ""Aight, just call me back in a hour
So I can take a shower and gather up the manpower""
Then I hung up the horn
And I thought to myself that it might be on
'Cause this trick ain't pick up the phone to call me in years (Why?)
Ever since I left the ho lonely in tears
Ain't no telling what her friends putting up in her ears
Ideas of setting me up I'm not trying to hear
(Check it out, son) So we take the gats for precautions
Plus, this trick live in Brooklyn, home of the coffin
She might got a whole battalion of Bucktowners
Waiting for us to get up off the train and surround us
Or maybe, I'm blowing this shit out of proportion
But this shit do happen to niggas very often
So fuck it, a nigga gotta do what he meant to
My crew got my back, 'Fuck the world' is my mental
We put together five soldiers
The bitch called, my blood curdled
Told me to meet her on Myrtle
Got to the plaza, we're waiting for the G train
We put a plan together, just in case the beef came
Now we Bed-Stuy bound
Far from home and on unknown ground
But together we six deep, with five heats, nothing sweet
First nigga frontin' getting lifted off his fucking feet
It took eternity to reached our destination
My heartbeat is racing like a cardiac patient
We finally got to Myrtle, outside the train station
I saw not a soul, told my peoples to be patient
But hold up, that's when a black caravan rolled up
My legs then froze up, I grabbed my pound
Told my man, ""Eyes open 'cause it might go down""
Said he don't like the way the shit is starting to sound
Every angle of the car was smoked out and tinted
So we couldn't tell if the enemy was in it
It might have been TNT, I wasn't trying to wait and see
We jetted through Marcy 'cause D's ain't bagging me
Word, son, they got us on the run, dunn, see, yo"
Kanye West	5	Runaway	My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy	2010	[Chorus]	"Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes

Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can"

50 Cent	19	Best Friend	Get Rich Or Die Tryin’ Music From And Inspired By The Motion Picture	2005	[Verse 1]	"First we get to talkin', then we get to touchin'
If we get past the phone games, we'll be fuckin'
I kiss like the French do, I put my tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it, girl, and pull on your hair
For me, a different scenery just means a different position
In the tub or on the sink, I improvise, now listen
In the chopper or on the jet, join the mile-high club
I'm no fool, I know money can't buy me love
But I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
Instead of a rose, there's a hundred dozen of those
See I see somethin' special when I look in your eyes
With your legs way back, I see this pussy is mine
If you ain't sure when I'm talkin', I don't tell you no lies
But there's things that you say that have me wonderin' why
When I don't say what I'm thinkin', it don't mean that I'm shy
Got on that shit that you picked out for me, that's why I'm so fly"
Future & Metro Boomin	32	Ice Attack	WE DON’T TRUST YOU	2024	[Chorus]	"Metro Boomin, he a millionaire, fuck it, take it back
Metro Boomin havin' cheese now, these niggas nothin' but rats
I been drankin' codeine, steady rockin' these baguettes
I can feel this money, power, got these niggas so upset
I can't worry about the flawed shit, these flawless on my neck
Went banoodles on the dog ass ho, that's all
Go paradin' whenever, I just spazz out, uh
Dripped in Louis V bandana, I got my rag out, uh"
Kanye West	5	Diamonds from Sierra Leone	Late Registration	2005	[Verse 1]	"Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
""Does he write his own rhymes?"" Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
""Damn, is he really that caught up?""
I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name ""Porsche"" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is ""Minivan""
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because—"

Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies
Take off the weird-ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps, then I'm taking off top five
Take off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it's a real world outside (Take that shit off)
Take off your idols, take off the runway, I take off to Cairo (Take that shit off)
Take off to Saint-Tropez, five-day stay, take a quarter mil', hell if I know (Take that shit off)
Take off the front flag, take off perception, take off the cop with the eye patch (Take that shit off)
Take off the unloyal, take off the unsure, take off decisions I lack (Take it off)
Take off the fake deep, take off the fake woke, take off the, ""I'm broke, I care"" (Take it off)
Take off the gossip, take off the new logic that if I'm rich, I'm rare (Take it off)
Take off the Chanel, take off the Dolce, take off the Birkin bag (Take it off)
Take all that designer bullshit off, and what do you have?"

50 Cent	19	21 Questions	Get Rich or Die Tryin’	2003	[Verse 2]	"If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now, we could have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that (Like that)"
Guru	20	Suckas Need Bodyguards	Hard to Earn	1994	[Verse 1]	"MCs are laid out like stiffs in the morgue
Praise the Lord, you're in awe when I'm grippin' my mic cord
Rhymes I rip with swift execution
One verse could coerce your girl to prostitution
The Guru is now the brother that you're fearin'
Beware when I'm making hits with Premier and
Rolling to a spot near you, lyrics tear through
Chrome to your dome, you better watch your rearview
Niggas been held back too long, we're coming up
In the streets we roam alone, so watch me running up
I'm summing up a mad posse of warriors
Night crusaders able to break down barriers
And bringing faces of death, putting MCs to rest
Until there's no fake chumps left
Run, step, yeah, bounce, nigga, bounce
My rhyme's are cargo and yours is just a quarter ounce"

2Pac	18	Hold Ya Head	The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory	1996	[Verse 2]	"These felonies be like prophecies
Beggin' me to stop ‘cause these
Lawyers gettin' money every time they knock us
Snatchin' pockets lyrically, suckers flee when they notice
Switched my name to Makaveli, half the rap game ghost
Exposed foes with my hocus-pocus flows, they froze
Now suckers idolize my chosen blows
And mo' money mean litigatin', mo' playa hatin'
Got a cell at the pen' for me waitin'—is this my fate?
Miss me with that misdemeanor thinkin', me fall back?
Never that, too much Tequila drinkin', we all that
Make them understand me? Hell nah, this ain't my posse
Everyone with me is family, ‘cause everybody's got me
Watch me paint a perfect vision, this life we livin'
Got us all meetin' up in prison
Last week I got a letter from my road dog, written in blood
Sayin', ""Please show a playa love""—hold ya head! (Hold it!)"

Eric B. & Rakim	14	I Ain’t No Joke	Paid in Full	1987	[Verse 2]	"I got a question as serious as cancer
Who can keep the average dancer
Hyper as a heart attack? Nobody smiling
'Cause you're expressing the rhyme that I'm styling
This is what we all sit down to write
You can't make it, so you take it home, break it and bite
Use pieces and bits of all my hip-hop hits
Get the style down pat, then it's time to switch
Put my tape on pause and add some more to yours
Then you figure you're ready for the neighborhood tours
The E-M-C-E-E, don't even try to be
When you come up to speak, don't even lie to me
You like to exaggerate, dream and imaginate
Then change the rhyme around, that can aggravate me
So when you see me come up, freeze
Or you'll be one of those seven emcees
They think that I'm a new jack but only if they knew that
They who think wrong are they who can't do that
Style that I'm doing, they might ruin
Patterns of paragraphs based on you and
Your off-beat DJ, if anything he play sound familiar
I'll wait 'til E say, ""Play 'em""
So I'ma have to diss and broke
You could get a smack for this, I ain't no joke"
Eminem	15	Bad Meets Evil	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Verse 3]	"I used to be a loudmouth, remember me?
I'm the one who burned your house down
Well, I'm out now
And this time, I'm comin' back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon' leave you with a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me, like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe"

Nigga, what you know about time?"
Big Pun	24	The Dream Shatterer	Capital Punishment	1998	[Chorus]	"When you awaken, your manhood'll be taken

My mind starts tripping, a tear drops my eye
My body temperature falls
I'm shaking and they break in tryna save the Dogg
Pumping on my chest and I'm screaming
I stop breathing, damn, I see demons
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
I can't die, my boo boo's 'bout to have my baby
I think it's too late for praying, hold up
A voice spoke to me and it slowly started saying
Bring your lifestyle to me, I'll make it better
How long will I live? Eternal life and forever
And will I be the G that I was?
I'll make your life better than you can imagine or even dreamed of
So relax your soul, let me take control
Close your eyes, my son, my eyes are closed"

MC Ren	17	Prelude	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Verse 1]	"The real niggas is back, cause there's too many bullshit records out
Niggas fiendin for what we put out
But you don't have to wait no longer
Because the new album is out and the shit is much stronger
So many groups made three albums or more
And that weak-ass shit is still sittin in the record store
They wonder why it never sold
Niggas rappin since the 70's and still never went gold
Our first record sold two million copies
That's because you other motherfuckers are sloppy
You came out street and crossed over
And after that your career is fuckin over
Because of that you're not around
So shut the fuck up and witness the sound of some real niggas"
OutKast	28	Bowtie (Postlude)	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Interlude]	"Oh, baby, we really clean

Watch out now! Ow"

Gotta make a flight, big day, slummin' no FaceTime
50K, wonderin' why I'm stormin' off, no race
Emboldened by the bliss
I was sworn in by a kiss
Latе from the country caters
No peacеmaker, I sweep up cases
Goin' on a walk with a new suit armor
New suit dead, Bottega, that's on it
Give me the heat from the sleep, then I harm her
Cupid creep in, sleep with a hammer
Three time to get me T-T-T'd
Still same phone, AT&T-T
Still givin' news very vividly
Beefin' up, fuck a beef
Smokin' on some vicious type of reefer
I need no beef, no cheese (Yeah)
Even when I eat, they cheat (Uh)
Every time we meet, naive"

All this talk is bitch-made, that's on my Lord
I'll kill 'em all before I let 'em kill my joy
I done been through it all, what you endure?
It used to be fuck that nigga, but now it's plural
Fuck everybody, that's on my body
My blick first, then God got me
I watch 'em pandеr with them back-handed compliments

Guru	20	You Know My Steez	Moment of Truth	1997	[Verse 1]	"Who's the suspicious character
Strapped with the sounds profound?
Similar to rounds spit by Derringers
You're in the Terrordome, like my man Chuck D said
It's time to dethrone you clones and all you knuckleheads
‘Cause MC's have used up extended warranties
While real MC's and DJ's are a minority
But right about now, I use my authority
‘Cause I'm like the Wizard, and you look lost like Dorothy
The horror be when I return for my real people
Words that split wigs hittin' like some double Desert Eagles
Sportin' caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtractin' all the rappers who lack over Premier's tracks
Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
So as I have in the past, I whoop ass
Droppin' lyrics that be hotter than sex and candle wax
And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that
While the world's revolvin' on its axis
I come with mad lovin', plus the illest warlike tactics
The wilderness is filled with this
So many people searchin' for false bliss
I'm here with the skills you've missed
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
Sorta like the master builder when I make my way home
You know my steez"
Nas	9	Watch Dem Niggas	It Was Written	1996	[Chorus]	"Gotta watch dem niggas that's close to you

Smokin' sherm, drinkin' malt liquor — father, forgive 'em
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin'
Fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steering wheel, blush while she bail out bustin'
Fuck 'em all, watch 'em fall screamin'
Automatic gunfire exorcisin' all demons
My mafioso messiah, my congregation high, Ready to Die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggas unite
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place
I could hardly wait to bust freely
Got you red-hot, you so happy to see me
Make the front page, prime time, live on TV
Nigga, my girlfriend, baby 45 but she still live
One shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop"

Hey, teacher, teacher, tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise"
André 3000	27	Y’All Scared	Aquemini	1998	[Verse 3]	"Yo, paragraph indent, I make intense sense
Niggas on that Gil Scott dope—hint, hint
At age fifteen they start smokin' Billy Clint'
Now he's twenty-one and wants to know where the time went
Hey, hey, hey, what's the haps? Well see your time elapsed
Have you ever thought of the meaning of the word trap?
Baboon on your back, but what's sad is that crack
Was introduced to Hispanic communities and blacks
But then it spread to white and got everyone's undivided attention
'Cause your daughter is on it and you can't hide it
Maybe your son tried it
Rehab too crowded
You scared, she scared, they scared, I said
They scared they scared to talk about it
Bout it, bout it, bout it, bout it, bout it
If you scared, say you scared"
Guru	20	ALONGWAYTOGO	Hard to Earn	1994	[Verse 3]	"There's a large amount of wack crews
For them, I got bad news
Time to pay your dues, you fools
I'm like express mail, with the script that hits
Like the third rail, when I shock the spot, it's hot
From the rays of the sun
Original one the prophet sent to become
A law giver, 'cause you shiver when I quiz ya
All about the real necessities of life
All about the game and all about the name
G to the A to the N to the G Starr
We know who we are, but do you know who you are?
You go down there looking for justice, that's what you find, just us"

Limo to the limit, fill it 'til the brim get in it
You can't get it, if you gotta ask
(Make me pretty) In that case I want two masks
Bottom class, dollar cast, poppin' tags, droppin' trash
In shopping bags 'til Akeem take our pocket cash
(Am I beautiful?)
Write it in lights, molly in the body of Christ
Drop me to the lobby from heights (trust me)
Then over the threshold to redeem the doorway
Fourteen broads like the king of Norway
Fourteen broads having dreams of foreplay
Fourteen arm Shiva, viva la coup!

Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato? (You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?

All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod

Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got"

But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?

But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher, girl
Fucking with me, you can be all you can be"

2Pac	18	Old School	Me Against The World	1995	[Outro]	"Haha, on the real though
Remember seein' Brooklyn go crazy up in the motherfuckin' party?
Remember motherfuckers used to go, ""Is Brooklyn in the house?""
And motherfuckers would lose they goddamn mind!
That's the old school to me; that's what I'm sayin' (Super Rhyme)
I remember goin' places that motherfuckers was scared to say
They was from anywhere but Brooklyn; that shit was the bomb
Back in the motherfuckin' old school nigga
Remember skelly, nigga? Knockin' niggas out the box, poppin' boxes?(My Adidas)
Remember stickball? Member niggas to run that shit like that?
Remember the block-- 'Member screamin' up at your moms from the window?
(LL Cool J is hard as Hell...)
The ice cream truck, remember all the mother--
'Member the Italian Ices, yo? Yo, remember the Italian Ices?!
The Spanish Niggas comin' down with the coconut ices and shit?
I came through the door, said it before
That was the shit!"

No, my heart don't pump no Kool-Aid
Jump and you'll get too sprayed
Who raise your block? The one and only OutKast
Many a niggas fallin' fast and
I continue blastin'
Swiftly, they ain't gon' get me, got somethin' for 'em
The devil up in your grill and you still don't even know him
Show him who's the okay
Like collard greens and hoecakes, I got soul
That's somethin' that you ain't got
That's why your style is rotten, stop in the land of ATL
Where nothin' but pimps fully equipped quick to make a sale
Swell, swollen, got my pockets, business boomin' like rockets
Folks try to stop it, but they know that it's that"

Nas	9	If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)	It Was Written	1996	[Verse 2]	"The way to be: Paradise life, relaxing
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path
The Villa house is for the crew — how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better living, type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies, history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling
Tricking six-digits on kicks and still holding
Trips to Paris, I'd civilize every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities, and reverse fiends to Willies
It sound foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa!"
Kendrick Lamar	16	The Art of Peer Pressure	good kid, m.A.A.d city	2012	[Verse 2]	"It's 2:30 and the sun is beamin'
Air conditioner broke and I hear my stomach screamin'
Hungry for anything unhealthy
And if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I'll continue eatin'
We speedin' on the 405, passin' Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses
Good Lord, they knew we weren't from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there
We pullin' out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn't like
Then started interrogatin'
I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That's ironic, 'cause I've never been violent
Until I'm with the homies"

Nigga, you a (Lame)
You's the fag model for Karl Kani, Esco ads
Went from Nasty Nas to Esco's trash
Had a spark when you started, but now, you're just garbage
Fell from top ten to not mentioned at all
To your bodyguard's ""Oochie Wally"" verse better than yours (Oochie wally wally, oochie wally wally)
Matter of fact, you had the worst flow on the whole fuckin' song
But I know, the sun don't shine if son don't shine
That's why your (Lame), career's come to an end
It's only so long fake thugs can pretend
Nigga, you ain't live it, you witnessed it from your folks' pad (Yup)
You scribbled it in your notepad and created your life
I showed you your first TEC on tour with Large Professor (Me, that's who)
Then I heard your album 'bout your TEC on the dresser
So yeah, I sampled your voice, you was using it wrong (I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me)
You made it a hot line, I made it a hot song (Woo)
And you ain't get a coin, nigga, you was gettin' fucked then
I know who I paid, God, Serchlite Publishing
Use your (Brain)
You said you've been in this ten, I've been in it five, smarten up, Nas
Four albums in ten years, nigga? I could divide
That's one every, let's say two, two of them shits was doo
One was nah, the other was Illmatic
That's a one hot album every ten year average
And that's so (Lame)
Nigga, switch up your flow, your shit is garbage
What, you tryna kick knowledge? (Fuck outta here)
Y'all niggas gon' learn to respect the king

Because you-know-who (Who)
Did you-know-what (What?), with you-know-who (Yeah)
But just keep that between me and you for now"
Dr. Dre	1	All in a Day’s Work	Compton	2015	[Verse 3]	"My whole life all I ever thought about is grindin'
Even though my surroundings only showed me crime and violence
That was back when a rapper needed guns way more than a stylist
And that was back when I felt like rappers was true motherfuckin' riders
Or even back in the day when I was a fuckin' youngster, man
 (Man, fuck the police)
 (Motherfuckin' Hub City)
Y'all too wrapped up in the bullshit and bias
Now reality TV is talking 'bout pulpits and choirs
Some of these hoes give less than a fuck when they runnin' their life story by us
It's the worst when I'm in a hotel, like a Hilton, sick and tired
And some of these housewives way too fuckin' desperate, these bitches thinkin' fame first
I can't knock the hustle, shit, it's 
But that's that shit with potential to make the game worse
Shit, it's just somethin' about that Hollywood curse, they just thirsty"

I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
'Cause I don't give a fuck like my middle finger was stuck
And I was wavin' it at everybody, screamin', ""I suck"" (I suck)
I go on stage in front of a sell-out crowd
And yell out loud, ""All y'all get the hell out now""
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up, y'all, I'm sorry
(But Eminem, this is your record release party)
I'm bored out of my gourd, so I took a hammer
And nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick, sick bastard
Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket (I ain't got it all)
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage (Oh)
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit"

The Game	13	Step Up	The Documentary 2	2015	[Verse 1]	"I'm from the home of the malt liquor, talk slicker
Where guns spark quicker, on fraud niggas
Them niggas better walk with you, take the long way home
My finger itchin' and this barrel so loooong
Like Pinocchio's nose my list of foes grows
Casket closed, air tight like Mystikal's cornrows
Expose rap niggas, take hoes from rap niggas
Never said shit when they seen me, get your toe tag nigga
The Compton lyricist, you niggas can't get with this
Used to tap Dre on the shoulder like, ""Nigga come hear this shit""
He thinkin' he slick and shit, nigga sweeter than licorice
Los Angeles god, we mob like Infamous
Ain't from Queensbridge or Brooklyn but we done shook ones
Bullets, I done took some, crack, I done cook some
Don't you stand there and look dumb
Ain't no honor amongst thieves, especially when the hook come lives, I done took some"
Eminem	15	My Darling	Relapse	2009	[Chorus]	"My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling

Once in a while, when niggas be trying to test me, I gets frisky
Grab a pint of golden whiskey
Then they swing but, shit, they missed me, huh
I'm getting nice with them things because I do like that
You heard me on the radio and, yes, my man, I'm true to that
I run my lyrics the way y'all wanna hear 'em
And shoot my dice against the bricks the way I wanna flicks 'em
Nigga, so ring around the roses, diamonds around my neck from flexing
But I'm running niggas over like a ninety-four Lexus, test it
Ten millimeters, count 'em, nigga, fuck a nine
See, I added a millimeter for y'all niggas doing crimes
And drive-bys, kiss your ass bye-bye, sayonara, suckers
I flipped the script and turned the page, ain't scared of you motherfuckers
Be popping shots like them hoes be popping coochies
And I still be spreading bullets like them freaks be spreading cooties
So look here niggas, I'm hunting Red October
I said my shit and ran my lyrics and now my verse is over"

Cup full of Henny, niggas gone off that YG
Told 'em take a fade little nigga saying 
You got your ass knocked out, which one of you niggas is Game?
'Cause you fuckin' my cousin, she don't like it, I don't either
Take all that bass out your voice, homeboy this is Cedar
Nah, take this quarter piece and drop it off in the trees

You can take the rag, don't get a scratch on my coupe though
And watch the Palmers they ain't tryin' to hear no truce though"

The chain remains, the gang is intact (Uh-huh)
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack?
Haha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep, I sold kilos of coke (So?)
I'm guessin' I can sell CDs
I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man
Let me handle my business, damn
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy
YG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive he's a millionaire
And even if I die he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere, oh yeah
He don't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money: last three lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear, sayin' exactly
What I been sayin' practically my whole career
The diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time (Ha)"

Slang that ass like I used to slang rocks
Bend over trick let me get to that spot
Later on you can lick on my lollipop

You know you get a hella response from my dick
Don't put your fuckin clothes back on 'til you rich
The type of woman I want tonight, a straight bitch!"

Eric B. & Rakim	14	To the Listeners	Follow the Leader	1988	[Verse 2]	"I'm the lord for somethin' you can absorb
Try and control and be cautious, but the cuts and the chords
Make me deeper than down, I make the crowd crowd around
People are peepless 'cause the soloist found
Phrases, thoughts made by the R of course
One thing I do is keep 'em different and far from yours
You keep talkin', when will all the damage be done?
You say you're rulin', but when I'm in the place, you don't come
Maybe you're waitin' to see what I'm makin'
One more style gets taken, then I'ma be breakin'
Into patterns and pauses, piano is soft
But make it hard for you to start where I left off
You find yourself lost 'til the point is across
You hit reverse to rewind it, that's when you hit the pause
I set the scene, first, you hear mixin'
Then the microphone fiend's in effect, still listenin'?
Pay close attention, never before mentioned
Listen up, I got a brand-new invention
Made from a musician, its notes are played crisp
But listeners listen to what I wrote on a disc
Copywritten but still bitten, it almost sound like
Almost pumpin', but it ain't down like
A record's supposed to sound, watch it, it goes around
Records are broken, smashed into the ground
That ain't my melody, brothers keep runnin' up and tellin' me
Others are tryin' to flow smooth and steadily
Potholes are left in my path, then I crash and bruise
Whoever refuse and cruise right past 'em
'Cause I just left to do it for easy forever, death
'Til I get back, you better stay in step
At the speakers, you'll stare, if I was there, your description is
Letters full of poetical messages, this is for the listeners"
André 3000	27	Spread	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse 2]	"I've got an eye out for she that cries out passionately
We'll do things backwardly, forwardly, horizontally
I'm too young to be settlin' down
Quick to change my mind tomorrow
So, now can I borrow your timid torso
More so than your soul? Honest me, gotta be how I roll
Fuck the rhythm, tuck the rhythm under your bosom
You're the prism, Shirley Chisholm
Was the first, let's rehearse makin' a baby
Put in your order, I want a baby daughter
Dance on the tip of my tongue
Shake the clouds until there's no more wetness in them
Tell your homegirls that you will send them
A postcard from 3000, hard"
50 Cent	19	I’m Supposed To Die Tonight	The Massacre	2005	[Verse 1]	"This is nuttin' new, I been in this position before
Grandma crib, niggas outside of her door
Different day, same shit, old MAC, new clip
32 hollow-tips, gloves, no rubber grip
I'm a boss, but niggas never show no respect
I catch 'em slippin', I'll have 'em tongue-kissin' my TEC
Wan come, test me, pussy boy, don't try
Police response never fast enough to shots fired
Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin' with son
'Fore we find out where yo bitch get her hair and nails done
It's elementary
Life is but a dream, you know row, row your boat
Ya blood forms a stream
After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper you take a life or yo life get took bitch
Sometimes I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel"

Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this, right here, history in the makin', man"

Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk"

'Cause you know it's me, my poetry's deep
And I'm Stillmatic, the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like tryna smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped, just knowing any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money
You can't pay me enough for you to play me, it's cockamanie
You just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's cuckoo
I got screws loose, yeah, the whole kit and caboodle
I'm just brutal, it's no rumor, I'm numero uno
Assume it, there's no humor in it no more, you know
I'm rollin' with a swollen bowlin' ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
You better love me, bitch"

Kendrick Lamar	16	FEAR.	DAMN.	2017	[Verse 3]	"When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn"
Snoop Dogg	0	Gz Up, Hoes Down	Doggystyle	1993	[Outro]	"Hell yeah, you know what I'm saying?
This is stricly for the G's, you know I'm saying? Fuck that, bitch
Niggas always handcuffing that ho
When a nigga like me steps in the place
I don't want that ho, I don't love that ho
I'm caught up with my greens
Collard greens, Indo and the cash flow
You know what I'm saying? Peace, G's up, hoes down"
Common	22	Thisisme	Resurrection	1994	[Interlude]	"Yo, I wanna say peace to my moms, my grandmomma

André 3000	27	Crumblin’ Erb	Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik	1994	[Verse 1]	"Yes, sir, let me dig into your brain, folks falling like rain
Poverty got me selling things, guess I'm gon' explain
Jane is rolled up, no gangs be throwed up
But still, André got action, they sweat like Keith, all on my teeth
I take it upon myself to handle mine
Thinking that you gots ample time to do this
Have you shot? I thought you knew this
I'm crumbling, no time for fumbling
Selling my sacks, watching my back
Wetting 'em up like splish, leaving 'em in a splash
Of blood, the clock is ticking, niggas from my block is missing
I'm putting it down like it be hot before we all get shot
Got only so much time in this bastard
Bitter be claiming pro, but I be saying they procrastinating
Settling for less
Better be ready when they roll up in your nest and sink one in your chest
And you's gone, up out of here for good
Y'all be bobbin' back and forth to let me know you understood
Yeah, what's up?"
Big Pun	24	Caribbean Connection	Capital Punishment	1998	[Verse 1]	"Yo, wanna rumble with the Pun, huh?
*blows raspberry* Shit on the whole industry
Yo, who puff more Owls than Pun? Pile on more styles than Pun?
Who the only one with over a thousand guns?
Running up in niggas cribs like I paid the bill
Make you squeal the combination to the safe for wealth
I lace your grill with the firestarter
Hit your wife with the sawed off
In the shower, power-drive ya daughter
I'm all about the fundamentals like Pun and pencil
A piece of paper, a decent caper and someone to strafe you
My mental's compatible with the radicals
My odyssey type qualities allow me to poli' with animals
Niggas is cannibals and the ghetto's the jungle
Where you either bet all your bundles
Or struggle or live civil and humble
My niggas'll rumble with any man for a Benny Fran'
Try to imagine what they can fathom for twenty grand
Niggas'll slice you and dice you into a thousand pieces
We pound out weak shit into the ground Uptown
Up in the Boogie Down, just wilding in jean
Pile on the green, surrounded in green like flowers in Spring
But now I'm a King, so it's more than money
All the honies used to call me Punny
'Cause my fam was always hungry
But now we rolling lovely and you feel worse
Want my money, let your steel burst
'Cause I'd rather see you in Hell first"
Scarface	11	One	The Diary	1994	[Verse 3]	"Hung up the horn and the hoes arrived
Three tight young tenders, them hoes was live
Rolled herself a woola, told her ""Fade me, troop""
Cock bustin' at the seams of her Daisy Dukes
Ass fatter than a motherfuckin' quarter horse
Ready to take one of these bitches to the slaughterhouse
Got my shirt over my dick 'cause it's hardened to fuck
Hoes eyes gettin' red, now they wantin' to fuck
It's about time to put the game in attack
Tapped her, told her bring ""ol' what's her name"" in the back
Got 'em in my room, about to hop in the tub
My homie walked in, ""Show your potna some love""
Told my homie, ""Put it down, we finna act a fool""
The ho said, ""Cool, hop yo' ass in the pool
I wanna polish up your tool""
But it's just one thing before you do
Can you..."

Dr. Dre	1	Let Me Ride	The Chronic	1992	[Verse 2]	"Just another motherfuckin' day for Dre, so I'll begin like this
No medallions, dreadlocks or black fists
It's just that gangster glare with gangster raps
That gangster shit makes a gangs of snaps, uh
Word to the motherfuckin' streets
And word to these hyped-ass lyrics and dope beats
That I hit you with, that I get you with
As I groove in my four on D's, hittin' the switches
Bitches, relax, while I get my proper swerve on
Bumpin' like a motherfucker, ready to get my serve on
But before I hit the dope spot
Gotta get the chronic, the Rémy Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smellin' like Indonesia
Bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
On my dick 'cause my four on hit
Pancake, front and back, side to side, and all that shit
So when I crawl, I comes correct
Now if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check, nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide
As I dip and make a trip to the south side, yeah"

Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm a terrorist, eat my asparagus
Then I'm asking her thoughts of a young nigga
Fast money and freedom, a crash dummy for dollars
I know you dying to meet him, I'll probably die in a minute
Just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million, and a Comptown fitted"
Common	22	We Can Make It Better	Late Registration	2005	[Verse 4]	"I think of eighty-seven ways to make better days
Whether crime or rhyme, I heard the rebel pays

Lloyd Banks	34	P.I.M.P. Remix	Get Rich or Die Tryin’	2003	[Verse 4]	"You need to switch over and ride with a star, it'll get you far
I'm a P-I-M-P G-A-N-G-S-T-E-R, yeah, I'm young but I ain't dumb
Got some tricks, but I ain't one
I'm a guerrilla for scrilla, I'll trip you, you try to run
I let 'em do as they please, as long as they get my cheese
Even if they gotta freeze, or if it's a hundred degrees
I keep 'em on they knees, take a look under my sleeve
I ain't gotta give 'em much, they're happy with Mickey D's, pimp"

I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' ninety on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: You coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you, and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim, shut up, bitch! I'm tryna talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see? I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?!"

Uhh, quiet in the court for the courtship
Marriage of the dork and the gorgeous
Took her from the king of the corpses
He revolved, jumped the wall of the fort with the horses
This was foretold, Bojangles was tappin' in Morse code
At least to the mad man genius, tap top secrets and more gold
(All of you)
From the guts of the mother
Campbell should move her undercover
With a $3,000 son she just want a lover
And somebody else to come and try and drug her
Take her off the grill, she done
(they will never love you)
Pills celebrating, ""We won""
In the system of the women, never knew he had it in him
This condition when the world that they make him become
(None of you)
Cocaine and new high tech ways, smuggle whole things
(I've always loved you)
From the control range that make radio heads with gold brains
(All of you)
To park 84' Jags on gold chains
Developing nicks from a whole name
God is great, but it's snakes on my soul plane"

Cousin Kim took off of work

So many aunties we could have an Auntie Team

She craves a wiseguy to help her gain amplify
So when you say, ""Yo baby,"" she ain't gotta say hi to ya
Cause prior to this, he put rocks on her neck and wrist
Plus a fat joint on her finger
You best to have a batch of scratch and treats to bring her
And if you happen to luck up and get in
You'll find yourself another jealous trick-ass boyfriend

And there went my suit, my doe sack and clout
My fresh low-low, also went too
And there was no denyin that my night was through
The one All-Star, the freshest thing I sported
Jumped on my board, for home I skateboarded
Made it to my pad, no time at all
Went to my room, or better yet the far wall
Hid the shoe away, still feelin pleased
Then jumped in my cot to catch some Z's
Early the next mornin, when I awoke
I threw on me old slippers with me old housecoat
Slid into the front, my family stared at me
Sayin, ""Wasn't that you? Nah, it couldn't be""
They kept askin me if I did my chores
My butt was saved by a knock at the door
""Who is it?"", that's what my brothers barked
""The princess,"" this sweet voice remarked
She said she was lookin for a certain man
Who could bring her the shoe like the one in her hand
The family ran around with their heads in the air
Bringin her shoes from everywhere
She just shook her head, a nod of relief
And said, ""No, that's not the one that I'm lookin' for, Chief""
I ran in the room and got my shoe
And said, ""Is this the one you're referring to?""
Well she said, ""Yes, and you're so cute
But where's your doe-doe and slick silk suit?""
I put on the shoe, then there came a flash of light
And I was wearin shit, from just last night
Looked out the window, saw the six-fo'
Yelled to my family, ""I've GOT to go!""
We drove up the Avenue, the princess and I
And in back of me, I heard my family cry..."

Hell extortion, sell your soul, live your dreams
Don't pay the cost then, say hello to the guillotine
A killer fiends for blood, screams of thugs

Give me your fear, money, respect, beer, honeys and sex, we're here
I'll bend them checks for years, hungry and stressed
You fuckin' with Chris - fuck Pun - dead the wrath for later
Get your calculator, the head decapitator's back forever
Can't count how many heads I had to sever
Half the niggas I keep, I put em back together
That's the terror, cut open your girl
And make a truss out her flesh, like Buffalo Bill

Tell you ain't a player by your sweater doused with wack feather
The Crib got the gangsta playa shit patent like black leather
I rap better than you, you, or maybe him
But I am like a tree and every lyric is a timb

Nate Dogg	3	Ain’t No Fun (If the Homies Can’t Have None)	Doggystyle	1993	[Chorus]	"It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none

Dr. Dre	1	Loose Cannons	Compton	2015	[Verse 1]	"You know where the fuck I'm from
From that muthafuckin' legendary
From the city where them niggas load clips in fast
And get stabbed at homeroom should've skipped that class
Shit will never change on the West Side
Jack your shit, take your car for a test drive (Ah shit)
Gangbangin' out the window hollering let's ride
Gotta keep a tec by the bedside
These niggas don't know my life
All this pain and what I sacrificed
And all my niggas that lost their life
You never die, you never die
I'm in that motherfuckin' one for a minute now
All y'all lil' niggas need to simmer down
Shut the fuck up, I'm the one that's killing now
Take a look who on top of the pinnacle"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	Keep the Beat	Don’t Sweat the Technique	1992	[Chorus]	"Tempo's movin', and I'm hopin' it'll never fade away
The beat is groovin', words are soothin'
And please tell me that you're here to stay
In the mornin', and I'm hopin' the mornin' come again
Hold me close, and give me another dose, and
Keep the beat, don't ever let it end"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Sunshine	Lupe Fiasco’s Food & Liquor	2006	[Verse 2]	"Never met her before
But I think I like her, like a metaphor—it's hard to get
In the car we sit, from the intro
She rolled down the window, just in case I was a schizo
I compliment her on the common sense
I'm calm, a little more confident
Uh-huh, and then we lose consciousness
She says that I've been waiting for you
And I know you've been chasing me too
Since they kidnapped me from a castle, I've been thinking of you
I told a fire-breathing dragon he better not harm me
Or be sorry when he meets my one man army
And thou has come to rescue me
My knight in shining armor, yes, you be
Woken up by the horn of an SUV
I said, ""See? Too beautiful to let you sleep
You're my sunshine"""
Kendrick Lamar	16	Hol’ Up	Section.80	2011	[Verse 2]	"Back in this bitch, in the back of that bitch
With my back against the wall and your bitch on the edge of my dick, jump off
I call a bitch a bitch, a ho a ho, a woman a woman
I never did nothing but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that I'm easily peddlin'
With the speed of a lightning bolt
As a kid, I killed two adults, I'm too advanced
I lived my twenties at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told, I'm like eighty-seven
Wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
From a distance, don't know which one is a Christian, damn
Who can I trust in 2012? there's no one, not even myself
A Gemini screaming for help, somebody"
Travis Scott	33	Nightcrawler	Rodeo	2015	[Chorus]	"Yeah, order more bottles, order more models
Order more hours, shots on an island
Hotter than the summer, the winter couldn't chill me
Young, free, and wildin', order more kidneys"
Future	30	Dedicated	The Documentary 2	2015	[Chorus]	"Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours

Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours"
JAY-Z	6	The Story of O.J.	4:44	2017	[Interlude]	"You wanna know what's more important than throwin' away money at a strip club? Credit

Nas	9	Life Is What You Make It	I Am...	1999	[Verse 1]	"You a killer or a hustler, dealer or customer
Gangsta or buster, youngster or old nigga
A weed head, a coke sniffer
You rich or a broke nigga
Know you all relate to this shit that I wrote niggas
Lots of my mans trapped up in a max
Penitentiary, sending me letters I answer back
That eventually we be all Bentley'd out
Throwing campaigns, fuck it, I'm running for White House
My niggas control Senate, pipe seats, Jeeps tinted
Mad Lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit
Did dirt now I knew it would come back one day
So I'm on point, strapped, prepare for gunplay
Stared at one face, thought it was beef, he looked familiar
Ready to blast, nigga gave me daps said I feel ya
Can't believe how my life changed
From the hood, the first time in my life
I can say I did the right thing"
Lil Uzi Vert	31	Marni on Me	Pluto x Baby Pluto	2020	[Verse 2]	"Bitch, I drip in my sleep

Lupe Fiasco	23	Hello/Goodbye (Uncool)	Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool	2007	[Verse 1]	"All in together, the weather is better than ever
I hope it never ends, I hope it lasts forever
But when it does, we can all pretend that it's
Better than it's ever been
Lie to ourselves like the skies, we'll rebel
And it's well, and it's fine and it's fine if they fell
And you can refine the storyline if you survive to retell
We all targets, hello darkness"
Nas	9	Ghetto Prisoners	I Am...	1999	[Verse 2]	"Yo, we gotta be God's children, habitats in tall buildings
Rats crawl in filthy hallways, incinerators
Sinners who faithless, still there's hope, pray it's answered
Dreams turned real - what's a wicked nation?
One with blind men - not takin' charge of the situation
Empty arguments and real conversations needed
The world'll need it, to hear it
Evil tries to weaken my spirit - it's chronic herb
This hurt come from the honest word
I now try hardest to serve my maker, what I learned
Find it's way on the paper, so I could dictate it
Articulate it, luckily - I was put on one of the ships that made it
Through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded
To sink in the Atlantic
Satan jinxed the planet, not to get too religious, but
Who decides when and if your life is finished?
If Christ is in this, for the sake of your name, oh Lord
May we break away from the chains abroad"
Common	22	Faithful	Be	2005	[Verse 1]	"I was rollin' around, in my mind it occurred
What if God was a ""her""?
Would I treat Her the same? Would I still be runnin' game on Her?
In what type of ways would I want Her?
Would I want Her for Her mind or Her heavenly body?
Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit' Her, would I still be wantin' my ex?
The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex
Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck
Her, I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
Ride wit' Her, 'cause I know for me She'd die
Through good and bad, call on Her like I'm chirpin' Her
Couldn't be jealous 'cause other brothers worship Her
Walk this earth for Her, glory, I'm grateful
To be in Her presence I try to stay faithful"
Guru	20	Now You’re Mine	Hard to Earn	1994	[Verse 1]	"Yo, Duke, you're dead wrong, you'll never have the skills like mine
I write the ill type rhymes, now I'm reachin' my prime
360 dunk in your face
You can't compete, you're just a basket case
Let's separate the men from the boys
And put your money where your mouth is, no time for toys
Your game is weak, you geek, so don't sleep
'Cause I'll be checkin' ya, wreckin' ya when I start to creep
Through the backdoor, I know I caught you out here
You got no clout here, and I doubt there
Is any way that you can stop the beat down
You ought to play the background and sit back down
Chumps like you, I gotta keep 'em in line
So prepare to suffer, boy, 'cause now you're mine"

Havoc	7	Streets Raised Me	Murda Muzik	1999	[Verse 1]	"It's kinda bug how I dose sometimes; know they staring
Brain feels like a wheel lost without the ball bearing
Stuck, contemplating who I can trust
But like yayo in a bill my feelings just get crushed
That's why I stick with my duns, like I stick with the guns
Don't get mad, rip your hun, concentrate on my funds
Lift heavy gats concealed by my waist
Never get patted down when I step in the place
Jiggied up, scope the spot, confirm beef, if it's not
Bally up, after this get followed straight to the crib
Gem star, double edge apply pressure
Shave 'em down, blow marks intruding through your mecca
Wanna be a thug, now you got the thug look
Stick 'em up, leave Medicaid with the bill to foot
God-Body, with a rubber grip black shottie
Pump one in that ass make a nigga switch hobbies
A dosage, hand delivered, without postage
Bring it to your door step quick on short notice
Niggas get sniped like, clog your bronchite
Show 'em how to rock right, when bitches are holdin mics

The Game	13	Moment of Violence	The Documentary 2.5	2015	[Verse 4]	"And it's fucking murder

Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place, I do
But I can't and I won't, say I try, but I know that's a lie
'Cause I don't and why, I just don't know"
Dr. Dre	1	Fuck Wit Dre Day (And Everybody’s Celebratin’)	The Chronic	1993	[Interlude]	"You better raise up

2Pac	18	Violent	2Pacalypse Now	1991	[Verse 3]	"As I was beatin' on a cop, I heard a gun click (Uh-oh)
Then a gun shot, but I wasn't hit
I turned around, it was my homie with the gun in hand
He shot the cop (Damn), now he's a dead man
I said, come on, it's time for us to get away (Let's go, we gotta get the fuck outta here)
They called for backup and they'll be on their way
Jumped in the car and tried to get away quick
The car wouldn't start (Damn), we in deep shit
So we jumped out (Come, on, let's take the cop's car)
We drove a little ways thinkin' that we got far
But I looked up and all I saw was blue lights
If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gunfight
I grabbed the AK, my homie took the 12 gauge
Load 'em up quick, it's time for us to spray
We'll shoot 'em up with they own fuckin' weapons
And when we through sprayin' then we steppin'
This is a lesson to the rednecks and crooked cops
You fuck with real niggas, get ya fuckin' ass dropped
So here we go, the police against us
Dark as dusk, waitin' for the guns to bust (What's next, man?)
What's next, I don't know and I don't care
One thing for sure, tommorrow I won't be here
But if I go, I'm takin' all these punks with me (Pass me a clip)
Pass me a clip, G, now come and get me
You wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent

2Pac	18	Part Time Mutha	2Pacalypse Now	1991	[Verse 1]	"Meet Cindi
She's twenty-two, lives right on the dope track
Used to be fat now weighs less than a Tic Tac
Now what's that say about this big epidemic
This hypocritical world and the people in it
Now speakin' of, in it Cindi loved to get buckwild
Fuck with a smile single file she'll bust enough styles
That would be cool, if she was your lover
But fuck that, Cindi was my dope fiend mother
Welfare checks never stepped through the front door
'Cause moms would run to the dopeman once more
All those days, had me fiendin' for a hot meal
Now I'm a crook, got steel, I do not feel
So don't even trip, when I flip with my thirty-eight
Revenge is a bitch and my hit shake the murder rate
Word to the mother, I'm touched
When moms come by, niggas hush or get rushed
Maybe one day she'll recover
But what will it take to shake or break
My part time mutha?
I gotta live with a part time"
Havoc	7	Bounce	Infamy	2001	[Verse 1]	"You can feel me if you don't, you don't
I'll feed you to the dogs like a bitch I boned
My only concern is for the cash I gross
A nigga more deadly up against the ropes
Problem dead on tacking tours to throats
Eyes, ears open you can try to get close
Approach me then
Get on the floor soldier like you owe me ten
Spread it, never say it
Action speaks louder than words
Get bodied because you doubted the word
Never fucked your bird, stop askin her
It's not that serious, keep backin up
She'll get curious, and delirious
Send that bitch home on her period
To stop Havoc got to kill me bro
You cats listening but don't hear me though"
Kanye West	5	Last Call	The College Dropout	2004	[Outro]	"So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the ""Truth"" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like ""Who that spittin'?"" I'm like ""It's me."" He's like ""Oh, well okay.""
Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?

Tryna hurry up to get to a baller or singer or somebody like that

In the streets deep, we roll through the city
Looks like it's time to eat, so yo! who's with me?
Strictly, we keep it in the best perspective
Cause nowadays it's more than simply live and let live
A sedative, that's what these headcases need
Them rats'll get trapped soon as they taste the cheese

Cough syrup, I'm infatuated
Got your old girl she infatuated
Call me right now if you need me
I'ma try to be there if you need me
Try my best to be there if you need me

Little bit of joy with a lot of pain
Is he Snoop Lion or Doggy, mayne? (What?)
Ask me again, I'll tell you the same
D-O-Dubb with the key to the city
Me and P, we go, ""Doo-wa-ditty""
Rip down, put my foot down

Fight nights in Vegas
Bright lights, we made it
Slayed it, slightly faded (What?)
Californicated and highly motivated"

You ain't complain when I bought that Maybach
Put you in Chanel, your friend Chanelle can't even say that
You wanted to see Rihanna I put you and your friends at the concert
Closet full of Giuseppes, you came a long way from Converse
Took you out that Hon-cord, put you in that Tom Ford

I know a kid who just passed the other day
They shot him sixteen times, so there he lay
You can pray for this shit to, like, cease
But until then, a nigga's gonna pack a piece
And yo, the devil's got assassination squads
Wanna kill niggas 'cause they're scared of God
They got camps where they train, they learn to take aim
At a nigga like a piece of game
And I'm not seein' that, them days are gone
'Cause now we got chromes to put them where they belong
See me a rude boy from and inna Brooklyn
Fuck the bullshit, pain, and suffering
I'm comin' off with a foolproof plan
As if each and every lyric was worth a hundred grand
I stand in the face of hatred
Lettin' off mad shots, making devils run naked
Tons o' guns"

At the same time, can make you dry your eyes
With the same rhyme, see, what you're seein'
Is a genius at work, which to me isn't work
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first, ‘cause when I speak
It's tongue-in-cheek, I'd yank my fuckin' teeth
Before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums
Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as ""Bump and Grind"" comes on
With more pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade
Standin' on Ronnie's grave, screamin' at the sky
'Til clouds gather; it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
Nine millimeter heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither"
Prodigy	8	Bloodsport	Hell On Earth	1996	[Verse 2]	"Yo, this ain't rap, it's bloodsport
Your life cut short,  you fell short

Dangerous thug minds and brainstorm wars
The life of a wild rebel who run wild, click, blaow (Blaow)
Nigga, lay down, queer, stay down
P'll disappear in hydro cloud
While you runnin' at the mouth a hundred miles, I'm out
Mobb style from the depths of Hempstead, get ninja'd
I creep quiet, keep the live nigga inchin', listen
Who are you to throw your fist in? Hit like a bitch
Run like a faggot and take the whole shit
That's it, I had to pass here with the shit
It's time for showtime, let's see how deep things get
You wanna talk tough and act all delinquent
You find yourself all bloodied up and shamed-ed
Me and my man pioneered this violent nigga rap shit
Bust a gat, kid, me no fear that, I'm laughin'
What's up then? Let's take it there and touch somethin'
I'm a maniac, brainiac, fanatic for that
Capable of combat, P counterattack
In some hot wheels sendin' shots out from the back
It was a foul way to go, Kicko

Some niggas talk out the ass amongst those who live it
Some niggas get money bounce from the hood you shitted
So bitches fuck niggas, they man best dog
Over that now you got some nigga leaking on the floor
Gotta watch those broads
To die over that is totally against the grain and against street laws
I respect paper and every minute it's spent, gettin' that shit
So my little dunn could be set and what I feel about a nigga that's tryna ("
Common	22	Geto Heaven Part Two	Like Water for Chocolate	2000	[Verse 3]	"This music is so much bigger than me
As far as happy, joe, it's like a trigger to me
Dealing with crab rappers, and groupie broads
Record execs, at times it do be hard
But to choose words, and be heard across waters
Doing something you like to support daughters
Keeping your guys from collecting court orders
Conveying messages that the ancestors brought us
Thought of things to say to become the in thing for the day
Somehow, that didn't seem the way for me to make it
Music is a gift that is sacred
I opened it and used it hoping you could grow to it
Whether servant or a surgeon, you gon' go through it
Can't imagine going through it, without soul music
It's like Donnie Hath' helped me see Lonnie's path
On my behalf, let's take whole steps towards hotep
And show depth, as we make people nod
Find heaven in this music and God
Find heaven in this music and God
Find heaven in this music and God"
Big Boi	26	BuggFace	Idlewild	2006	[Verse 2]	"When I'm left alone, I get to thinkin to myself
The mind is a terrible thing to waste, so use it 'til none left
Like everything is alright, clearly tight to def
I can see clearly now, analyzing every step (step)
Clearly you can feel me cause it's beating through yo' chest (chest)
And you can see me clearly through the window, paint drip but wet
With no tint, not deject.. clearly I'm a vet
And not no veterinarian but clearly pit bulls are the best (are the best, are the best)
Like the O.U.T.K.A.S. clearly nigga you know the rest
And if you actin like ya don't, then clearly nigga you tryna test
Crystal clearly I confess and I suggest you clear the runway
Cause the ticket is a one-way, (clearly) back we won't be coming

JAY-Z	6	Girls, Girls, Girls	The Blueprint	2001	[Verse 2]	"I got this young chick, she so immature
She like, ""Why you don't buy me Reeboks no more?""
Like to show out in public, throw tantrums on the floor
Got to toss a couple dollars just to shut up her holla
Got a project chick that plays her part
And if it goes down, y'all, that's my heart
Baby girl so thorough, she been with me from the start
Hid my drugs from the narcs, hid my guns by the parts
I got this model chick that don't cook or clean
But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean
Only thing wrong with ma, she's always on the scene
Goddamn, she's fine, but she parties all the time
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat-back love
So I had to introduce her to the mile high club
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project, and model
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tae Bo
That means I'm new-school, pop pills, and stay in beef
But I never have a problem with my first-class seat, I love"

Nas	9	Project Windows	Nastradamus	1999	[Verse 1]	"Black hoods, cops and projects, sewers flooded with foul blockage
The gutter's wild and every child watches
Chains in top locks get ripped off hinges
Doors kicked off, drunks stag off Smirnoff, wipe your beard off
Crippled dope fiends in wheelchairs stare, vision blurry
'Cause buried deep in they mind are hidden stories
Bet he's a mirror image of that '70s era
He's finished for the rest of his life, 'til he fades out
The liquor store workers miss him but then it plays out
So many ways out the hood, but no signs say out
Mental slave house where gats go off, I show off
Niggas up north, prison-ology talk, 'til they time cut off
You should chill if you short, prepare deep thought
To hit the street again, get it on, get this paper and breathe again
Plan to leave somethin' behind
So your name'll live on, no matter what the game lives on"

He ain't with you, he with Beyoncé, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she pregnant-ated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go into your girl and report that
Main reason 'cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz, you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table, you can't snort that
That go into that, all that money that the court got
All in on that alimony, uh
Yeah-yeah, she got you, homie, yeah

Naw naw, don't try to talk your way out
Because I'm usually non-violent, positively vibin'
But every now and then you got a nigga wanna try you

Big Pun	24	The Dream Shatterer	Capital Punishment	1998	[Verse 1]	"A-yo, I shatter dreams like Jordan, assault and batter your team
Your squadron'll be barred from rap like Adam and Eve from the garden
I'm carvin' my initials on your forehead
So every night before bed, you see the BP shine off the boardhead
Reverse that, I curse at the first wack nigga with the worst rap
'Cause he ain't worth jack
Hit him with a thousand pounds of pressure per slap
Make his whole body jerk back, watch the Earth crack
Hand him his purse back
I'm the first Latin rapper to baffle your skull
Master the flow, niggas be swearin' I'm blacker than coal, like Nat King
I be rappin' in tongues, packin' the ones
Magnums, cannons and Gatling guns
It's Big Pun — the one and only son of Tony Montana
You ain't promised mañana in the rotten manzana
Come on, pana, we need more rhymers
Feel the marijuana, snake bite, anaconda
A man of honor wouldn't wanna try to match my persona
Sometimes rhymin', I blow my own mind like Nirvana
Comma, and go the whole nine like Madonna
Go try to find another rhymer with my kind of grammar"
Big Pun	24	Boomerang	Capital Punishment	1998	[Verse 1]	"Niggas is flossing a lot, time to start extorting the block
Just a portion of the prod' off the top for my Porsche and my yacht
Something for the cops to keep 'em blind
So we can grind with peace of mind
Turn the key and shine without being dimed
Time to expand — New York to Chicago, Colorado
You know my motto: Clock G's and rock keys like Drago
Pablo Escobar and Dom Pérignon
We're buying out the bar and Don Juan and every woman's Chandonin'
Long donging 'em down like Sean Michaels does 'em
I'm like a psycho fucking, sucking the butt like liposuction
Up and down with the tongue twister
C'mon on, sister! Big Pun's Mr. ""Cock and Squeeze"" like a gun tester
Crushing sisters' backs with the demon snap
Hit you from the back, close your eyes, relax, let me feed the cat
Living phat, true mack, niggas was catching feelings
Dealing with a smaller deck, it just wasn't as mass appealing
I started feeling funny, niggas coming short with money
I called my son, he told me, ""Chill!"", he'd be over in twenty
""Punny, what's the deal? Niggas wanna kill me""
He said, ""It's real, they jealous and tired of seeing me Willie silly""
Had more to claim, niggas throwing shit in the game
Gave my wife some pictures with me and bitches running the train
It's like a dream, I called my team and started flipping
Locked the clip in, started lifting niggas off the ground like a magician
I skipped town, be back around when things quiet down
I lost it all for now, but it'll take more to hold me down

And have hoes in the hood sniffing on white lines?
You don't want me to be your kid's role model
I'll teach 'em how to buck them .380s and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce-deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib sipping Guinness watching Menace, then oh Lord
Have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog (Woo)
My team, they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime
You feeling brave, nigga? Go 'head, get gully
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot, so ain't shit you can tell me
Now niggas calling me to feature, man, fuck your money
I ain't hurting, I'm aight, nigga, I'm doing good
I ain't got to write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood"
Kanye West	5	Roses	Late Registration	2005	[Verse 1]	"I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim her heart can't take the anesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin'
Hey, chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was nine?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin', like, ""What kind of doctor can we fly in?""
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now, she'd be okay?
But since she was just a secretary
Working for the church for 35 years
Things 'sposed to stop right here?
My grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse, ""Did you do the research?""
She asked me, ""Can you sign some t-shirts?""
""Bitch, is you smokin' reefer?
You don't see that we hurt?"" But still–"

Stack cheddars forever, live treacherous, all the et ceteras
To the death of us, me and my confidants, we shine
You feel the ambiance, y'all niggas just rhyme
By the ounce, dough accumulates like snow
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show, you feel me?
Factions from the other side would love to kill me
Spill three quarts of my blood into the street, let alone the heat
Fuck 'em, they hate a nigga lovin' his life
In all possible ways, know the Feds is buggin' my life
Hospital days, reflectin' when my man laid up
On the Uptown hot block, he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slippin', this is a minor setback
Yo, still in all we livin', just dream about the get-back
That made him smile, though his eyes said, ""Pray for me""
I'll do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest, it's a slow process (Mm)
And I ain't got nothin' but time
I had near brushes, not to mention
Three shots, close range, never touched me, divine intervention
Can't stop I, from drinkin' Mai-Tai's, with Ty-Ty
Down in Nevada, haha, poppa, word life
I dabbled in crazy weight without rap, I was crazy straight
Partner, I'm still spendin' money from '88, what?"

Niggas be trippin but I'll be pimpin
I don't be trippin off no nigga at all, no bitches
Just tryin to get money, I don't even be trippin off no switches
I used to like low-riders but now I like Eastsiders

I love the Lakers now cos now they got Shaq O'Neal
It's time to make a million dollars and that's for real
See we gone blow up and show up and throw up nuttin but Dogg Pound
Guaranteed to put it down and we'll be 'round to your town
So just sit in your seats and wait 'til we come through
Until we do just keep smokin grey and blue
Or whatever you do just stay true to what you do
Cos we gone keep doin what the fuck we got to do
Now, follow me now and listen to the instructions
Cos the game's gonna get deep now, niggas is tryin ta creep
Tryin ta get up on game but they don't wanna be down with the PG
All of a sudden everybody wanna dis DP
Now, what we look like?
Makin y'all diss us, that ain't right
I should get upset but I'mma stay composed

You was bool with it, wasn't you?
Talkin' 'bout when a nigga gonna leave the block alone
But you never say this shit when I'm fucking you
We was the Huxtables, everything was perfect
Everything was working
We had some beautiful kids together
Had a nigga feeling like everything was worth it
Closet full of Birkins
How you make a nigga spend a million dollars on purses?
Then have an attitude
Like you in the studio helping a nigga write verses
Had a nigga focused on the future, now a nigga feeling like Future
We both dealing with a new nigga 'round our kids
And we ain't kill 'em yet, nigga, I salute you
And I still bang like I used to, red Impala, gold things like I used to
Pick up my kids, they don't see none of that
But when I'm back in the hood I'm yelling soo woo!
And it was all good just a week ago
Shit, we was Nicki and Meek a week ago
Gave you everything, the watch, the house, the cards
Tatted your passport, and now you wanna see me low
Wanna take my pussy, give it to the next nigga free
One thing about the next nigga
He just the next nigga, he can never be me
I'm coming to get my kids and they momma like"

Made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck o', shuck o' corn, Chaka Khan

I've been livin' paranoid, watch your step, uh (Yeah, yeah)"
Common	22	Stolen Moments Pt. III	One Day It’ll All Make Sense	1997	[Verse]	"Fuck waiting under my skin, the situation is scraping
Somewhat like the girl X-rating
It's hard to be patient with no VCR or PlayStation
Knowing your Rockports, somebody may be lacing
Make me wanna leave the city when I can't take a vacation
Without somebody breaking in my demonstration
For some South side information, I search the Nigga-net
It's certain things about this I ain't figure yet
Dirt, the guy who stayed with me and had a set of keys
Because his job had been stopped smoking weed
Thursdays his off days, he usually watch his seed
For him to have done it, a babysitter and a car he would need
The stripper broad, my TV and couch she couldn't carry it
Unless some nigga helped and that's who she'll get buried with
She was vegetarian, she wouldn't have cooked chicken
I confronted her with it, to her story she was sticking
The plot thickens, as we drove in search of this hype
Who I ain't know by name, but I knew by bite
Chances of him breaking in, chilling and eating
Are about as slim as he is, though I knew where he lived
In this house with three kids, one I was cool with
As we rolled, I told the guy turn on the music
Just as I thought I closed in on one suspect
The nigga who did it popped the tape in the deck"
50 Cent	19	Hate It or Love It	The Documentary	2005	[Chorus]	"Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top

Who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes, I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music, I would share it, but, today, I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe"

Big Boi	26	Da Art of Storytellin’ [Part 1]	Aquemini	1999	[Verse 1]	"Somebody hit me the other day for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie and the Dungeon Crew?
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew 'cause she screwed a lot
Makin' a nigga hit that chonk at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats, or things of that nature
Had to hate ya, playa
I'm dickin' the ho down — never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayette all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty — that was shawty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Bimmer 840
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mama beeped me, seven o'clock, it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her, though — maybe she had to work?
I caught her in the mall, wearin' a real tight skirt
She was fine as fuck — I wanted to sex the ho up
She said, ""Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck""
I said, ""Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter, plus my baby mama beeped me, too""
She said she understood and everythin' was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Wil CD and a fuckin' poster
It's like that, now"
Scarface	11	I Seen a Man Die	The Diary	1994	[Verse 1]	"He greets his father with his hands out
Rehabilitated slightly, but glad to be the man's child
The world is different since he's seen it last
Out of jail, been seven years and he's happy that he's free at last
All he had was his mother's letters
Now he's mobile and he's gotta make a change and make it for the better
But he's black so he's got one strike against him
And he's young, plus he came up in the system
But he's smart and he's finally makin' eighteen
And his goal's to get on top and try to stay clean
So he's callin' up his homie who done came up
Livin' lavish, now they dealin' with the same stuff
And had that attitude that who he was was worth land
And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first man
Now it's different, he done did dirt
And realized killin' men meant comin' up but it still hurt
And can't nobody change this
It's 1994 and we up against the same shit"
The Game	13	Let Us Live	LAX	2008	[Verse 3]	"I don't hate Mobb Deep or M.O.P, that was a phase
I was caught up in the beef like a rat in a maze
And my legacy will never be that of a hater
Lyrical rhyme slayer, wack niggas say your prayers
It's the return of Gandhi, Criminal minded city behind me
Put it on my face to remind me
Of all the shit I been through my physical presence, my pen too nice
My first album sent you life
I shoulda put down the mic when Rakim left Dre
No cleanup hitter so I was stranded on second base
I had to steal third, motherfucker that's my word
Then some Queens niggas try to put me back on the curb
I was Ultimate Warrior to you bully ass niggas
I will come through the hood with the fully AK's niggas
Like Snoop or Suge, I'm in the coupe, I'm good
Mothafuckas make way"

The Game	13	Angel	LAX	2008	[Verse 2]	"Th-th-the way that I rhyme blow nigga's mind
Like the first time you heard Mary J. and you were standing in line
To purchase tickets to see her blow like Chicago wind
And I'm ridin' with Common looking for Chicago Zen
And like Chicago winds, I was once a Street Disciple
Rockin' every Jordan shoe, Nike put out by Michael
That made me feel like I could fly, sometimes I wanted to die
Prolly 'cause the angel dust was fuckin with my third eye
So I started hip-hop and I understand why Common used to love her
She got me open so I even had to fuck her
But I used the rubber, 'cause she was married to Rakim
So I bought me a gold chain, pretendin' that I was him
So I can get close to the girl I loved the most
But she left Cali and went on tour with Ne-Yo and Ghost
Big gave her one more chance and she took Big down
I should've knew when Shock G and Pac told me she get around
An angel"

Scarface	11	G’s	The Diary	1994	[Verse 1]	"Roamin' in my motherfuckin' hood and thangs
Seems to me my motherfuckin' hood done changed
'Cause niggas used to kick it with the rival gangs
But now we gots to deal with them survival thangs

Niggas livin' shife, so I roll one deep
'Cause now they see me flippin' in the 1-9-9-4
C.S.I. nigga, black 850
And now they lookin' at me crazy
But off-brand niggas can suck a dick because they can't fade me
And if it came down to the gun, black
I never cracked up under pressure, 'cause I was trained for combat
So get yo' motherfuckin' boys together
I represent S.A., nigga, and we makin' noise forever
And gettin' paid at the same time
So you respect a motherfucker when a motherfucker claim mine
'Cause if you disrespect, you ass out
And they we rollin' through yo' mothafuckin' shit in the Glasshouse

And all the backpack niggas loved me like Mos Def
I'd probably be a cool-ass nigga like Ice Cube
Picture me in this flick right now lookin' so cool
What if I was a low-key nigga, just laid back?
Hustle to keep a homie 'round, somebody to hold the gat
Man what if Halle Berry was my next baby moms?
Shit I'd give that child support up with no problems
If I caught a case and jumped bail I'd get caught
Cause I'm that nigga everybody know from New York
But if I was the new rap nigga you didn't know
You'd be sayin' ""Damn that kid got a sick flow""
What if I just cruised through your hood on 22's
Bumpin' Curtis Mayfield or Marvin, somethin' smooth
And if I let the top down on the Azure
Yeah that'd make you sick to your stomach I'm sure, ha ha"

What would remain? The voice, no doubt
Bless my soul, I control when in pimp mode
My bank roll expands, I invest in my man
I plan to keep rap real
So if your shit ain't phat, then kneel
You squeal, feeling pain from my oral flex
What about oral sex, which chick's next?
To open wide and get a chunk from a real brother
Yeah, some real funk from a real brother
They get sprung and most of them don't recover
But I don't diss 'em, I just talk to 'em
'Cause the sound of my voice, it does a lot to them
So you and the niggas right there
Be aware, like SWV, I'm right here
Waitin' to correct your ass
And if you don't follow now, I'll disrespect your ass
More vicious than Sid, do a crime with no bid
I'll tell a bitch that I didn't when you know that I did
And take a trip to a land afar
Then come back and people still know Gang Starr
See, I'm the ladies' choice
'Cause I got crazy styles, but still it's mostly the voice"

CB4 Gusto, your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out
Montana way, the Good F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'Zé make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes, 32 shotguns
Regulate with my thuns, 17 rocks gleam from one ring
Then let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin', Vegas-style, roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on Millenniums
20G bets I'm winnin' 'em, threats I'm sendin' 'em
Lex with TV sets—the minimum, ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains, a case of Demi-Sec to chase the Henny
Wet any clique with the semi TEC, who want it?
Diamonds I flaunt it, chickenheads flock, I lace 'em
Fried, broiled with basil, taste 'em
Crack they legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have 'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon? Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC, it won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit"

My thugs get packed away, in a maxi-cage
They pass away, they went off the casket way
My gats will spray, but that won't bring 'em back today
So long, my crimes now gone for eternity
The team, we got left on the set, now turn to me
Can't speak, tears in my eyes, revenge in my mind
I ride past the church where they got his body and find
They takin' him to the hearse to put his body in dirt
That's it, pay my respects, wipe my tears with my shirt
Now it's time to do work, out of love and retribution
As loyalty, he would die for me, no excuses
Loadin' clips up, countin' bullets carefully
For self, though it feels like He was there for me
Saw the enemy, I ate him, saw jakes behind me
They ain't knock me, it's obvious that God's watchin' me"

To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?
 Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls
I cut 'em off and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed sunglasses
With Elton John's name on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off
() So tell Laura and her husband to back off
'Fore I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
And launch one of these Russians, and that's all

And I'm a rock a jam by popular demand
You gone love this, it's marvelous, baby
It gotta thug's twist-it start to get crazy
It's off the meat rack- can't keep my peeps back
Speak raps and I freak tracks for these cats
I got a fetish for puttin' together words and letters
It ain't all about the cheddars and y'all know where my head is
Ghetto scriptures for my little brothers and sisters
And still get vicious for the thugs and the Misses
What I don't do is talk about the same old thing
When I come through, I drop it, and they gone swing
I bring the ladies joy until they make crazy noise
Cuz the beat's bangin'- I'm born to blaze, baby boy"

Song Cry to Resentment, that was real crying
Bonnie and Clyde things, we hold it down
Had we surrendered then, that'd be the real crime
Got through it, got blessed times two with it
New Bel-Air estates with four pools in it
I told my bro, ""You gotta go home,"" over vino
Goodfella, don't gamble with your life, this ain't Casino
Cost him two mill' plus the child support
We'll get the money back, but not the child support
It's getting too late, we can't afford mistakes
Woulda broke me down had you got away
It woulda broke me up, you took my child away
I'm glad we found a way
Sexin' the pain away
Vacay the pain away
Drinking the pain away
Smoking the pain away"
Prodigy	8	Family	Nastradamus	1999	[Verse 1]	"Me and my Dunns come from the slums
You can't take the slums out my Dunns
And that's how it is, that's how we live
Sometimes I find myself wearing the same shit for days
Not caring, 'bout what they gon' think or say
I got that I don't give a fuck in me, it's stuck in me
That's how I 'vantage over y'all niggas, y'all too pretty
We too gritty, like Sanford and Son
Too grimy like Pigpen with jewels on
See, we the top rap niggas, the Q-Dogs
You got a lot of nerve putting out them songs
Knowing that my niggas come strong, so let's get it on
We just getting warm, operation Quiet Storm
Silent wars or we silence the fours
Hav, P, and Nas, got it in the smash, fo'sho
Now it's movies and soundtracks
This is where your career stop at"
Kanye West	5	Gone	Late Registration	2005	[Verse 5]	"I'm ahead of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leaving it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime
Light like when I was on the grind
In the 1-9-9-9
Before model chicks was bending over
Or dealerships asked me ""Benz or Rover?""
Man, if I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an eighteen-year-old?
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play your role
My dog worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural
Fired a week later, the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirro'
How we out in Europe, spending Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MCs
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything including the mannequin
They got a new bitch, now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on, I'll handle it, don't start panickin', stay calm
Shorties at the door 'cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said, ""Sorry, Mr. West is gone"""
Scarface	11	I Seen a Man Die	The Diary	1994	[Verse 2]	"Imagine life at its full peak
Then imagine lyin' dead in the arms of your enemy
Imagine peace on this Earth when there's no grief
Imagine grief on this Earth when there's no peace
Everybody's got a different way of endin' it
And when your number comes for souls, then they send it in
Now your time has arrived for your final test
I see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath
How much longer will it be 'til it's all done?
Total darkness at ease be at all one
I watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate
You took his life, but your memory you'll never take
You'll be headed to another place
And the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face"
Eminem	15	Square Dance	The Eminem Show	2002	[Chorus]	"Come on now! Let's all get on down! (Let's dance)

Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout (Join hands)
Let your hair down and square dance with me! (Be free)
Come on now! Let's all get on down! (Let's chill)

50 Cent	19	Stunt 101	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Chorus]	"I teach you how to stunt
My wrists stay rocked up, my TV's pop up in a Maybach Benz

Nigga you can't see me, my Bentley GT got smoke-gray tints

I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya man

André 3000	27	Chronomentrophobia	Idlewild	2006	[Verse 2]	"Lord be having mercy on my soul
I'm having the impression that my life gon' be a bowl
Of cherries, but it's very hard for me to cope
Got tired of being broke
This ATLien ain't got no time to sit and mope
Made up my mind while y'all made up y'all beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I laid my head
Born in 1975, never thought I'd make it this far
Still battling in this racial war
Tryna find solutions to the situation I'm facing
Only thing that's free is my flow that y'all be chasing
Letting my niggas know before I go, I drop that knowledge
Like dropping books; let's stop the crooks
From robbing you of your brains and such
Using welfare as a crutch
I'm in it for good; you enter my hood, you won't be finding much
Hope that when I'm gone, y'all remember this
What we stood for: ""Fuck that fame and that glitz""
It's beginning to look a lot like the ending
And got to be more careful, know what corners you be bending
Revelations, getting impatient, and now, I'm dead
Remember what I said; I'm gone, bow your heads"
Kendrick Lamar	16	gloria	GNX	2024	[Verse 2]	"Said you gon' see other people if I didn't grow with you
Wasn't no more holdin' them pistols in front of stores with you
You want reality, not tragedy, for sure, I get you
To tell the truth, I been pretty used to what open-minded people do
In 2014, I went to Africa, baby, you was my passenger
My eyes and ears for all the years the neighborhood had baffled us
Of course I had to wrap it up, I didn't fully trust you
Fabrication, I disgust you, then you blocked me, I said, ""Fuck you"""
Rakim	10	Uplift	The Master	1999	[Verse 4]	"We all should, from the woods to the big city and the small hood
Everybody should be welcome to the ball if we all could
But we fall cause we brawl, yo it ain't all good
We need to play right, stay tight with ya air alight
Keep your game tight, no need to play trife
Get cheese from the daylight to the late night
And it's shouldn't take death to appreciate life
Before a lot perish, we got to cherish if Allah let us
Get proper nourish 'til the block flourish
In this metropolis, stay on top of this
You know what the prophet is, be prosperous"

Run up in your crib, tie up your bitch
Weigh the bricks and we loco, so broke, brown coke won't sell
Spending your money on weed, smoke and hotels
Hood rats and bullet wound up females
Got babies by hustlers and niggas in jail
Slinging for chips, the fiends with burnt finger tips
Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit
A week later, sporting Gators, getting thrills
By honeys wearing Gucci high heels
She come to scoop me, y'all chill
Leave the streets alone for a sec
Hit the sky bar on sunset, then the sex is so high-tech

Bust a move, we can have a shake and bake-off
Me and you can go 'cause I don't care
Yo, rap fight or guerrilla warfare
We can rumble, 'cause when my lungs go in and out
I kick rhymes in a bundle to win a bout
Or scurry or scuffle
I just muffle the opposition, there's no competition
Let 'em know that Dre is getting stronger
Compton's in the house but now it's some' longer
I won't get set-up, shut up, I'm kinda fed up
You can say uncle and I still won't let up
'Cause Dre is the muthafuckin' doctor

I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my mama I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reapin' everything I sow, so my karma comin' heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfuckin' gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say"
Prodigy	8	G.O.D. Pt. III	Hell On Earth	1996	[Verse 1]	"Alright now, pay attention to the crime rhyme Houdini P
Keeping you niggas in perspective
Mobb representative, call me the specialist
Professional, professor at this rap science
Up in the laboratory, that's why your small rhyme bore me
Your store-bought rap ain't shit, my category
Is that of an insane man who strike back (What?)
I draw first blood, it's over with and that's that
You wanna square off, I'm sayin', ""Slice that cat""
You get splashed from back of your head to asscrack
Searching for signs of the end, well, I am that
Which bring apocalypse to this game called rap
Not a game, but quite serious and yo, in fact
You'll be running for dear life, so far you might fall off the map
Fuckin' with P, you need the gat
At least you had a opportunity to bust back
Fresh out the motherfuckin' pack, a rare world premiere
Shook individuals bounce in blind fear
Scared-to-death niggas fall to they worst fear
Horror tales in Braille for vision-impaired
You lookin' for P, well, you can find him everywhere
In a project near you, I'll be right there
I was brought up and taught to have no fear (Now)
Live wire niggas, they behind me in the rear (Now)
Cowardly hearts, step aside, stand clear (Clear)
My bloodthirsty niggas got they eyes on you (You)

On some hashish, the Embassy Suite, crash your party"

Bustin' bales down in the bath, what the fuck you mean?

My lil' brother'll rob you now, what the fuck you mean?
Drinkin' lean and poppin' tabs, what the fuck you mean?

Boil and burn, two buckets of yearn
Flippin' stickin' fools for chicken, scrapin' the curbs
Scrappin' for the domes straight to the head Thunderbird
I'm on it homey, me and my homegirl Diamond
Down with a nigga damn near before a nigga was rhymin'
Daz, my closest homeboy
California lickin' switches a couple toys
I'm tired retirin' a couple jerseys
Went from the sunny state to Jersey, puffin hershey
Let off, get off, or get spin off
Spit off, set off, spun off the chest
Off the roof, a hundred and seventy-eight proof of boost
Gangster Daz and Kurupt let loose
This is it, short change dip wit us
Sip wit it us, cock your heat or spit wit us"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	The R	Follow the Leader	1988	[Verse 2]	"Somethin' new and to keep you doin' what you're doin'
This is for you and your crew and for who in
The vicinity, I don't need no identity
I see hands in the air, that means many be
Cooperatin', I can't stop relatin'
Hip-hop is makin' more sense when I'm statin'
Paragraphs of potential to prevent you from usin' my instrumental
Keep in mind, I meant to
Illustrate another iller break immediately
Hurry up and learn the words and repeat it with me
Then soon, you're in tune and up to par
And then you're doin' it with The R
Keep doin' it, you keep doin' it with The R"
MC Ren	17	Straight Outta Compton	Straight Outta Compton	1988	[Verse 2]	"Straight outta Compton, another crazy-ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this
But the pussy-ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking or craps
Just like burglary, the definition is jacking
And when I'm legally armed it's called packing
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand, 'cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull an AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw
See, 'cause I'm the motherfucking villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's taking place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton

Lloyd Banks	34	Beg For Mercy	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Verse 3]	"I'm tired of you niggas with your maybe beef
We gon' be here forever, you're temporary like baby teeth
I'm in and out the night clubs, eighty deep
Dark blue Benz, navy seats, eighty sneaks
These niggas tellin' out the blue
So you hang 'em off the bridge, police'll have to helicopter you
The Jimmy lived in the bags, the Bellhop will do
I rap for the neighborhood niggas that failed in high school
You can tell I came a long way in my sense, home grown
That's why them little niggas in the projects love me
You provide the beat downs for free, I paid my dues
I don't even freestyle for free
I gave 'em a break, flew over seas
But it's kinda hard to get homie-sick when there's blue in the trees
Sit back and try to play your role
The doctors'll put more staples in yo' ass than a telephone pole
Yeah!"
Big Boi	26	Aquemini	Aquemini	1998	[Verse 3]	"The name is Big Boi, Daddy Fat Sax, the nigga that like them Cadillacs

We missed a lot of church, so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nutsacks, you bust 'round, we bust back
G—Get back for real niggas that's out here tryna spit facts

I got that nigga Dre, he ridin' shotgun
And got my pump under my seat in case these youngsters wanna have some fun
I'll do it if I have to, bustin' caps with this here heater
Loadin' clip up after clip, I'm packin' my gauge if I feel it
The Glock, the gat, the nine, the heater
See, I be bustin' caps like my amp be bustin' speakers
So how do you figure that Big Boi be scared to blast you?
You 'posed to be the quickest draw, my man, well, hail 'em faster
Uh, one, two, three, you need to think about the future
Before I shoot your ass and dilute your blood with lead
From my hollow tips, I'll send you to an early grave
You fuckin' slave, you better try another way
To take me out is truly somethin' difficult
Don't even run up on me unless you want your brain broke
I'm out of bullets, lettin' loose my last clip

I'm gettin' what you get for a brick to talk greasy (Woo)
By any means, partner, I got to eat on these streets
When you play me close, for sure I'm gonna pop my heat

Eminem	15	Rhyme or Reason	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 1]	"My mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle, then crashed in
The side of loco-motive with rap, I'm
Loco, it's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
'Bout to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap, ""In a spasm
Your music usually has 'em
But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't
Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan.""
A Jedi in training, colossal brain and
Thoughts are entertainin'
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage, I need a seein' eye dog
Can't even find the page I was writing this rhyme on
Oh, it's on the ram-page
Couldn't see what I wrote, I write small
It says, ""Ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with whitewalls
Had a fire in my heart
And a dire desire to aspire to Die Hard.""
So as long as I'm on the clock, punching this time card
Hip-hop ain't dying on my watch"
Rakim	10	We’ll Never Stop	The Master	1999	[Verse 3]	"I extend the prowl I been on since a child
It don't make sense to browse, it's intensive now
Women in crowds, I search for the gem in the Nile
Who stay original, even when the friends around
Since her style always commands a smile
And her femme fatale cause men to growl
I take president of principal, then arouse
Still the treasure is Rakim, the smooth criminal
Damn, it's on, keep my hands on this amazon
Legs for marathons
Voice like Sarah Vaughan
Precise, alright
I like when her sights entice, with a spice of life
Flow times twice as nice
And when she go shop, the show stop
Shock the whole block
She so hot, I clothes shop, put it on lock
Body that won't drop, bounce like hip-hop
It don't stop"

Take it from TS's top terrorist
Rapper slash hijacker, bombin' tracks ever since
I was young, I wasn't always Big Pun
It wasn't always this fun, ay-yo, I rose from the slums
I had to pay my due, lay a few
But I ain't sayin' who, stayin' true to the game
No names, playin' it cool, just me and the crew

Their security system's linear laser protection
No sweat, I brought the miniature mirrors for reflectin'
Inspectin' the vault for weapon's assault, second of course
It's poison, it sprays, boiled and baked in Epsom salt
Reppin' New York, it's the cat burglar, the fat murderer
Slippin' the clip in the MAC, inserterer
Hurtin' your pockets, droppin' your stock to zero profit
Holdin' heroes hostage and mansions for ransom like De Niro mob flicks
Back to the topic at hand, the grand prize
The safe flies open, the shine almost blinded my eyes
I cracked the code, enough ice to make you laugh at gold
Passed the dough to Cuban, started movin' for the back, let's go
That's when I heard the sirens, hopin' that my ears was lyin'
Knew we was dyin' when I saw the guard we tortured cryin'
Pointin' at the building screamin', ""I can see them, kill 'em!""
Snipers was willing but couldn't, there's too many civilians
Still inside, nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
Cuban said, ""Fuck it, we die, we die busting our guns"""
Rakim	10	When I’m Flowin	The 18th Letter	1997	[Verse 2]	"When I'm flowin, theoretically speakin like a drummer
I take you through the streets to the parks in the summer
Or illustrate, a time and place you never been in
And make you focus on the future after seein the beginning
And my style wilds, like Miles on the trumpet
Volume dial was kind of low, need to pump it
Up another notch turn the dial til it stops
More watts you got, more things to watch
Third eye's wide open, you're focused on the theory
Keep scopin til you hear me, words is spoken clearly
It's no smokescreens on the scenes that I'm showin
Man I keep it goin, damn I keep it flowin"

Kanye West	5	Drive Slow	Late Registration	2005	[Verse 1]	"My homie Mali used to stay at 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me ""K-Rock"" so they'd leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' something, sixteen, he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure! nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back— back then— then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had them Lincolns and auroras, we was hurtin' 'em all
With the girls, a lot of flirting involved, but, dawg
Fuck all that flirting, I'm tryna get in some drawers
So put me on with these hoes, homie
He told me, ""Don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie"""
MC Ren	17	If It Ain’t Ruff	Straight Outta Compton	1988	[Verse 3]	"The 'do not disturb' sign is in effect
While I'm thinkin of a fool to select
To give the victim the verdict so for the verdict a victim
Slammin' my vocals on a dance with the rest then I kick them
Tell 'em they're guilty, and peep out the bailer
And get a new track o' drums so I can play with
Percussion, pumpin' it loud when I perform
Yo, you wanna play in my game, put on a uniform
It ain't a rule in the book you have to go by
Hey, cause when it comes to cheatin', yo, you should know I
For fear in the hearts cause it's the hearts full of fear
Coz what you hear in your ear is something funky and clear
The Hulk was incredible yo but Ren he was super
But now I'm ruthless, a civilian and not a trooper
But a soldier with a top rankin
Givin' dope material, the hell with the gankin'
So play like an airplane and just jet
And keep your blood pressure low cause I'm a threat, cause if not
I'm afraid of the show
That you're a sucker and you're too nervous to go"
Dr. Dre	1	Housewife	2001	1999	[Verse 1]	"I mostly sold dick while I packed a gold clip
Worked my money-maker, she got paper, she 'bout to trip
(Where the fuck is my money?) I cannot G guilty
You pimpin' strong, but comin' home to sheets that be filthy
She on the dillzy, I take advantage
All up in them panties, I got this bitch speakin' Spanish
I'm mannish, get yo' nails out my back
Slut, I'm 'bout to nut and get up, go scrub yo' cat (Get the fuck out of here)
Learn the player rules, this is how a player do
Might not be a freak, but she got on the choosin' shoes
Dollar signs are folded, I can't control it
Tryin' to leave her, beeper just exploded
She sweatin' me, won't let me, broad turned fraud
Now she on this dick, huh, got her turnin' tricks, huh
Man, it's a trip, I don't trip, I'm in yo' Lexus flexin'
I left her up in Dallas, Texas, ass naked"
Kanye West	5	Jesus Walks	The College Dropout	2004	[Verse 2]	"To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers
(Jesus walks with them)
To the victims of welfare, feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah
(Jesus walks with them)
Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models, we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about His facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God, my record won't get played, huh?
Well, if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope it take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' 'bout
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out"
JAY-Z	6	Izzo (H.O.V.A.)	The Blueprint	2001	[Verse 3]	"Yeah, Hov is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack (Yeah)
Like I told you sell drugs, no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin' they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game, the two things that's great
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
What else can I say about dude? I gets busy"
Eminem	15	Headlights	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 2]	"‘Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry, Mama, for ""Cleanin' Out My Closet""
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it, though
‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and
How I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's takin' over
And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
And I'm way too old to cry, this shit is painful, though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers
Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps
And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me
That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left, I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a
Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to
Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'
So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that
I will always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom"
Common	22	My Way Home	Late Registration	2005	[Verse]	"They say home is where the hate is, my dome is where fate is
I stroll where souls get lost like Vegas
Seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
Pray to God that my arms reach the masses
The young smoke grass in grassless jungles
Rubber band together in cashless bundles
We wear strugglin' chains, divided only hustle remains
Makin' sense of it, we hustle for change
Revolution ain't a game, it's another name for life fightin'
Someone to stay in they corner like Mike Tyson
Hypes fightin' for hits to heighten they hell
Don't he know he could only get as high as he fell?
Show money becomes bail, relationships become jail
Children are unheld
I wish love was for sale, ""Behold the Pale - Horse""
Got me trapped like R. Kel', I bail and it—"
Eminem	15	Insane	Relapse	2009	[Chorus]	"If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!"
Rakim	10	Uplift	The Master	1999	[Verse 6]	"Ghetto alert, let's do whatever work to get rid of the curse
We went from 1st to America's worst
On this competitive turf, now let's inherit the earth
There's more prize for one another, and call shots
12:00 o'clock 'til the next ball drop
All year around plus they shuffle nonstop
You think it's rough at the bottom, it's even rougher on top
My peeps gonna have to reach and turn for me
And everybody's side of the street'll be sunny
Ain't nothing funny, burn plenty and burn money
And earn money and watch the century turn 20"
Travis Scott	33	THANK GOD	UTOPIA	2023	[Verse 2]	"Got God on the line

It wasn't made easy

We gotta go now"
50 Cent	19	God Gave Me Style	The Massacre	2005	[Bridge]	"It ain't my fault, I just reach for style

Common	22	Nuthin’ to Do	Resurrection	1994	[Verse 2]	"I got more rhymes than The Manor got folks
Had style since I went to McDowell, wearin' boats
And penny loafers though I had the nickel in mines
We use to hoop in my yard but now I dribble the rhyme
It's like rain drops couldn't make our game stop
Skeeter would hit from the same spot
'til Marlon tore my shit down, get down
Put your body in motion only the strong survive
But on the 6 or the 5
Live is how the sets used to be, at the Racquet
Ball Club with music by, Andre Hatchett
Or either a beat by Pharris at them country club parties
We'd be hot as hell and House studs would yell ""Aight, now money!""
Sauers I would go there, hip-hop clubs were so rare
I liked the music anyways and it was always hoes there
Whitney Young and Kenwood was said to have the best chicks
But mostly Hyde Park and V hoes is who I messed with
The best shit was troopin' to the loop in your precisions
Cut class to get ass, but still go to division (I remember that)
Over Yamela's crib while his old girl was at work
Bust a spoolie on the spread, but still have some on your shirt"
2Pac	18	Me and My Girlfriend	The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory	1996	[Verse 2]	"My girlfriend blacker than the darkest night
When niggas act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
Nigga, my girlfriend, though we separated at times
I knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine
Picked you up when you was 9
Started out my life of crime with you
Bought you some shells when you turned 22
It's true, nothin' compares to the satisfaction
That I feel when we out mashin'; me and my girlfriend"
50 Cent	19	Stunt 101	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Chorus]	"I teach you how to stunt

Nigga you can't see me, my Bentley GT got smoke-gray tints
I teach you how to stunt
My neck stay blinging, my rims stay gleaming, I'm shining, man
I teach you how to stunt
I see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya man
I teach you how to stunt"
Big Boi	26	Chonkyfire	Aquemini	1998	[Verse 2]	"To make one bob they head would be the track job
Your job's to spit that fire
Some of y'all MC's take this rhymin' for granted, I won't comply
With that slackin', poppin' and crackin' fourth ward say we snappin'
They want that hardness that oddness that gets a nigga to start this
What's happenin', see if I do what you won't do today boy
Will I live tomorrow like you can't even live 'cause you strayed
Motivational skills lackin', when I see you nigga you packin'
Understand that though, you behind a $75,000 car doe
But still stay with mom though, playing the King like Don doe
You choked up, you was the nigga that supposed to be so locced up
Makin' them think Hip Hop is dead, exhume the body if you ain't scared
And if I see you in the streets I'd dap you down like you was Greg, yeah"

Same time a man is murdered — the beginnin' and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau and also what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10's to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustlin' for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs livin' large, takin' it light
Pushin' big toys, gettin' nice, enjoyin' your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course, N-A-S are the letters that spell... (Nas, Nas, Nas)"

Ridin' 'round in one of Dre's Ferraris, nigga
Oh, matter of fact, I might be in Detroit ridin' down 8 Mile Road
You know, to one of Em's joints and shit (Ha-ha)

And the over here's are the older things
Can see the bell but don't know the rings
The rings are not sounds, but circles, wear these on your virtues
See through these circles just like Steve Urkel, 'til it's all universal
And it harmonize in like proportion to the larger size
And it's dynamic in the high standard
So each degree has a part to price
See big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity
And little whirls have lesser worlds and so on to viscosity"
Havoc	7	Eye for a Eye (Your Beef Is Mines)	The Infamous	1995	[Verse 2]	"A-yo, I gotta get mines, no matter what the consequences
Count all my blessings, add up my weapons
Cock back the gat and let my 9 serve purpose
Sling, do my thing, organize fiend servants
Tryna make a mill is stress, you know the deal
So we sling krills, get your cap peeled, 'cause everythin' is real
Cuz, I wanna chill, laid up in a Jacuzzi
Sippin' bubbly, with my fingers on the Uzi
Try to infiltrate my fort, get caught, dead up in New York
My brain is packed with criminal thoughts
Get your life lost, never found again, my friend
Mission completed, watch you drop in less than ten
On my road to the riches, hittin' snitches off with mad stitches
Your last restin' place'll be a ditch, kid!
No one can stop me — try, your style's sloppy
You wanna be me? You're just an imitation copy
My theme is all about makin' the green
Livin' up in luxury, pushin' phat whips and livin' comfortably"

When you bust a nut, niggas be duckin' or takin' numbers
Love to watch you at a block party, beggin' for drama
While unleashin' on the old-timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
The only girl that I adore, everything I'm askin' for
Talkin' to me, beggin' me to just take you around
Seventeen, like Brandy you just Wanna Be Down
Talkin' loud when I tell you be quiet
You move the crowd, bustin' rounds, activatin' a riot
That's why I love you so, no control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit, you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby, witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home: me and my girlfriend"

Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that"

Chasin' beavers? Nah, I don't ever have to do that
P.I. till I die, and then I laugh at you cats
You happy perhaps ‘cause you got dough and bitches
But no love in the streets, only from 'mos and snitches
Only from the meat-lappin', suckers won't see it happen
Cross that line, then it's time for the heat-clappin'

Kendrick Lamar	16	You Ain’t Gotta Lie (Momma Said)	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 1]	"I could spot you a mile away
I could see your insecurities written all on your face
So predictable your words, I know what you gonna say
Who you foolin'? Oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
With the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
Circus acts only attract those that entertain
Small talk, we know that it's all talk
We live in the Laugh Factory every time they mention your name"
Eminem	15	The Way I Am	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Verse 2]	"Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song Guilty Conscience has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at?
And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see
An upper-class city havin' this happenin'
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way, but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned"
Prodigy	8	Get Away	Infamy	2001	[Verse 3]	"But you walkin' that thin line
I'm clapping you first time for a motherfucker tryin'before it's too late, go at your gut

Kanye West	5	Blood On the Leaves	Yeezus	2013	[Chorus 2]	"You could've been somebody
We could've, ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyer?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'nolia"
JAY-Z	6	Heart of the City (Ain’t No Love)	The Blueprint	2001	[Verse 3]	"Then Richard Pryor go and burn up
And Ike and Tina Turner break up
Then I wake up to more bullshit
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me
Now that I'm successful, you'll pull this shit
Nigga, I'll step on your porch, step to your boss
Let's end the speculation, I'm talkin' to all of y'all
Males shouldn't be jealous, that's a female trait
What, you mad 'cause you push dimes and he sell weight?
Y'all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy bigger plates
Haha, and more baggies, why you all aggy?
Nigga, respect the game, that should be it
What you eat don't make me shit
Where's the love?
Where's the love?"
Dr. Dre	1	Express Yourself (Extended Mix)	Straight Outta Compton	1988	[Verse 3]	" (Express yourself)
From the heart if you wanna start to move up the chart then
Expression is big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow, you ain't swift
Movin' like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of them expression
And if you start fessin', I got a Smith & Wesson for ya
I might ignore your record, because it has no bottom
I get loose in the Summer, Winter, Spring and Autumn
It's Dre on the mic gettin physical
Doin' the job, NWA is the lynch mob
Yes I'm macabre, but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growin' just like a fetus
Or a tumor, but here's the rumour, Dre's in the neighborhood and he's up to no good
When I start expressin myself, Yella slam it
'Cause if I stay funky like this, I'm doin' damage
Or I'mma be too hyped, I need a straight jacket
I got knowledge, and other suckers lack it
So when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like, it's like we gettin' hype tonight
'Cause if I strike, It ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just
(express yourself)"

If he was doin' bad, kill Superman
Tied to a log, pushed into a saw
Take a little dog, right through the fan
And it mean man, like a dictionary
Like a definition, like you never listen
Not the ""ition"" endin', but the deaf part
Break it in half, like an intermission
You'll see then, what I mean then
Or what I meant there, doesn't impair
Now you're learnin' it, keep rehearsin' it
'Til it's permanent, like pimp hair
Got an empire, I'm the emperor
Like the cat were, I'll be faster
You're tryin' to add syrup, just to slow me down
But I blow 'em down, like I'm half-were
That's wolf-man, you got a full house
I got a full moon, then I pull out
The ace up my sleeve, like my hand hurt
Lend me your chips, what they took now
What they put now, gotta look down
And check your shoulder, cause I'll be over
Like a boater, you got boulders
In your loafers, put your foot down
While I Ottoman, or a Laz-E-Boy
Or a handstand, see I elevate
Like Otis, my toes is
And my flow sick, let it marinate
Try to break it down, might take a while
All good though, I'll wait around
While you chase it down, that white rabbit
Down that long hole, like paper towels (yeah homey)"

Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch

Nas	9	Stillmatic (The Intro)	Stillmatic	2001	[Verse]	"Ayo, the brother's Stillmatic
I crawled up out of that grave, wipin' the dirt, cleanin' my shirt
They thought I'd make another Illmatic
But it's always forward I'm movin'
Never backwards, stupid, here's another classic
C-notes is fallin' from the sky, by now the credits roll
They're starrin' Nas, executive poet, produced, directed by
The Kid slash Escobar, narration describes
The lives of lost tribes in the ghetto tryin' to survive
The feature opens with this young black child, fingers scratched
Cigarette burns on the sofa, turnin' the TV down
While Mary Jane Girls, 45's playin', soft in the background
Food from C-Town's, mornings was hash browns
Stepped over dope fiends, walkin' out the door, all of us poor
I learned the difference 'tween the snitches
The real ones, and who's soft, and the murderous, hungriest crews
People jumpin' from roofs
Shotguns pumpin', made it through my youth
Walkin' very thin lines, ages seven and nine
That's the age I was on my album cover, this is the rebirth
I know the streets thirst water like Moses
Walkin' through the hot desert searchin' to be free
This is my ending and my new beginning, nostalgia
Alpha and Omega places, it's like a glitch in The Matrix
I seen it all, did it all, most of y'all will pop for a minute
Spit a sentence then the game'll get rid of y'all
Y'all got there but y'all ain't get it all, I want my style back
Hate to cease y'all plan, it's the rap–repo man
To them double up hustlers, bidders, niggas who real
Professional stick-up kids dreamin' for mils
Let my words guide you, get inside you
From Crips to Pirus, this is survival"
André 3000	27	She’s Alive	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse]	"The year was 1975
That night crickets cried
They knew what was goin' down
Three girls travel a long country road
And one said she thinks it's time
This baby wants to come right now"
Rakim	10	Remember That	The 18th Letter	1997	[Verse 2]	"I remember the spots that used to be hot
Just like the rooftop, a place that only few can rock
On a wild-ass block, yeah, you'd find me there a lot
Until you hear gunshots, that's when the fun stops
Here come the cops, time to go home, get in order
'Cause I'll be back in Manhattan if something's happenin' at the Latin Quarter
House of havoc when it came to fourteen carat
And if you had it, yeah, kids'd try to grab it
It's cool at the Red Parrot, we was doin' it there
I was the first one to rip it at the Union Square
Me and DJ Red Alert did work
A crazy concert, a lot of kids got hurt
I did encores at the Encore, they wanted more
I kicked a freestyle 'til I heard the crowd roar
Like the Funhouse, Bronx Center, never endin', Black
Place to be was the Brooklyn Armory, remember that?"

50 Cent	19	Ryder Music	The Massacre	2005	[Verse 3]	"My mama gave birth to a winner, I gotta win
Pray the Lord forgive me for my sins (Uh-huh), I'm still thugging
Cruising, rims gleaming like the stones on my wrist
Zoning—guess this is how it feels to be rich, homie
You hustlin' backwards if you chasin' a bitch, stupid
Chase the paper they come with the shit
I'm falling... in love with success
Entrepreneur, connoisseur, I maneuver the best
Rolling Ruger on my lap, rubber grip on the handle
Stunner, have your homies burning Rest-in-Peace candles
As wise men speak, I listen and learn
A man dies, a baby's born, my nigga, the world turns
Rappers, I make 'em sick when I say I'm the shit
They mistake my confidence for arrogance, they hate on the kid
In '99, I had a vision and made a decision
Being broke is against my religion, now I'm caked up, what!"
MC Ren	17	Quiet On Tha Set	Straight Outta Compton	1988	[Verse 4]	"Now MC Ren is here working like super glue
No matter what I do, I'm always stickin' to you
'Cause I'm the pusher, supplying the fix
And this jam's so dope, it don't need a remix
But I'm making obstacles of enemy traps
To catch any MC's with the weakest raps
Crucifyin in vain like just for usin' my name
The definition is pain, but that's the thing o' the game
If they try to retreat, I catch'em one at a time
'Cause they're comittin' a crime, and still promotin' a rhyme
So, you in the back of me just listen and learn
Because you'll all get a chance or maybe a turn
Now my assignment was to give a preview
So at my next concert I wanna see you there
Not sittin' in a chair, standin' on both feet with yo hands in the air
Now I'm about to jet out but I'll be back
But next time expect a more funkier track
Deep down for your enjoyment to hear more percussion
With lyrics that's smooth to start some discussion
The prove that I'm hype and you know that's bet
Now continue to dance coz I'm thru with tha set"

Tears and sweat
And you breakin' your neck
And you still up in debt
Walkin' round town all strapped in
Niggas be havin' more bad times than Captain Rat did
Two strikes none left, out of breath
Livin' in the city it's a jungle yo
All this deception on top of stress
You havin' more problems than a algebra test
You can't seem to come up, wit yo' money for rent
And now yo' baby momma trippin' she want fifty percent
It's a thin line, between yours and mine
The difference is you gotta scratch to a get nickel and dime
Now I know a place where
Ya' might wanna be and I can take you there
Pop goes the nine, leave all that behind
You can slide off your shoes sit back and recline"
Eminem	15	Eminem - My Mom (ترجمه فارسی)	Relapse	2009	[Chorus]	"My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs

Eric B. & Rakim	14	No Competition	Follow the Leader	1988	[Verse 3]	"Creator, the alphabets, let's communicate
When I translate, the situation's straight
No dictionary's necessary to use
Big words do nothing but confuse and illuse
From the first step, my concept is kept
To the end of the rhyme, it get more in-depth
All thoughts I come across, my mind's the source
Made by the R, of course
Seven holes in my face as I'm looking out my window
Speak with the beat and it seems like the wind blows
Through the speakers, I hear it, so pump this
And we can fill up the whole circumference
With competition, on an impossible mission
Coming up with nothing, keep fishing
No runner up, just lost or forfeits
They all get butterflies soon as the door gets
Unlocked, line for blocks and blocks
Might be trifling to call the cops
Bring along paramedics
But that won't help you, not even calisthenics
I'm God, G is the seventh letter made
Reining on rappers, it's no parade
So if you ain't wise, then don't even come"
Travis Scott	33	HOUSTONFORNICATION	ASTROWORLD	2018	[Pre-Chorus]	"Ain't never freein' up and never let y'all, man

Life is just a maze, goin' through my phases (Yeah)"
JAY-Z	6	4:44	4:44	2017	[Verse 1]	"Look, I apologize, often womanize
Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
""Please come back to Rome, you make it home""
We talked for hours when you were on tour
""Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!""
I said: ""Don't embarrass me"" instead of ""Be mine""
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn its death and
I apologize for all the stillborns
'Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
'Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize 'cause at your best, you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize"

All for respect, all for the bread
For the chance of success they might hand him his head

Plus the road is tough, especially when you roll with us
But I'ma stay with my peeps, stay in these streets

I'd never have no motherfuckin' indo to smoke
I gets loced and loony, bitch, you can't do me
Do we look like BBD, you hoochie groupie?
I have no love for hoes
That's somethin' that I learned in Tha Pound, so how the fuck am I supposed
To pay this ho just to lay this ho?
I know the pussy's mines, I'ma fuck a couple more times
And then I'm through with it
There's nothin' else to do with it, pass it to the homie, now you hit it
'Cause she ain't nothin' but a bitch to me
And y'all know, that bitches ain't shit to me
I gives a fuck, why don't y'all pay attention?
Approach her with a different proposition
I'm Kurupt, ho, you'll never be my only one

Common	22	A Song for Assata	Like Water for Chocolate	2000	[Verse 2]	"It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
Walkie-talkies crackling, I see them when they're taking her
Though she kind of knew
What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
Arrived to Middlesex Prison about 6 in the morning
Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in
A cell, one cot, no window, facing hell
Put in the basement of a prison with all males
And the smell of misery, seatless toilets and centipedes
She'd exercise, paint, and begin to read
Two years in a hole, her soul grew weak
Away from people so long she forgot how to speak
She discovered freedom is a unspoken sound
And a wall is a wall and can be broken down
Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with
One of the brothers she had a child with
The foulness they would feed her, hoping she's lose her seed
Held tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed
In need of a doctor, from her stomach she'd bleed
Out of this situation a girl was conceived
Separated from her, left to mother the Revolution
And lactated to attack hate
'Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate
Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
They fabricated cases, hoping one would stick
And said she robbed places that didn't exist
In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites
Through dark halls of hate she carried the light
I wonder what would happen if that would've been me
All of this just so we could be free
Yeah, I often wonder what would happen if that would've been me
All of this just so we could be free
So dig it, people"

What can make a nigga wanna do another nigga wife?
Like a butter knife
What can make a nigga wanna get his body so high
That can't go to sleep, don't wanna eat?
Pray to God that he don't do crack
What can make a nigga wanna cut a beauty queen raw
Feeling every drip drop she can generate, imitate seesaws?
What can make a nigga wanna fight a whole night club?
Figure that he ought to maybe be a pimp
Simply cause he don't like love
What can make a nigga wanna achy, break all rules?
In a book when it took a lot to get you hooked up to this volume?
What can make a nigga wanna lose all faith in
Anything that he can't feel through his chest wit' sensation? Ahh"

Same way that Venus did, Serena did, we them kids
Whitney was talking 'bout, that's how it was
Before my brother caught them slugs and I watched coroners chalk him out
That ain't my brother in that box, what niggas talking 'bout?
Couldn't Paul Bearer 'cause I was too weak to walk him out
And that's real shit, I'm dedicated
Like Pac was to Jada before Jada met Will Smith
I'm already turnt up, chronic still burnt up
Fuck outta here, with all that lean and popping pills shit
Jump in my Impala get it hopping with a kill switch
I done been around the world, my life is like a field trip
I done been to Africa, seen niggas in Attica
Cops killing our youth, these numbers ain't adding up
Like that white boy sitting in a prison cell
Killed 9 people in a church, how he living still?
I couldn't understand, I spent hours
With Farrakhan, just begging him to let me be the millionth man
But some of these niggas just make you wanna kill a man
And let the .38 spin like a ceiling fan
Separate your body from soul, soul from Earth
Roll a blunt with your remains and then ash it in the dirt
Listen, you ain't a Christian 'cause you go to church
Listen, you ain't a gangster 'cause you got the work
A real gangster's one who take care of his whole family
Like me, even though my baby mama can't stand me
Her name tattooed on my neck, nigga it's branded
And my fucking kids tighter than Ray J and Brandy
Yeah, I give it to you so you understand
Fucking bitches took my family"

As I'm pumpin' hype rhymes in your heads
The mic's a remote control and I'm pointin' it at ya
When I push buttons, you're gonna have ta
Break straight to the floor
'Cause I'ma make more
Each one's composed in the shows and each one flows
How long? Nobody knows
And whoever try to take 'em, I'ma break 'em
Drag it out of him, dehydrate 'em
The beat makes the beat in your heart accelerate
Your pulse is a drumroll, too late to wait
A pen'll send adrenaline to ten
If then begin to blend the smooth that's sent
That's to prevent you from gettin' asthma
You try to keep up, because, the cut has ya
Blood pressure to the point, never stops a drop
Puttin' stain in the veins in the brain, your blood clots
Too quick to pause it, you almost lost it
So, kick along til you're all exhausted
And look what my data made, my power'll never fade
I keep it energetic, or hype as Gatorade
Now kick it with a beat
C'mon, kick along"
Big Boi	26	Snappin’ and Trappin’	Stankonia	2001	[Verse 2]	"My Cadillac got that boom, boom in it, listen to it drop
Like cereal in your breakfast bowl just jumpin' off the top
A nigga don't stop for squares or octagons prepare
I'm not the one you scared, the Piccolo Pimp done set up shop
Nigga you pop lock, for pop rocks, but I'm only poppin tweeters
And woofers and pussies be blowing purple wit' my feet up
I'mma eat up anybody who tests this, I'm blessed wit'
Super human powers, poke your chest in, the next of kin
Gone be the first one like some Mexicans to buck
Nigga you stuck like a truck in red dirt, you's in church
And I'm the deacon speakin' while ya tweakin'
The preacher preachin', reachin', teachin' speakin', being, breathin'
You're not, your clock stop, and now you're laying in a pretty box
And now the pastor is only talking 'bout the pretty parts of your life
Your brother fuckin' your damn wife
You look for the pearly white gates, but you realize your fate
It's too late, cause you hate, you hate
It's too late, cause you hate
Punk pussy ass bitch, game over, (What you wanna do?) who want some?!"

Havoc and P — Queens niggas, so it seem to be
Monopolize, strategies of war, exercise
Mega got word back from Noreaga
The D.A. got video cassette tape of
The god with the God-U-Now, pullin' a caper
Runnin' up in the spot, mask and duct taped up
Pig-tie they motherfuckin' wrists to they ankles
I been through, crime shit my niggas into
Peep the issue, situation like this, we stickin' him too
JFK on our way to L.A. 
Got links with big cats down in Santa Barbré
My crew do it the Mobb way, every day
Crime pay, who wanna gunplay? Thrill me
Niggas kill me, grillin' me, you wanna look? Peep the nine milli
Now undress, you know the drill-y
Niggas suspect, weak links pose threats
I have yet to met challenger who go against my set
Gemstars razor sharp like Gillette
Shavin' closely on any character approach me
I let the streets get the best of me, infamy, my destiny
While cat burglars tryna sneak-peek the recipe
Inside my rap cookbook, paragraphs is gourmet
You pay about $5,000 a plate"

Girls neither
You ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you
You don't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin', I don't squash the beef
You better kill me
I'ma be another rapper dead for poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me
I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too
You ain't nothin' but a girl to me
Bitch, I'ma kill you"

Kendrick Lamar	16	​good kid	good kid, m.A.A.d city	2012	[Verse 1]	"Look inside these walls and you see I'm havin' withdrawals
Of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away
I should ask a choir: ""What do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?""
As the record spin I should pray
For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity buildin', it's prob'ly big as a buildin'
Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe
But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain't
But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walkin' from Bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind 'cause one day you'll respect
The good kid, m.A.A.d city"

Dick is the bomb, about as thick as an arm""
Mr. Exxon, gas 'em with the wit and the charm
Bitch, I'm trying to tell you like Nicholas Barnes
I'm a big cat, listen mami, can you dig that?
Cars, jewelry, homes, I did that
O's, shootouts, keys, I live that
Actresses, models, chicken heads, hit that
I get stacks and still I kick back
And run up on niggas with the m-id-ac, where the shit at?"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	Musical Massacre	Follow the Leader	1988	[Verse 2]	"Never tired, don't even try it, keep quiet
Like a storm, you could rain, but I riot
Remains and gains power just like The Towering Inferno
The beat's gonna burn, so
Distance is kept, you better watch your step
Volunteers go from here and get
Ya out of the flames, pre-heat, the temperature change
Anywhere within the range of Celsius
Fahrenheit on the mic might melt, see it
Burns soon as it's felt, see, it's
Torchin', scorchin', mic's pipin' hot
Steamin', who's schemin'? Nah, ya not
James Brown must've been dusted, disgusted
Now he can't be trusted
Embalmed with fluids, static can cause explosion
In fact, impact's closin' in
Time was up, so I release a time bomb
Beat gives me a heat-stroke, but I rhyme calm
Pull out the tool, sometimes I wanna break fool
But I was cool like one in the chamber
Let's play a game of rhymin' roulette
Then put me up to your brain, then name a rhyme about ya clout
One mistake, ya out
If this is demonstration, it can't be the same show
Maybe you're too fly, somewhere over the rainbow
Courage, heart, and brain, you need rhymes
Turn on your mic, snap your fingers three times, you're gone
Or the story won't end the same, and you'll feel the flame
The potion was weak, make another antidote
What's the science? Why can't ya quote?
Elements for musical intelligence, rhymes are irrelevant
No development, and that settles it
Go manufacture a match, send me after a blast
Of a master that has to make Musical Massacre"
Eminem	15	Say What You Say	The Eminem Show	2002	[Chorus]	"‘Cause what you say is what you say

Don't leave the restroom with the left foot
Flags of Tibet, to bet, to bed, to death, flesh
Release the leash on a fast car
Feed on the keys, fall asleep in a Jaguar
The tip of thy sword is white
Am I night, am I black, am I light?
Have I been this?
Realize my begin when I find where my end this
Oedipus wrecks, motherfucker this better than sex
Material potion the love of my martyr
Currency soaked in the blood of my father
(Will you cry for me?)
Sky burial, let the wind carry you, farther
Than I could (live forever)
An anatomy, not of me, knotting me to it, nodding me to it
Eyes of the I and others, watching me do it
Adapt in each rubric
Kubrick in plot and tone
Lots of bones, skulls to the top of tone
Skim through it is just skin to it
You're so thin you see the sins through it"

Yo, it's a must, in gats we trust, safeguardin' my life
Ain't no time for hesitation, that only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
Queensbridge and we don't play
I don't got time for your petty-thinkin' mind
Son, I'm bigger than those
Claimin' that you pack heat, but you're scared to hold
And once the smoke clears, you'll be left with one in your dome
Thirteen years in the projects—my mentality is what, kid?
You talk a good one, but you don't want it
Sometimes I wonder, do I deserve to live?
Or am I gonna burn in Hell for all the things I did?
No time to dwell on that, 'cause my brain reacts
Front if you want, kid, lay on your back
I don't fake jax, kid, you know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid, you out of line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition
I'm sippin', E&J got my mind flippin'
I'm buggin', diggin' my ways out of holes by hustlin'
Get that loot, kid, you know my function
'Cause long as I'm alive, I'ma live illegal
And once I get on, I'ma put on all my peoples
React quick, spit lyrics like MACs, I hit your dome up
When I roll up, don't be caught sleepin', 'cause I'm creepin'"

So me and my ace, we got a taste
Of a motherfucker's billy club, he took his gun and
Put it to my head and said, ""Nigga start runnin""
So tell me what's the next episode?
Is he crazy, does he want to chase me or waste me?
I thought, ""Run nigga run"", but I caught myself
Because my secondary thought was death
I've got head and heart real, but still a motherfucker said
""I want another black motherfucker dead
Niggas ain't good for shit to me""
Cause it's a race for second class, so get your ass
Up against the wall bitch, and then he tried
To jump me but the punk became a victim of a walkby
Fuckin with Dre, you get a foot up in your asshole
It's just another way to let you know
Nigga send them, nigga send them, nigga send them
Punk can't fuck with me
Real motherfuckin' G
Straight from the streets of the CPT
Telling you why, real niggas don't die"
The Game	13	Remedy	Doctor’s Advocate	2006	[Verse 3]	"I'm back by popular demand and so
All black interior on the cherry red six-fo'
Niggas endin they careers tryin to shut me up
Actin like I traded in my khakis for a button up
The West Coast still dippin
Game still Bloodin, and Snoop still Crippin
So what you sayin loc? Red and blue bandana
Tied in a knot, as I creep through the chronic smoke
They say it ain't good weed if you don't choke
Shit got my head spinnin like the hundred spokes
Three wheelin through the neighborhood
System on blast, as the motherfuckin one-time pass
The key to drivebys is aim steady
Turn that Bape hoody into motherfuckin confetti
When you cross that enemy line
Close your eyes, parental discretion is advised"

Bullets'd follow 'em and
There's so much coke that you could run the slalom
And cops comb the shit top to bottom
And say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet home
Where personalities clash and chrome meets chrome
The coke prices up and down like it's Wall Street, holmes
But this is worse than the Dow Jones, your brains are now blown
All over that brown Brougham, one slip, you are now gone
Welcome to Hell, where you are welcome to sell
But when them shells come, you better return 'em
All scars, we earn 'em
All cars, we learn 'em like the back of our hand
We watch for cops hoppin' out the back of vans
Wear a G on my chest, I don't need Dapper Dan
This ain't a sewn outfit, holmes, holmes is about it
Was clappin' them flamers before I became famous
For playin' me, y'all shall forever remain nameless"

You can achieve anything that you put your heart into
See the second hand will never stop and neither will the clock

Sayin' some shit to make the bitches wanna suck our dicks
But it's an everyday thang
Communicating to y'all with the Compton slang
Compton's back in the house and your appartment
So open your door, by the way, so we can start it
Test the monitors and call this mic
Cause the way we feel, we're gonna fuck it up tonight
I got my mic in my hand, with a hell of a grip
Bitches screamin' and shit, now it's a trip
Waitin' for the grand finale, or the end
Or stupid rhymes set by Dre and Ren
Well, like a kid, we get new shoes and go faster
Smilin', like hell, as we move past the
Suckers, the motherfuckers with the ego hype
Well we're positive and they're on a negative type

One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull, 'cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', ""Fuck tomorrow!""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage"

But all I eat is fast food
And you know how junk food goes right through ya
So I return *to* the a-rab, then on the way back
I stop- at the liquor store, grab me a six pack
Knowin' that once I'm done with that I'll be back
To get some more
Once I get started I don't wanna stop (ahh...)
And I can't turn around, brew- I can't turn it down
Ironically I turn it up, my liver I burn it up
It's my life I live it up, the cup I gotta give it up
One day
I'm cruisin' down a one-way street
And I done passed *fun* day- three blocks ago
It itself, life is an obstacle
As I maneuver through the manure I try to be responsible
I want a job but I ain't lookin' (how come?)
I ain't tryin' to degrade myself, bein' nobody's Calvin I'm a couch bum
What makes it bad, I had incentive
But that disintegrated to a state that stagnated
I procrastinated
I can't recall a day without bein' intoxicated, or blowed
I'm dealin' with a full deck, at any day I can fold
What makes it bad, I wasn't dealt that bad a hand
And I had a plan
But things didn't go through
The way they were supposed to
Thank God I found you"

Now, whatever possessed me to do the shit that I do to put you in the dirt?
I gives a fuck about a nigga on the streets
I'm runnin' '94, and I done ran '93
Unlike no hurdle, for the murders I committed in my homie fo' convertible
And not a soul saw who did it

If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't *reh tnaw*
Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his momma
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman
I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs
Bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the prenup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby, the only lady that I adore: Hailie
So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted

Up or down, right or left, life or death
I see myself in a mist of smoke

He better lay low

Eric B. & Rakim	14	I Know You Got Soul	Paid in Full	1987	[Verse 2]	"Picture a mic, the stage is empty
A beat like this might tempt me
To pose, show my rings and my fat gold chain
Grab the mic like I'm on Soul Train
But I wait, 'cause I mastered this
Let the others go first, so the brothers don't miss
Eric B. break the sticks (You got it)
Rakim will begin when you make the mix
I'll experiment like a scientist
You wanna rhyme, you gotta sign my list
'Cause I'ma manifest and bless the mic I hold
You want it next? Then you gotta have soul
'Cause if you ain't got it, I'ma make an encore
Take the mic, make the people respond for
The R, 'cause that's the way it'll have to be
If you wanna get on after me
Think about it, wait, erase your rhyme
Forget it and don't waste your time
'Cause I'll be in the crowd, if you ain't controlling it
Drop the mic, you shouldn't be holding it
This is how it should be done
This style is identical to none
Some try to make it sound like this, but you're getting me
So upset that I'm wet 'cause you're sweating me
I drip steam like a microphone fiend
Eager to MC is my theme
I get hype when I hear a drum roll
Rakim is on the mic and you know I got soul"
Kanye West	5	Devil In a New Dress	My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy	2010	[Chorus]	"Put your hands to the constellations

Eminem	15	8 Mile	8 Mile	2002	[Verse 3]	"You gotta live it to feel it; you didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin' this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen, heard, smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible or on the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
Who must I show to bust my flow?
Where must I go? Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket?
‘Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo, my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army, tryna salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryna travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, this city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin', I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo, it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin', no, next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these Free World leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road"
Big Pun	24	I’m Not a Player (Clean Version)	Capital Punishment	1997	[Verse 3]	"Some chick in back of me bought me a daiquiri
Told me meet her in back of Zachary's
'Cause she heard I was packin me
I bagged the freak and hit the tele'
Got the phillies lifted her belly
And put it in your mouth like Akinyele
Far from ugly but they used to say I'm too chubby
But since the money the honies got nuttin' but love for me
So rub my tummy and make a wish, I'll make you rich
Take your kids to the flicks
Come back and fix your favorite dish, not
You craziness, I ain't with that, I'm a hit that
Split back to the shack where my other chicks at
Now can you dig that, I'm the Mack, doin' my thing
Pullin' your strings, makin you feel like you in a dream
It's the king of the Hip-Hop Quotables
Givin you multiples
Just by the tone of my voice in the vocal booth
I notice you doin' your thing with your crew
Is it aight if I come down there and sing to you"
Prodigy	8	There I Go Again	Infamy	2001	[Verse 2]	"Don't make me have to body something
Fuck you and what you known for, to me you're nothin'
I don't see why in the world, to me you frontin'
And if you was that nigga, then you still mean nothing, homes (what)
My gun is bustin'
Fuck all y'all niggas my stomach is touchin'
And I be right there on Myrtle Ave, come through
You bitch ass niggas wouldn't know what to do
I get bulletproof love, pounds and hugs
You get extorted by the thugs that gew up in your hood
You get killed fuckin' with P, you really should
Not do that, I use that Ruger good
Catch a bad one
Ran dunn raggity
You got fucked up and left for dead in the street"
Snoop Dogg	0	Sixx Minutes	Tha Doggfather	1996	[Verse 2]	"I gets my hair whipped on Friday, my day, why they

So what if your head sports a couple of grey hairs?
Same here, and, actually, I think that's funky
(In a Claire Huxtable-type of way)
Miss Lady—it looks to me like you need a little juice in your life
Call me when that big ol' house gets lonely-fied
And I'll teleport from here to there
You show me how it's supposed to be done
I'll make sure you have young fun"

I say, bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe"
Kendrick Lamar	16	FEEL.	DAMN.	2017	[Verse 1]	"I feel like a chip on my shoulders
I feel like I'm losin' my focus
I feel like I'm losin' my patience
I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like—"

I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke

Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room

Big Boi	26	War	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse 2]	"Operation Anaconda; ask yourself
Was it full of bleeps and blunders, did they ever find Osama?
And why in the fuck did Daniel Pearl have to pay the price
For his life and his wife plead twice?
See Al-Amin got life and Fred got dead, Hampton
To dampen the dream of all the Panthers
They got they answer for ransom
As we read together, as we dream together
Count your blessings whenever you feel that things won't be no better
But it got to, you gave me this microphone so I must rock you
Your brainwaves, airwaves, energized and shocked you
Y'all got me, well I got y'all, long as I know y'all listenin'
I'ma always bring food for thought to the table in the kitchen
Now eat, nigga"

The voice in my head say, ""Fuck all these niggas""
Then I start thinkin', 'I should rob all these niggas'
Man, my homies then wan' do whatever I wan' do
I say I wan' eat they say shit we wan' eat too
Let's ride around find a nigga stuntin' on front street
With the shine's on niggas be lookin' like lunch meat

Tell um come up off that shit 'fore we start poppin' some more
Fuck a ski mask, man, niggas know who I is
I got a full clip and niggas know I get biz"
André 3000	27	Elevators (Me & You)	ATLiens	1996	[Verse 1]	"One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hookup
Now, every day, we looked up at the ceiling (Yuh)
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling off instrumentals
Had my pencil, and plus, my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia, headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole-in-the-wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like, ""Freeze!"" We making the crowd move, but we not making no G's, and that's a no-no"

I's in the house like— House like— a joint is lit for my kinfolks
And all the niggas that was down since we been broke
Takin' 'em deeper than a submarine
So scream when you hear the team of two
My crew be thick as two fat hoes sittin' off in a Brougham
I'm packin' my tag backwards if you wanna be actin' wrong
Word is bond like super glue
It's funky like pooper-scoop
And every word I say, you can true"
OutKast	28	Vibrate	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse 1]	"Sometimes when it's late at, when it's late at night

Gang Starr	21	My Advice 2 You	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 2]	"My advice to you, cut down on champagne and booze
For a nigga like me, most time that shit's bad news
It's like lightin a fuse whether it's sneakers or shoes
Cause somebody always wanna step up to start a feud
It's like Set-tin It Off but not the movie
Plus let's get some real women forget floozies and the groupies
Cause they spell mad problems from Watts to Harlem
And the bullshit won't stop long as the world's revolvin
And I recall when niggas knew my pops had clout
But they didn't know my sorry ass was gettin kicked out
And they was seein if I wanted to come bubble with them
And make my ends triple and double with them
And get in trouble with them, now memories of them
I wear em in my heart like a emblem
I doubt we'd ever be bigtime sellin dope coke or dust
It's killin us, let's take our people and make a exodus
Annhilation, inhalation through the lungs
Or extermination, by the use of dirty guns
Triple beam dreams and drug schemes of mad cream
Could be a sad scene when you go to that extreme
""Any man with the plan is precise with his life""
""Think twice""
""My advice is to you..."""
Kendrick Lamar	16	Hood Politics	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 3]	"Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin'
Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike'd be platinum
Y'all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don't ask about no camera blocking at award shows
No, don't ask about my bitch, no, don't ask about my Vogues
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I'm the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
""K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora's box""
I box 'em all in, by a landslide
Nah, homie, we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the Coast involved, then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay

Are you my soulmate? 'Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me, or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take

The Game	13	Let’s Ride	Doctor’s Advocate	2006	[Verse 3]	"Niggas thought I wasn’t coming back, look at me now
Hoppin' out the same Cherry six-fo'
With the motherfucking top down, I'm The Game, nigga
Call your bitch, she ain't home, she with Game, nigga
Remember that Dre, you passed me the torch
I lit the chronic with it, now the world is my ashtray
Ridin' three-wheel motion ‘till the ass scrapes
Turn sunset into a motherfucking drag-race
Now watch it bounce
Hit the switch, let it bounce till the police shut the shit down
(When you hit the club)
Tell 'em you came with me (We gonna twist up)
In the V.I.P
It’s a new day, and if you ever knew Dre
Motherfucker, you would say I was the new Dre
Same Impala, different spokes
Same chronic, just a different smoke"

Eminem	15	Cleanin’ Out My Closet	The Eminem Show	2002	[Verse 3]	"Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)
Well, guess what? I am dead—dead to you as can be!"
Nas	9	Favor for a Favor	I Am...	1999	[Verse 4]	"A killer code, secret untold, how we bury beef with a rose

Beneath us sleep with the Reaper, they sleep eyes closed
That's how real Brad Jordan keep it, to him I owe
Five fo-fo's ready, five masks, five machetes
Attack 'em like Freddy, then we toastin' over spaghetti
I share withcha drama, you share with mine
That's how we killin' two birds at the same time
Send my enemy's ear, I'll send your enemy's finger
With a pinkie ring, that's just a present my nigga
Either way the heat is grave, fuck with 'Face we bring war
Either, you feel these bullets or the Texas chainsaw
Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art
And you my heart, I leave casualties bleedin'
Cause we keep it death for a death, life for a life
Murder for a murder, and I got you it's vice versa"

I cook crack in the microwave, niggas can't fuck with me
Man my co-d's call me Chef Boyar-50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in they weed, shit
Send me them seeds, I'll grow them what they need
Them ain't Chia pet plants in the crib, that's chronic
And I'm selling them for 500 a pop, goddamn it
I sell anything, I'm a hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes, put it in water and tell you it's wine
If you analyze me, what you will find
Is the DNA of a crook and what goes on in my mind
Is contagious, hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or a spot, I'd be that potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me wherever that dope be
Getting money man"

Cut his wife throat as she put her hands to pray
Just five more dogs, then we can get a soccer ball
That's what my commander say
How old? Well I'm like ten, eleven
Been fighting since I was like six or seven
Now I don't know much about where I'm from
But I know I strike fear everywhere I come
Government want me dead so I wear my gun
I really want the rocket launcher but I'm still too young
This candy give me courage not to fear no one
To feel no pain and hear no tongue
So I hear no screams and I shed no tear
If I'm in your dreams then your end is near, yeah"
Daz Dillinger	2	Downtown Assassins	Tha Doggfather	1996	[Interlude]	"Throughout the streets of Long Beach
The streets was infected with drugs, dope peddlers and addicts
Gangs have taken over 75% of our town as the young youth behavior is outrageous with crime
They feel no remorse whatsoever, as the law enforcements have tried to stop the trafficking of drugs from coming into our country, but they can't
The murders have increased more than 95% and the drug amount of which they make is more than 700 million dollars
Now wanted by the IRS and we will convict them of tax evasion"

Nas	9	Represent	Illmatic	1994	[Verse 1]	"Straight up, shit is real
And any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers
We all stare at the out-of-towners
(Ayo, yo, who that?) They better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for
The fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a TEC out the dresser; police got me under pressure"

Guru	20	Peace of Mine	The Ownerz	2003	[Verse]	"At times I feel like my back's against the wall
And if y'all ain't with me, then it's me against y'all
I stand my ground, that's what I was taught
While others stand around, I hold it down like a fort
In the midst of war, I find peace within
Run, lock your doors, don't let the beast get in
The mind is a terrible thing to waste
I show love 'cause it's a terrible thing to hate
Of course I want money, but I won't compromise
Y'all don't realize, think I won't bomb you guys?
With the truth nigga, stop misleadin' the youth nigga
Too many wakes and funerals, that's the proof nigga
Our hood's in danger, kids need guidance
You keep lyin', still the young keep dyin'
As I walk through the valley I fear none, yes I'm the chairman
Here with my nigga Premier son
And we came to change the game
We represent the pain that's real talk, what's y'all claim to fame?
Rappers simply tracin' flows and chasin' hoes
Frontin mad hard, that shit's amazin' yo
Producers makin' Tinkerbell beats for them to rhyme on
They're ass if they get on the same stage that I'm on
Our shit be rugged, like the New York streets
Make the wrong move stupid then you lose your seat
Cats be buyin' up SoundScans to beef up sales
Niggas wanna crossover, wanna be upscale
Fuck that, that ain't hip-hop, that's somethin' else
You're better off back on the ave doin' somethin' else
All you suckers claimin' that you are, thug or gangsta
You disrespect the game by dry-snitchin' you prankster
I thank y'all for makin' more room for us, uhh
Ashes to dust you wonder who's to trust
My sense of self, and my mental health
Is much more powerful, than any hint of wealth
A lot of niggas get cash, and collect Mercedes
But neglect their ladies, and forget their babies
Then the chicks turn and act like dudes
'Cause they reflect our light, so yo act right fool
And this is just a piece of my mind, a thesis of mine
I'mma make moves and I'mma leave you behind
At times I feel like my back's against the wall
And if y'all ain't with me, then it's me against y'all
I stand my ground, that's what I was taught
While others stand around, I hold it down like a fort
In the midst of war, I find peace within
Run, lock your doors, don't let the beast get in
The mind is a terrible thing to waste
I show love 'cause it's a terrible thing to hate

Ain't that true, you can't make a queen out a motherfuckin' hoodrat

And you sleepin' on tha copeasack
What's she do, I gave her the keys to my '74 Cadillac

André 3000	27	Mainstream	ATLiens	1996	[Verse 2]	"They swan diving
As if they name be Gretchen von Ivan
Volkoff rushin' to finish their album then you find them
Lost dog paddling, backstroking, what done happened?
Be rhyming ""catch of the day"" when the recipe calls for ""blackened""
Wrong ingredients
Maybe too much herbs and spices
Maybe you got hungry for the wrong dish
Of them greens and it's enticing how them Jones's sing
So I'm gonna sing just like them to get where they at
I'll even break my by back to touch their rim, if I gotta
My alta mater be that I follow
I bite whatever that's looking tasty, water it down and then swallow
I hope you vomit, won't call no names 'cause that's not my job
It just applies to whom it may concern, you know who you are
But if you don't you never will, you just receive the steel
But then it might get ugly 'cause trust me niggas do feel
The way that I felt when I wrote this, but we must stay in focus
We kings and queens up in this thing, get rid of all them jokers
Face down, face down, face down"
Dr. Dre	1	Talking to My Diary	Compton	2015	[Verse 1]	"I remember when I got started my intention was to win
But a lot of shit changed since then
Some old friends became enemies in the quest of victory
But I made a vow, never let this shit get to me
I let it pass, so I consider that part of my history
And I'm strong; financially, physically
Mentally I'm on a whole 'nother level
And don't forget that I came from the ghetto
Sold a new house for my moms, that's special
I let you going shopping 'til your feet get tired
Then a new Benz just for you to ride in
When I didn't have it, you provided
Don't be surprised that I built an enterprise
And my house got a view of the city like a highrise
I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just talking to my diary"

High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
Shopping sprees, coppin' three
Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah, yes
Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 G's to the crap shooter, niggas can't fade me
Chrome socks beaming
Through my peripheral I see you scheming
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
Niggas is fiending, what's the meaning?
I'm leaning on any nigga intervening
With the sound of my money machining (brrrr)
My cup runneth over with hundreds

Get close enough to smack ya, then clap ya, nigga
Pop tried to front, so I waved the chrome on his ass
Point-blank range, I spazzed, pulled a bone on his ass (Woo)
Two weeks later, niggas came through with MACs to lay me down
They sprayed, I played dead and got the fuck off the ground
Out the blue, I get a phone call, ""50, what up?""
""They sent a bitch at me, I sent the bitch back cut up""
I don't play that pussy shit, I done told you, boy
Front on me, you gon' meet one of my soldiers, boy
Cousin Twin shot up his mama crib, now he in jail
Tripping off flicks of Blu Cantrell, pussy, and black tail

She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper
Bumpin' ""Brenda's Got a Baby"" while a pervert yellin' at her
And she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen
Then seven cars start honking
She start running like Flo-Jo, don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough, don't see a dime of dirty dollars
Just give it all to her daddy, but she don't know her father
That's ironic
See, a block away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothin' really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she makin' ends meet"
Rakim	10	The Mystery (Who Is God?)	The 18th Letter	1997	[Verse 3]	"From unconciousness, to conciousness
By knowledging his wisdom his response is this
A understanding, which is the best part
He picked the third planet where new forms of life would start
He pursued show and prove every move in order
Back to the source he let off his resources in the water
Climb his climax, where the climate is at, high degrees
See he start to breathe deep in the darkest seas
And the plan is, to lay in the clays to form land
And expand, usin the same clays to born man
In his own image our origin begins in the East
Culture rise to breed, with the powers of peace
Deal in equality nature's policy is to be God
Build or destroy positively born life like Allah
And each one was given everlasting perfection
If each one keep living in the same direction
And life was life, and love was love
We went according by the laws of the world above
They showed us physically, we could reach infinity
But mentally, through the century we lost our identity
Life start and ending, we got trife and started sinning
Lost touch with the beginning now ciphers stop spinnin
And what was once easy became confused and hard
Which brings us back, to the mystic question, who is God?
Sixty-six trillion years since his face was shown
When the seventh angel appears, the mystery will be known
Check Revelations and Genesis, St. Luke and John
It even tells us we are Gods in the Holy Qu'ran
Wisdom Strength and Beauty, one of the meanings of God
G.O.D. you and me Gomar Oz Dubar
Knowledge Wisdom Understanding Sun Moon and Star
Man Woman and Child, and so is Allah"

Back with a vocal track that's a fresh one
So now, let's get the motherfuckin' session
Goin', flowin'. It's time to start throwin' - rhymes
So keep in mind all the suckers I'm blowin'
Cause I'ma start showin' the time
Never sayin' I'm the best and just goin' for mine
Unlike a lotta suckers who claim they're gettin' busy
When their records only make good frisbees
You need to quit runnin' off the mouth
Stop and think before you put some whack bullshit out
It's not difficult, in fact it's kinda simple
To create something funky that's original
You either talkin' 'bout the place to be
Who you are, what you got, or about a sucker MC"

Defend infamous to the fullest
Protect my dunns that came with me, they move with me

Aiyo, I'mma terrorize tours and slay shows
Ra say flows, go as far as the Barbados
On the turntables, sound like tornadoes
My topics perform like tropical storms
You're not to get on, the whole spot will get torn
I keep the metropolitan hollerin' and bring the dollars in
Keep the models swallowin', wise as King Solomon
Come slow through the jungle like a animal
Invade any land I go like General Hannibal
From Long Island to Queens, light up the New York scenes
All the way to New Orleans and everything in between
Left to go, bless a show in Mexico
Next thing I know, it's extra cold, I see Eskimos
It's time to rock, get it hot soon as I get in there
Spit in they ear so flows stay froze, and I disappear"
Snoop Dogg	0	Up Jump tha Boogie	Tha Doggfather	1996	[Chorus]	"Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie

And house more hoes than Spelman

Rappers I'm fondlin', they try to settle out of court
But I could never be bought
What type of rebel eats pork?
I'll take the cat and never get caught
U-AC together we fought
'Cause I can't see my mellows boxin' and me not boxin' wit' 'em
I don't care who started it, I'mma be a part of it
Regardless of the odds of how hard
It's been many times we was outnumbered and we still got with 'em
I got rhythm from some boogers and some foxes
But a 5 becomes a 10 when a brother's off some gin
I got juice, and this nigga scared
I'll F your head up, like the LA Four
When I flow like cash I go for broke like Melba Moore
Why should a male with a B.A. get more than me?
When Rashid got an MC degree
And a doctorate in rockin' shit, I go to Dock's to get
A fishwich with cheese
I don't mix with MCs, 'cause I just don't like them mother—
But I'm still maintaining"

Adapt to gat sound and bow down

Articulate, hittin' body parts to start shiftin' shit
Never hesitant, it's the rap game unlimited
Sign my roster, we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminisce twenty years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me, go against the grain, you better hit me
Leggin' me or robbin' me, niggas better body me
‘Cause it's a small world and niggas talkin' like bitches
Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin' you out in pictures
‘Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa-hatin' me
All that bullshit is just makin' me
More the better to concentrate on gettin' cheddar
If shorty set you up, you better dead her
I told you, shape and mold you, son you, then I hold you
Like a pimp, mind control you, double-edge blow you
In the B-I like I'm supposed to, the clique is coastal
International, you local
Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with shit that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
Probably thick, son, I solved 'em
Pulled him in my world and evolved him to chaos

It's slow, lookin' for Rambo
The cop who got grazed back in the days
Chasin' niggas through my project maze
That cop — he got a death wish
He run behind niggas until you breathless
Everyday, he makin' ten arrests, shit!
My nigga, check this, I know the bitch he rest with
I even blessed it, forty-dash-ten, inspect it
(Already checked it, dunn, near his ankle you could see his gun)
Peep, he parked his Jeep in the back of the slum
To check Tanisha, fat ass, real fly with the blonde caesar
Vittadini summer gear, she push the two-seater
I heard she brag about the way he eat her
An Irish man, short, slim with a tan, they say he laced her cheeba
She do be lookin' weaker now, her teeth are foul
Speakin' loud, peep her style, in and out of every reefer cloud
Fat ass dissolvin', like cotton candy in a mouth that's starvin'
Rock the same gear daily, like a soldier in my squadron
I heard she let Jake investigate from her window
'Cause she's a nympho, suckin' dick and coughin' up info
So now it's set up, her and the beast to get wet up
I know he's vest up, we blazin' from the neck up
(Yo, let me knock first) Soon as he open, let your Glock burst
They had the chains on, son, hit the lock first
We busted in, the cop jerked, Jungle popped one in his shirt
I grabbed the bitch by her tits, she tried to say she Earth
We saw the cameras, tape recorders and the monitors
They eyein' us, (Nas, yo, he survived one from the fo'-five)
Pull his shades down, they seen his last days now
There's no way now, we can be treated just like a slave now
Two in the dome, he's laid down, ayo, the bitch is saved now
She's livin' in a snitch grave now"

Add in the paralyzed girl in the wheelchair who just liked to watch
And that was the whole clique
I think about 'em every time I see this old flick
That was taken in the park in front of this old bench
They wrote on the back, ""You thank for 'Push, Kick'
Hope you make a video, the beat is so sick""

Snoop Dogg	0	Get a Light	Tha Blue Carpet Treatment	2006	[Verse 1]	"I need a light, let me step up in this motherfucker 'til I get it right
(Get it right Dogg!)
I need a light, let me lean, make it bright, everythang is dynamite
(Ahhhh true!)
Bust a bitch, tryna feel like a pimp would
It's Snoop D O Double G, I'm in ya neighborhood
I make it crack-a-lack, do it just like that
Take a sip of this, nigga have a puff of that
You had enough of that? Yeah, give it right back
Now lay ya head back and roll in the Cadillac
How we do what we do, what it is, where it's goin' down.. and the
Motherfuckers flip it
Rip it, get specific, and dip it and then they drip it
Cause you know we like to pop it cause you talkin' so different
Fix your Focus and ride, I want the bangers to bang
Or get hyphy with my niggas up north by the Bay
Tryna twist in my whip, I got the big body Benz
Cause I'm rollin with my nephew and we smokin again
""Turn your music down low, man yo' shit too loud!""
What the fuck you talkin 'bout, I put my gun in yo' mouth nigga! (In yo' mouth!)"
Eminem	15	Cum On Everybody	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Verse 3]	"Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
'Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told 'em I was Mike D
They was like, ""Gee, I don't know, he might be""
I told 'em, ""Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert"" (Oh really?)
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster"" (Okay)
Peace out (Bye)
Then I jetted to the weed house, smoked out
'Til I started bustin' freestyles, broke out
Then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect (Brrrt)
""It's Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?""
I want to make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of
So just remember, when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset"
Lil Uzi Vert	31	I Don’t Wanna Break Up	Pluto x Baby Pluto	2020	[Verse 2]	"Sometimes you gotta take a sacrifice
In your love life if you want the riches and the ice, yeah, yeah
(Riches and the ice, yeah, yeah)
Gotta listen to your own advice, yeah, yeah
See, there's love still ahead, you wait, higher than kites (Yeah)
Tip-toeing on a tower of temptation, I ain't scared of heights
And if you fall in love once, you can fall in love twice
I put this girl on ten jets, she used to be scared of flights, alright
Personality be making up for, my height
Met her in New York, she said she from the Heights, alright
She take her time, she ride all night
Made that girl come over, pedal on me like a bike (Bike)
Asian bitch go sucky-sucky, Spanish bitch, she call me papi
On vacay, my bitch in Maui, this ain't even my bitch though
I done bogarted another nigga, this is like a kid though
I done prove myself so many times, like what these hits for?
She ain't know I was a G, she keep asking, ""What that stick for?""
She thought I was making all this money because I was so popular
Rockstar, from the same planet as a pop star
She remind of my account because when I see her, I get rock hard"
2Pac	18	White Man’z World	The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory	1996	[Verse 3]	"So, tell me why you changed to choose a new direction
In the blink of an eye?
My time away just made perfection
Did you think I'd die?
Not gon' cry, why should I care?
Like we holdin' onto lost love that's no longer there
Can you please help me?
God bless me, please keep my seeds healthy
Makin' all my enemies bleed while my G's wealthy
Hopin' they bury me with ammunitions, weed and shells
Just in case they trip in Heaven—ain't no G's in Hell
Sister, sorry for the pain that I caused your heart
I know I'll change if you help me, but don't fall apart
Rest in peace to Latasha, Lil' Yummy, and Kato
Too much for this cold world to take, ended up bein' fatal
Every woman in America, especially black
Bear with me, can't you see that we under attack?
I never meant to cause drama to my sister and mama
Hope we make it to better times, in this white man's world"

(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day, this-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with

I used to never get a call back, homie
Before the money they didn't see me
Like it's dark and it's all black, homie
But now they switching cause the card black, homie
It wasn't always that way, we was recording on the 4-track, homie
New apartment, no fridge, no mattress, no table, no cable
And all I hear is my girl in my ear
And this nigga Eazy asking for his car back, homie
I would've never saw this happening from that far back, homie
What it came to be, would have never believed
Living the life I lived in C-P-T
A motherfucking dream to reality is what you call that, homie
Yeah, it was something to me
No eat, no sleep, wasn't nothing to me
Can't always be how you want it to be
And I'm the one that they looking up to
Fuck they expecting from me?"

Nas	9	Small World	I Am...	1999	[Verse 3]	"I seen death, seen thugs cry, it's bugged why
We let the slugs fly, enter your brain through your skull another thug dies
Pitchin' your soul into that infinite black hole
Where many souls go cause of a .44 blast
Snook was one of ‘em, so many more
Even that Fendi whore got niggas hit up, yeah, let that Henny pour
Carolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich
Heard her bodyguard took Snook to God
Carolyn when she needed him, he took the job
He was close to her ever since she took him inside
When his moms died, dope fiend OD'd, '85
He went crazy, stuck up banks to stay alive
He was live, do niggas even know the things that he tried?
Robbed armored trucks, incidents where police died
He stayed in lower Eastside, peace god (peace god), he stared at me hard
Two of his mans with him, I got to hit 'em
I'm reachin' for my Roscoe, cocked it back on
And get my blast on, at the gas station, bunch of Arabs racin'
Out the way as my Taurus spray
Jump in the whip, hit the highway
You know how I say, the game that I play
It's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies
But can't figure out who's who, keep it true
Shit is cool now, put the tools down? Never
'Cause everyday is on, livin' this life, out for this cheddar"

Nas	9	Take it in Blood	It Was Written	1996	[Verse 3]	"Yo, the time is wastin', I use the mind elevation
Dime sack lacin', court pen pacin'
Individual, lyrical math abrasion
Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation we livin' in
Dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives
A lifestyle on bad streets is patternized
Wise men build and destroy
While the real McCoy dope fiend named Detroit is still dealin' boy
Coke suppliers actin' biased
'Cause rumors say that niggas wear wires and we liars
But every night the gat's fired, and every day a rat's hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani, it's
Just the killer in me, slash drug dealer, MC
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler, demi
Bottles of Mo', yo, simply follow me flow
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow
Rough hoes pull crack out pussies and butt-holes
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it, when you could be about it?
My degrees are routed toward the peasy-haired brick housing
And studded-up, thick medallions
Rich niggas transportin' thousands
Foreign cash exchange amountin' to millions
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped
Watch the cameras in the ceilings
Trick bitches catchin' mad feelings
Peelin' off in a Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheelin'
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch
When we catch them sex niggas with the TEC's you blessed
Word! So now it's on, never wasted a slug
Time is money, when it comes to mine, take it in blood"

Eminem	15	Drips	The Eminem Show	2002	[Verse 2]	"Now I don't wanna hit no woman, but this chick's got it comin'
Someone better get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw her
Off the steps of this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
Though what's she shovin' me for? (Bitch!) Doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?
Man, I'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this whore
What would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce?
She's havin' another baby in a month, and it's yours
And you found out it isn't, 'cause this bitch has been visitin' someone else
And suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips when you get back to Michigan
Now the plot is thickenin' worse
‘Cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse
So you're paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it
Then the doctor comes out, lookin' like Dennis the Menace (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby it's AIDS (Sorry)
He ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it (Sorry)
So you jet back home, 'cause you gon' get that ho
When you see her, you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo
'Cause you love her, you never would expect that blow
Obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleaner's
Bringin' me home diseases, swingin' from Obie's penis
She's so deceivin', shit, this ho's a genius, she G'd us"
Nas	9	Hate Me Now	I Am...	1999	[Verse 3]	"It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights
Hell or the Pearly Gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board, until this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause, my driver, niggas shot up my doors
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me, ambulances were pickin' 'em up
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer, guess it's just the Theory Of Man
Became a monster, atop of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin' – c'mon!"
Sleepy Brown	29	The Way You Move	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Chorus]	"I like the way you move

Nas	9	Street Dreams	It Was Written	1996	[Verse 1]	"My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothin' on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent 'til proven guilty
I'ma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real, G, I'ma fulfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates, got a crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God's sake, what a nigga gotta do to make a half a million
Without the FBI catching feelings? (What, uh)"
The Game	13	Put You on the Game	The Documentary	2005	[Verse 2]	"I ain't got the West on my shoulder, got the West in the backseat
Of the Rover, ridin on dubs, nigga I'm West coastin
The next Hova, from the home of the best doja
Making all that racket, I got the U.S. Open
Stunt on me, I'll leave you wit'cha chest open
Vest broken, hop in the lo-lo with the tec smokin
G-G-G-G-G - I done paid my dues
N.W.A. is back, this is front page news
I got Dre in the back, ridin on 22's
Bitches screamin let me ride, it must be the shoes
Red and black G6's, red dot on the Glock
I'm goin three times platinum dawg, how do I stop? I'm hot"

Nas	9	Where Y’all At	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Verse 1]	"I slow Dance with the Devil, snow setting in the bezzle
Mo' sipping, phantom, bumping Aaron Neville
Polo black scented, eyes squinted
Air Force One's, with my own pattern in it
Fresher than a star, glowing up in the galaxy
Pagan holidays away far from my reality
Fart through Evisu jeans, lethal green
Oliver peoples shades when I creep through Queens
With no AKs, I'm the ambassador
Robin Hood in the Aston Mart
Lot of blood gon' splash in war
Task force homicide, federalies gon' harass
But y'all ain't never seen nothing, not a word not a hint
On the kid from the project bench, that went
Sony-BMG, to that new conglomerate
Island Def Jam, guess how many dollars was spent
To get the best man, y'all niggas ain't silencing shit
Ya bitch been wanna polish the dick, the big Benz
I'ma model ya chick with Zac Posen, cash froze her
Cats stroke her, once I smash it's over
Cold like ice, more chains than slaves
Dangerous ways, Poltergeist change the channel
Roll the dice, I bring change when I gamble
I could sell sand to a Arab, hiding my gun handle"
Eminem	15	Kim	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Verse 2]	"You really fucked me, Kim, you really did a number on me
Never knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then, Kim, I was only eighteen
That was years ago, I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up! Oh God, my brain is racin'
() What are you doing? Change the station
I hate this song! Does this look like a big joke?
There's a **** year old little ****
Laying dead with a slit throat, in your living room
Haha! What, you think I'm kiddin' you?
You loved him, didn't you?
Bullshit, you bitch! Don't fuckin' lie to me
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you, asshole! Yeah, bite me
Kim? Kim! Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly, don't you? No, you think I'm ugly
() Get the fuck away from me! Don't touch me
I hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you
Oh my God, I love you How the fuck could you do this to me?

Big Boi	26	I’ll Call B4 I Cum	Stankonia	2000	[Verse 2]	"I'm a gentleman, I'ma satisfy your soul
And then I'ma get mine
Like Wimbledon we back and forth across the court
Until we give out, do you take it all or spit it out
Are you faking the funk and living a lie
Do you really know what it feels like
To have no control over the G spot?
It's like a brand new pair of Reeboks or a junkie freshly detoxed
You feel the tingling all over like convulsions or the rooster pox
I used to not give a damn
But now I make it a point just to please you
So you can go back and tell all your lil' buddies, I Pretty D'd you"
Nas	9	Project Windows	Nastradamus	1999	[Verse 2]	"Yo, if this piano's the cake, then my words are the candles
Light it up, make a wish, and them angels will grant you
Impatient once tried, but in those angels and bamboo
They lit it up {*puff puff*}, hit it up {*puff*}, now they dismantled
Think the whole world is crazy, got a nine, watch where you walk Two dollar fine, sign of the times here in New York
Hire Satan, United Nations quietly taken, toll on your soul
Take it or leave it, just my evaluation
Stack loot and guns, teach the girls karate, school your sons not to hate
But to stay awake, 'cause the scars a razor make is nothin' in comparison
To the gash left on this whole mass, if we don't get it controlled fast
Might as well be, laughin' with Malcolm X's assassin as we die slow
Perishin', brain dead from a Ericsson
Words are the medicine, two teaspoons for goons
A cup of it for those thuggin' it, y'all sing the tune, uhh"

Nas	9	Shootouts	It Was Written	1996	[Chorus]	"Shootouts is similar to Wild West
Broad daylight, face-to-face without a vest
You know the episodes, thugs camouflage the spectacles
Please God, just save the life that the Devil sold
See, It Was Written, but was never told
Peep the jewels, black man, it's even better than gold
Niggas roll with iron
Police roll in hot pursuit tryin' to stop the loot
Nigga, fuck Jake, cock and shoot"
50 Cent	19	Window Shopper	Get Rich Or Die Tryin’ Music From And Inspired By The Motion Picture	2005	[Verse 2]	"Niggas love me in L.A. as soon as I pop in
They come to scoop me up at LAX and I hop in
Now when it comes to bad bitches you know I got them
Some from Long Beach, some from Watts, some from Compton
You know a nigga wanna see how Cali girls freak off
After that five hour flight from New York
I start spittin' G at a bitch like a pimp, mane
Tell her, ""Meet me at the Mondrian so we can do our thang.""
She can bring the lingerie wit her, I sup-pose
Then we can go from fully dressed to just havin' no clothes
Then she can run and tell her best friend 'bout my sex game
Then her best friend could potentially be next, mane
Listen mane, shit, changed, I came up, I'm doin' my thang
Homie, I'm holdin', holdin', holdin'
Oh shit, mane, the store owner watchin' you
'Fore somethin' get stolen, stolen, stolen"
JAY-Z	6	99 Problems	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 1]	"I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, ""Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward""
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got ninety-nine problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	Lyrics of Fury	Follow the Leader	1988	[Verse 1]	"I'm rated R, this is a warnin', you better void
Poets are paranoid, DJs destroyed
'Cause I came back to attack brothers in spite
Strike like lightnin', it's quite frightenin'
But don't be afraid in the dark, in a park
Not a scream or a cry or a bark, more like a spark
You tremble like an alcoholic, muscles tighten up
What's that? Lighten up, you see a sight, but
Suddenly you feel like you're in a horror flick
You grab your heart, then wish for tomorrow quick
Music's the clue, when I come, you're warned
Apocalypse Now, when I'm done, you're gone
Haven't you ever heard of a MC murderer?
This is the death penalty and I'm servin' a
Death wish, so come on, step to this
Hysterical idea for a lyrical professionist
Friday the 13th, walkin' down Elm Street
You come in my realm, you get beat
This is off limits, so your visions are blurry
All you see is the meters of the volume pumpin' lyrics of fury
It's a—
A furified freestyle"
Daz Dillinger	2	Bang	Doctor’s Advocate	2006	[Verse 2]	"(What's up, little homie? Game, what's up)
We street connected, respected, I gets pathetic
When I did it I must've meant it, so nigga go and rep it
Lil' homies around her constantly on smash mode
Lil' niggas with pistols that blowin' out your asshole
Bang how we give it, the culture that we live in
Fresh out the hospital or fresh out the prison (prison)
Real niggas for life, the roots of the G tree

As this blood flow through my veins
I stand before this mic with a stepped up game
Some things when I look how they never gonna change
It ain't a thing, niggas wild, then I'm cockin' that thing
Cuz you know with every action there's a reaction
And there's no known cure when I'm sick with the clappin'
How many times it have to happen
Niggas talkin' like they generals but just mere captains
The streets there's rules, slugs hit 'em with infractions
And then there's Hollywood if you want some fuckin' acting
You got these niggas out mis-representin' they hood
Give 'em heart now they icin', I'm like nigga what's good?
Cuz you know how I get with these MACs and these techs
Blaze 'em down gives a fuck about the next nigga rep
Play around find yourself getting' cheated by death
Man gone and believe me dog it happened to the best"
Dr. Dre	1	One Less Bitch	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Verse 3]	"Thinkin' about money, and lookin' at a prostitute
The bitch was cute, so now I gotta execute
And shoot game like a real nigga
With a steel trigga
Convince her to move up to somethin' bigga
I think I had a flashback though
'Cause I said ""fuck it""
Loced and choked and spoke to the hoe like this:
""Bitch, it's all about Dre
The money, money, money and that's all I gotta say""
Of course she came with me and remained with me
But the bitch felt lame and ashamed to be
Workin' that trick shit
'Cause niggas knew that she was short one
A little later though she caught one
In the chest and I knew that it was comin'
By who and how the whole act would be done
So what? One less bitch I gotta worry about
But that ain't how it turned out.."

But money's on my mind and I gotta keep the cake up
I don't wanna break up
Tears fall from her eyes and it's messin' up her makeup
Havin' second thoughts, no, we don't have to break up
Small conversation, have sex, then we make up
I don't wanna break up, no, no, no

America target our rap market, as controversy and hate
Harsh realities we in made our music translate
To the coke dealers, the hood rich
And the broke niggas that play
With them gorillas that know killers
That know where you stay
Roll that kush, crack that case, ten bottles of rosé
This was brought to you by Dre
Now every motherfucker in here say:
""Look who's responsible
For taking Compton international
I make 'em holla""
Ooh"
MC Ren	17	Real Niggaz Don’t Die	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Verse 2]	"Real niggas don't die cause they eventually multiply
The niggas I'm with, they take an eye for an eye
Because the times are so wrong, gotta stay so strong
Niggas gotta keep it goin on and on
And don't let no paleface throw your ass in a snail race
Have your residence occupyin a jail space
That's what they want to do cause the system is fucked around
I try to let you know with the records that's underground
They don't give a fuck about a nigga, they would rather pull the trigger
And have you in front of a barrel smilin sayin ""Cheese!""
So nigga get smart and rebel back
I'm not with that black shit so I'm not gonna yell that
All I see is niggas getting harassed
And can't do nothin about it but get a foot in they ass, yo
But if every nigga grabbed a nine
And started shootin motherfuckers it would put 'em in line
And that's how it's supposed to be
When a pussy-ass nigga try to fuck with me
Yo, because it's useless to try
To kill a nigga cause nigga a motherfuckin real nigga don't die!"
Kanye West	5	Big Brother	Graduation	2007	[Chorus]	"My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
If you feel the way I feel why don't you wave your hands?"
Common	22	So Cool	Be	2005	[Verse 2]	"You tryin' to look real sexy
You wanna get some lovers
You know your stomach's too big
For you to be wearing them hip-huggers
You need to work it out, work it off, juke it out
And use yo' mind the way, the way you use your mouth
I'm from where stripper hustlers, with names like Chip and Buster
Come to the crib with that bogus, them boys might Nip & Tuck ya
""Are you a righteous brother?""
Still I might just touch her, build her and destruct her
Got heat, that'll burn like Usher"
Rakim	10	Finest Ones	The Master	1999	[Verse 3]	"Baby, you wake up the next day, lingerie negligee
Give you a sex X-ray before we catch the rays
Let's blaze, a lot more games left to play
While you still amazed from yesterday's escapades
Steadily show my pedigree so thoroughly
To the B-O-N-E, like chemotherapy
Sex and triple X, you ready to wed next
Relax baby, you need plenty of bed rest
You've been a passenger of a high speed crash with a wild style fashioner
Brown skinned ambassador
Chiropractor with a passion
For smashin' your ass like a cardiovascular massacre
You've be through shock heading at your cu-wop
Body so hot, you need a shot from your new doc
With better cures, where's it sore? I'll wet her more
And let it pour from her to head to her pedicures, baby bounce"
Guru	20	Skills	The Ownerz	2002	[Verse 2]	"You little suckers know better, I go head up
If your man left the joint in the whip then tell him go get it
We hold it down like a holy crown
Fools acting like they know me, throw me phoney pounds
Fuck that, I'm sitting back like an aristocrat
Shell shocked chief assassin with a whole fucking list of cats
Thought you was on the case, but you missed the fact
Your bitch talking this and that, I'ma make it simple, jack
I doubled up and tripled that, soldiers, where your pistols at?
Life wrong move lose the gift of that
Why they calling us the most consistent, most significant?
(""Once again"") some old slick shit
Fulfil your need and catch a joyful rush
Enjoy your dutch, haters annoyed with us
Homeboy, it's us, you know, the face from the club
Blazing a dub, with my niggas raising it up, for these..."
Eminem	15	So Far...	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Chorus]	"Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me goin'
This is the inspiration I need
I could never turn my back on a city that made me
And"
Scarface	11	The Diary	The Diary	1994	[Verse]	"I brought my chopper and my hard hat
The shit's fucked up now show a nigga where the war at
'Cause I'm about to clean house
Stick this AK up your ass and blow that fucker clean off
'Cause you niggas in the wrong
You came up short and now we fin to get it going on
I ain't your average motherfucker
You step out of line and watch a motherfucker bust ya
'Cause you done came at me the wrong way
I ain't no Clint Eastwood, nigga, and you done picked the wrong day
So bring your ass to the battleground
Rat-tat-tat-tat, like that is how my gat'll sound
Avoid no niggas 'cause niggas be human
I squeeze the trigger and niggas be movin'
'Cause I don't point it in the air and pull the trigger (Why?)
I'd rather point it at your ass and watch the nigga die
I gives a fuck about your team mates
When it's all said and done you're gonna wish you never seen 'face
You shoulda seen that lil' nigga Brad
Came through here, seen David done that nigga bad
And your homies better stand still
Don't make my brother Warren bust one of you bitches 'cause the man will
Don't bring your ass to my picnic
'Cause I done had it up to here with all you niggas talkin' that bitch shit
So you better get your shit right
I'm from the state where you rarely see a motherfuckin' fist fight
It's all about the gun blast
So you can miss me with that bullshit you spittin' with your punk ass
It's the diary of a born killer
Don't have to worry about me fallin' off this thang cause I'm a strong nigga
The boregard of the hard
With niggas behind me from East Oakland to the South Park
I've got the mind of the man right behind ya
You can run, you can hide but I'll still find ya
Like I say there's no getaway
And I'm gon' have it where your family'll have to throw your shit away
It's the return of the real niggas
I'm prejudiced to a certain extent but still I kill niggas
I'll bust that ass on the fuckin' double
So push on with that ho shit, bitch, 'cause you don't want trouble
So get your ass up off my shoestrings
And let your shermed nigga do things"

I'm from the city where the skinny niggas die
Only birds and Nextels chirp in the sky
And we ride for the letters on our fitted cap
Niggas hit the stash, get a strap and go get it back!
That's for the gangstas, the hustlas, the ballas
From Downtown L.A. to Uptown Harlem

Lupe Fiasco	23	Real	Lupe Fiasco’s Food & Liquor	2006	[Verse 1]	"Lust, sometimes can override trust
She said that's why she gave it up
My man said blood spilled out of everything he touched
He crushed everything, he crushed
Ruined everything he loved, he just wanted the rush
Blamed it on the times being rough
Doing dirt with the devil, chasing after the dust
Make a fuss if it's them, but we hush if it's us"
Lupe Fiasco	23	The Emperor’s Soundtrack	Lupe Fiasco’s Food & Liquor	2006	[Verse 2]	"Roll in it, music bumpin, windows tinted
Through the good neighbourhoods and all of the woes in it
Exerted control in it

Bounce in the booth, spit it like Skoal in it
Putting my heart and my soul in it

The thicks blocks, now every rapper claim he let his clip pop
But even myself tote a gun, and know to run than get shot
I've been there before now I'm fuckin' with Doc

If not, I pitch rocks, anticipatin' my incarceration
Media think I'm fakin' like Mason, but when it comes to mace
Fuck R. Kelly, I don't take it in the face
I find out who sprayed it, and I'm puttin' you under the pavement
No Buddhist priest, Catholic, or Baptist pastor can save him
I'm far from religious, but I got beliefs
So I put canary yellow diamonds in my Jesus piece
I came back from the dead without a part of my chest
Laid in a hospital bed on cardiac arrest
I waited for 3 years while everybody else dropped
Now I understand why Nas did a song with his pops"

Eminem	15	3 a.m.	Relapse	2009	[Verse 3]	"I cut and I slash, slice and gash, last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half-pint of the Jack, my last Vic and-a-half
A flashlight up Kim Kardashian's ass
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December, I think it was, I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin' tub, cut him up into pieces
And just when I went to drink his blood
I thought, ""I oughta drink his bathwater, that oughta be fun""
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me, that might be an artery, son
Your blood-curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 a.m. and here I come, so you should probably run
A secret passageway around here, man, there's got to be one
Oh no, there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants, top of his lungs
But ain't no stopping me from chopping him up-up, 'cause--"
Prodigy	8	I’m Going Out	Murda Muzik	1999	[Verse 1]	"Yo you know the type that style and shit that rise my dick
Pop me a nigga quicker than police
Leave more wombs than a whole room full of chicks
You running while I'm gunning cause you a bitch
I heard niggas talking like they going to dead mines
I got enough guns we can make the headlines
I'm from a place where the realeast niggas get murdered
And the illest niggas try to avoid it
But can't call it
It's a cold world bundle up
Keep your heat on at all times
And never freeze up
And your eyes blink you could catch a hole in your tank
Have you leaking all over the place
Watch how you speak
And watch how you move through the streets
I got a mob with niggas with heat
We liable to squeeze 'fore we think
Breath 'fore is too late
Uph you fucked up and got laid to sleep"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Rigamortis	Section.80	2011	[Verse 2]	"I wrapped him and made him Casper, I capture the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, I'll pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, won't you send us to Bible study faster?
Your hypocritist reaction a blasphemy, I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done, and tell 'em my salary come
In lump sum one hundreds, don't talk to me 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet, and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you'd rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek, and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody deceased
Some persistence, recognize I be
Really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition breaking up the street
Better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention how the far you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitching, getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up, and the catastrophe
Is charged up, and the audacity
Of y'all fucks never could hassle me
And y'all luck just ran out, you'll see"
50 Cent	19	Wanna Get To Know You	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Verse 3]	"Yeah...
Don't know what fucked me up more: watching her lick her lips
Or watching her walk, she hypnotized me with her hips, man
I sweet talk her if she like
'Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right, right?
Look, I'm legit now, I used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefits of world tours (wooo!)
Big house, big Benz – girl, it's yours
Mink coats, Italian shoes, stones with no flaws
You ain't got to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't indulge in my past, fuck what happened before you
'Cause it means somebody's gon' hate you that never saw you
Come here, let me touch on you, I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you, you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you, and you can ride on
We can do it all the night, we can have a baller night"

Nas	9	Halftime	Illmatic	1992	[Verse 2]	"It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
So I react, never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of The Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise ‘cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in '83, I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam, I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch ""CHiPs"", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual of rap
I'm a professional, and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
‘Cause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format?
Explore rap, and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle, I see trial niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas soon, the real rap comes at halftime"
Snoop Dogg	0	Awake	BUSH	2015	[Chorus]	"You're awake
When lightening strikes, you know that you're awake
It definitely starts glowing

It feels so good to know that you're awake
When the G come to the light"
Prodigy	8	Thug Muzik	Murda Muzik	1999	[Verse 4]	"It's Murda Muzik, real life situations, placed on the paper
For all you cats rapping acting like it can't happen
Nigga, we the most infamous
My team glows in the dark, your clique's the dullest
Overconfident niggas get punished
Take a number and get on line for drama
You whiling like you was one of my own
That shit don't mix, we clashing
Make moves, handle your biz
Gun pose, take action, reach for those
Long chrome noses up, my gun blows
Your legs turn noodles, you shot a few going down
I give you that much, you went out
Close but no ci-gar, you must be a fucking retard
Extending your arm in my direction, you better squeeze hard
My rank is that of utmost respect
Y'all niggas only know what you heard on cassette
Manifest words in the flesh
Niggas always see the light after they bleed a few pints
Take your most VP dunn, leave them like the letter T
You won't see me run, unless it's police
Now, take these words home and think it through
'Fore the next rhyme we write might be about you, dunn"

A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got L.A. unified
You better off committin' suicide, teachers ain't testin' us
See, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus
Niggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up
Tax you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dawg, fame is a motherfucker
Do a nigga four favors, when you can't do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif'
How are niggas s'posed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walkin' 'round the crib like, ""Why a nigga can't live?
Get this money, fuck these bitches though?""
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like:
""We can pass these mothafuckin' straps like a physical""
This my city, nigga, everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four-pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit

Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit

Fuck on your ho and she givin' me head
After I'm done, put that lil' bitch to bed, heard what I said?
Order up a shooter and I pull up a sniper
My bro pull up and he shootin' the rifle
We smash out and swerve in the Viper
My jacket made out of tiger (Rawr)
My cars made out carbon fiber (Yeah)
Foreign whip, pull up beside you  (Foreign)
Bitch, we done shot up the opps (The opps)
Them niggas dead on arrival (Baow)"
Big Pun	24	Laughing at You	Yeeeah Baby	2000	[Verse 2]	"Now it's not funny cause I'm hot and got a pot of money
A lot of hunnies around (Don't stop do the brown for me)
My every wish is her command call her bitch she understands
I reminisce how she used to dis me and my man
Check part of the plan she told my son I wasn't the man
I ain't gonna to stop till I got a heart in my hand
I can silence the lamb but couldn't silence her cause
She was as wild as a man with a bottle of liquor
I'm not going to hit her I'm gonna debt her tonight
Double platinum now shes one in the tribe well in the ride now
Well in a fly gettin' high now no more whiteout send the cubans
To provide now it's my world I demand my respect
Give me your girl or get slapped in your neck
Ain't nothin' change im still humble and modest
And im always proud to admit I came straight from the projects

Eric B. & Rakim	14	I Ain’t No Joke	Paid in Full	1987	[Verse 1]	"I ain't no joke, I used to let the mic smoke
Now I slam it when I'm done and make sure it's broke
When I'm gone no one gets on 'cause I won't let
Nobody press up and mess up the scene I set
I like to stand in a crowd and watch the people wonder, damn
But think about it then you'll understand
I'm just an addict, addicted to music
Maybe it's a habit, I gotta use it
Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
I hook a beat up, convert it into hip-hop form
Write a rhyme in graffiti in every show you see me in
Deep concentration 'cause I'm no comedian
Jokers are wild if you wanna be tame
I treat you like a child then you're gonna be named
Another enemy, not even a friend of me
'Cause you'll get fried in the end when you pretend to be
Competing 'cause I just put your mind on pause
And I can beat you when you compare my rhyme with yours
I wake you up, and as I stare in your face, you seem stunned
Remember me? The one you got your idea from?
But soon you start to suffer, the tune'll get rougher
When you start to stutter, that's when you had enough of
Biting it'll make you choke, you can't provoke
You can't cope, you should've broke because I ain't no joke"
50 Cent	19	Best Friend	Get Rich Or Die Tryin’ Music From And Inspired By The Motion Picture	2005	[Chorus]	"If I was your best friend

Now girl, let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha ha)
He say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend
I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)
Girl, I'll be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine (Girl, promise you'll be mine)

Quick to put one in ya first
Before they search your pockets get that china
And where they got ya that's where they gon' find ya
They rollin' out there nigga, that's that real shit
Where bein' slick can get you caught up real quick
Hold up homie, don't let this money blind ya
Cause you won't see me standin' right behind ya
Then it's time's up, that's how we talkin' if he come from the Beach
Better watch them niggas out here if they come from the East
Don't stop if I'm not out somewhere so niggas can see
Cause they don't give a fuck, you stuck if you ain't with me
My city's a beast..
You can't walk through the Beach unless you walk with a piece
You can't talk to police cause most police is like me
They get that cheddar like they want it, take yo' shit in the street"
Eminem	15	I Will	Music to Be Murdered By	2020	[Chorus]	"I thought I heard a voice in my head that said ""Kill""
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will"""

Rakim	10	Put Your Hands Together	Follow the Leader	1988	[Verse 3]	"Now, who's the man with the master plan?
With stacks of verbal attacks? So clap your hands
Rhyme written in graffiti, xeroxed on blueprints
Students influenced are now a nuisance
You couldn't fight it, you had to clap to this
You got excited, you almost snapped your wrist
The rhymes was written for the crowd's enjoyment
When I'm with this, you can't toy with
The Def Jam juicer, rough rhyme producer
Loads of lyrics get you loose then looser
The man so smooth and world so rough
Eric is throwin' and sewin', rippin', restitchin' the cuts
Microphone, Your Majesty, no one's bad as me
Seems the tragedy, Rakim had to be
Thinkin' of some def view of a video
Visions are vicious and I'll let the city know
Whoever's frontin', they know, nothin' to say though
So lay low, musical forms are kickin' like Kato
Don't get near it, hard as you ever hear it
I know it's fearified, but don't fear it
And try to predict which rhyme you can kick
You're quick to pick your best 'fore the mic is lit
Instead of goin' with the flow like you're supposed to go
And enjoy the show and, yo, put your hands together"
JAY-Z	6	December 4th	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 2]	"Now, all the teachers couldn't reach me
And my momma couldn't beat me
Hard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein' me
So, with that disdain in my membrane
Got on my pimp game; fuck the world, my defense came
Then DeHaven introduced me to the game
Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine, I'm a hustler now
My gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd
And all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now
My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag
Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged
Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had
Supposedly, knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack-ass
I'm gettin' ahead of myself; by the way, I could rap
But that came second to me movin' this crack
""Gimme a second, I swear,"" I would say about my rap career
'Til '96 came, niggas, I'm here; goodbye!"
Nas	9	We Will Survive	I Am...	1999	[Verse 2]	"(Thug Life never die..)
Dear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop
And use teeth to bite off beer tops and Pour Out A Lil' Liquor
You was more than just the wildest nigga
2Pacalypse, I understand your style, nigga
It's goin on the third year, since you've been gone
On the East and West Coast the same shit is goin on
The industry be talkin', offendin' me often
They don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin
I can relate, shootouts and court dates
All eyez on you, niggas in your face invadin' your space
You asked if I could trade in your place, how would I hold up?
How long would I ride before I fold up?
How did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go?
You predicted it in every line, all in your flow
There could never be peace I have to quote
Can't believe I heard my name on ""the realest shit you ever wrote""
We had words 'cause the best supposed to clash at the top
But kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and stopped
In NYC, at MTV, people watched
We was both deep, after you left, I got no sleep
Think about how us real niggas would be
If we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it?
You was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified
Like the son of God, when Lucifer lied
And make the world think, young blacks should be extinct?
But Thug Life'll never die, we stay high and just link
Will there ever be another MC as nice?
Will you return to us like the resurrection of Christ?"

Came from nothin', you can't feel what I’m sayin’ (Came up)
Hundred shots, I gotta stick to the plan (One hundred)
Sloppy toppy gotta get it again
Shorty boppin', she just pushin’ the brand
Solo, but the hitters pullin' up on demand
Chauffer with the Phantom, I'm like Stunna when I land
I ain't never sober, I got pills and I’m sharin'
Cop a new hammer with the cooler, it don't jam
Took the show on the road gettin' bands on bands

Record companies act like pimps
Getting paid off what we made when we the ones that's fly like blimps
But ain't no Goodyear, I tell it like it is so I'm like look here
Just willing to get what I deserve, my kids do have a mother
And a little house, with a dog in the backyard going ""woof-woof""
Who knows what I must face when I leave this recording booth?
Poof, back in the real world where birds fly
From Miami by way of Cuba to whoever wants to get that high
There's clouds of clowns, seas of G's
Pro-jects, packed with playas meditating on their knees
Just to make them ends meet, like ground beef, you won't believe
The shit that niggas attempt 'cause they got other mouths to feed
Besides they own"
Kendrick Lamar	16	How Much a Dollar Cost	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 1]	"How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin' my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I'm chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
""20 on pump 6,"" dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
Twenty years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend him a ear or two
How to stack these residuals tenfold
The liberal concept of what men'll do
""20 on 6,"" he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was leery
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
Asked me for ten Rand, stressin' about dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it
Told him, ""Beat it""
Contributin' money just for his pipe—I couldn't see it
He said, ""My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothin' less, nothin' more""
I told him I ain't have it and closed my door
Tell me, how much a dollar cost?"

High blowin bottle after bottle of that dro
Slidin on the road, groupie in my vehicle that I don't even know
And If I wasn't Banks shorty probably wouldn't roll
From the Benz to the lobby from the lobby to the do'
If you ain't with the program ma you gotta go"
Eminem	15	I’m Shady	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Verse 1]	"Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough? (Huh?)
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl? (I did)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes, and still screamed ""Fuck the world""
(I'm Slim Shady) So come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me 25 times in the same spot (Ow)
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot
Stop they blood flow 'til they veins clot
I need a pain shot and a shot of plain Scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make 'em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Hello/Goodbye (Uncool)	Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool	2007	[Verse 2]	"He just sits, and waits for them to kick in the door
He once was a hero, they don't love him no more
There's a blast, every time a ten hit's the floor
His gift, for not fighting another man's war
And if they can get their hands on the mask
That he had wore on his face
They can put somebody else in his place, to restore
The state, the illusion that it's safe
The faith, that being a slave is so great
As gas fills the room and rockets destroy everything around him
He stands to find himself surrounded
By thousands of soldiers that he once trained
To never miss their targets, heartless"
Eminem	15	Rock Bottom	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Verse 2]	"My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hopin' things look up, but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of bein' hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game, play
'Cause when we die, we know we all goin' the same way
'Cause it's cool to be the player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
Or comfortable and roomy in a 6
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick, it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball, but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away"

Got my gold watch and my gold chain
With my fancy car and my diamond ring
With my ghetto broad and she's so plain
Got a couple scars and one of those long names
She-a fight a nigga and cusses with no shame
And her ex-man had her baggin' up cocaine, but she
Yeah, yeah, she love it over here, it's just

A nigga like me hold TEC's, are you the same too?
Goin' through the emotions of gun holdin'
Long shotgun's down my pants leg, limpin'
Killa B, you still livin'
Even my pops too, he taught me how to shoot when I was seven
I used to bust shots crazy
I couldn't even look because the loud sound used to scare me
I love my pops for that, I love my nigga D-Black
I'll take the life of anybody tryin' to change what's left
And through all of that, a nigga ain't scared of death
All y'all brand new niggas just scared to death
I spent too many nights sniffin' coke, gettin' right
Wastin' my life, now I'm tryin' to make things right
Grand open some gates, invest in the rag business
Do things for the kids, the little thuns
Build a jungle gym behind the crib, so they can enjoy youth
CBR's and VCR's, ATV's and big screen TV's
Nigga, please, don't make me have to risk my freedom
We worked our whole life for this, you get your shit beat in"

Cute, your shorty watch Barney's, we head to Barneys
End up at Marni, Giorgio, service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini, the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year, last year was magic: 32
Lyrically, can’t none of y’all murder Ye
'Cause y’all raps ain’t got no vertebrae
I got style, ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate
First of all, we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majesty’s swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin' board when I am bored
All my homies GDs, but I am Lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Here’s somethin' that you could use as an analogy
My life is like a child’s: illusions become reality"

Thinkin' you fresh, suggestin' beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
The time we committed love, it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you
But as my equal, it's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you

I creep in the cold 'till my nose get runny
Then I'm layin' for a nigga like I'm waitin' on money
I ask these hoes what the fuck they want from me
From the gate I keep it real that's why they gon' love me
I got a shorty if she get down for me, when I'm out of town
You know she holdin' down the crown for me
Dog, god forbid if i die, don't worry kid
Take you with me shit pussy don't want me
My life's story was the Henny, had to stop that
And now I'm focusin' clear when I cop that
Fuck gettin' clapped, it be more like applause
Since they tellin' like broads, might as well get 'em all
The H-, the A- the V- the O- the C
I'm the man, the myth pushin' shit to the White League"
Kendrick Lamar	16	United in Grief	Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers	2022	[Chorus]	"The new Mercedes whip, black G-Wagon
The, ""Where you from?"" It was all for rap
I was 28 years young, twenty mill' in tax
Bought a couple of mansions, just for practice
Five hundred in jewelry, chain was magic
Never had it in public, late reaction
50K to cousins, post a caption
Pray none of my enemies hold me captive"
2Pac	18	Young Niggaz	Me Against The World	1995	[Bridge]	"I'm tellin' you, to be young
Have your brains and have every limb and all that

Snoop Dogg	0	Snoopafella	No Limit Top Dogg	1999	[Verse 2]	"Well I shrugged, I hissed, they all tried to diss
And I'd get them back if I had one wish
Before I could make my thought a phrase
There appeared a man from a puff of haze
He said, ""What's up, Dogg? My name is Herb
I'm your fairy Doggfather, you know it, word!
Now I've came here with the main purpose
Of granting you your fondest wish""
I said, ""Herb, my man, just make me fresh
And I'm sure that I can handle, all the rest""
With a snap of his fingers sparks began to shoot
And I was jumpin in my body: a slick silk suit
On my feet was some white tube socks
And a fresh pair of Chucks from the Foot-lock
I showed him my sack, and don't you know
With a snap, the sack became some doe-doe
Once again his hands began to flow
Then he changed my skateboard into a six-fo' (damn!)
He checked me over, passed me the keys
And said, ""One more thing before you leave...
You must return before the stroke of twelve
Or you'll turn back into your old self"""
André 3000	27	Elevators {ONP 86 Mix}	ATLiens	1996	[Verse 4]	"Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way (Hey)

Talkin bout smoke some ""Hey man, you remember me from school?""
Naw not really but he kept smilin like a clown
Facial expression lookin silly
And he kept askin me, what kind of car you drive, I know you paid
I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes from all them songs that y'all done made
And I replied that I had been goin through the same thing that he had
True I got more fans than the average man but not enough loot to last me
To the end of the week, I live by the beat like you live check to check (Uh)
If you don't move yo' feet then I don't eat, so we like neck to neck (Uh)
Yes we done come a long way like them slim ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon stop so we just gonna continue (Uh)"

I'm talking Malcolm, Coltrane, my man Yusef
Through death grew conception, new breath and resurrection
For moms, new steps in a direction
In the right way, told her, ""Inside is where the fight lay
And everything a nigga do may not be what he might say""
Chicago nights, they stay on the mind
But I write many lives, they lay on these lines
Wavin' signs of the times, many say the grind's on the mind
Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wanna rhyme
Bush pushing lies, killers immortalized
We got arms but won't reach for the skies
Waiting for the Lord to rise, I look into my daughter's eyes
And realize I'ma learn through her
The Messiah might even return through her
If I'ma do it, I gotta change the world through her
Furs and a Benz, Gramps wantin 'em
Demons and old friends, Pops, they hauntin' him
The chosen one from the land of the frozen sun
Where drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones
Walk like warriors, we were never told to run
Explored the world to return to where my soul begun
Never looking back, or too far in front of me
The present is a gift, and I just wanna be (Be, be, be, be)"

Cappin' 'em, kept in my Benz, hot beginnin' to end
Watch the 22's spin, my hoes they perfect ten
I got shot up but I got up and I'm back at it again
Motherfuckers that thought I wouldn't win pretend to be friends
At first you fail, try, try, try, try again
I'm the best, don't you get it? Forget it, when I spit it, it's crazy
You love it, admit it, you like that I live it, it's Shady
Aftermath in yo' ass, bitch
If it's not a classic, when it's done we trash it
Flow I got it mastered, stunt and get yo' ass kicked, bastard

You ask me, they wasn't even supposed to make it
In the rap biz, they don't know what rap is
So give it up, become a actor or a actress
Or a producer, 'cause you fail to use the
Mic right, so take flight 'fore I bruise ya
For sayin' those bull crap wack raps on wax
You need to get smacked, sit back and rip that contract
A-yo, I'm serious! Big L ain't playin' games
I should get foul and buckwild, and start sayin' names
But deep down inside, you know who you are
Your rhymes are not up to par, you fake superstar
And that really gets on my nerve
When a rapper gets the credit that he don't deserve
Goin' platinum, and don't have no soul
Some rappers are mad nice, and don't even go gold
I don't like the way it's goin' down
Because it should be the other way around"

Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one 'cause they think this shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Haha)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it 'cause we consider these minutes golden

Then piss in the cup, call the shit Hpnotiq (Brrrrat!)
I bleed Compton, spit crack and shit chronic
And you new niggas ain't shit but new niggas
Bathing Ape-shoe niggas, I'm talking to you, niggas

Sell another five million albums? Yes, I am

Gangsta rap is where I live just knock on the front door
Niggas stunt more than Jackie Chan, what the fuck them faggots saying?
Nothing when I walk in the club with the gat in hand
Take 'em back to '94, shooting out a Astro van
Banging was the blueprint, money was the master plan
Duffel bag full of Grants and Franklins
Rob niggas, take they money, shoot straight to the bank then
Head to the barbershop to get chopped up
Hearing war stories who dead and who locked up
Who snitching, who pitching and who knocked up
Fuck niggas in Black Wall Street I trust
Black hoodies and black Asics standing on the pavement
Hustlers don't sleep nigga we work the grave shift
Fuck that long money, nigga, get paid quick

Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'ing, heard about them old timers OD'ing
Young, early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordans and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny? Getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase, I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel, stressing to pull out of the heat, no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending, never holding out

People warned me: ""When you on top, there's envy""
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood, but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the street, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that – what you expect, hoe?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, 'cause niggas feel this, right?"

Put me in a line, put the knives to me
Put me in the sky, put it to my side
Then push it inside of me
Holy mother of the blessed soul
They don't love you there, they love you here
I love you like I'm Mexico, say yeah
Santa Maria, Madre de Dios, ruega por nosotros pecadores
Ahora y en la hora de nuestra muerte, amen"
Scarface	11	I Seen a Man Die	The Diary	1994	[Verse 3]	"I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong
But you kinda scared of dyin' so you hold on
And you keep on blackin' out and your pulse is low
Stop tryin' to fight the reaper, just relax and let it go
Because there's no way you can fight it though you'll still try
And you can try it 'til you fight it but you'll still die
Your spirits leave your body and your mind clears
The rigor mortis starts to set, now you outta here
You start your journey into outer space
You see yourself in the light but you're still feelin' outta place
So you standin' in the tunnel of eternal life
And you see the ones you never learned to love in life
Make the choice, let it go if you can back it up
If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up
But if you ready, close your eyes and we can set it free
Here lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace"
Havoc	7	Spread Love	Murda Muzik	1999	[Verse 2]	"Two in the neck, yes you will, if you not feelin me yet
Outta respect can't stand it man, you niggas is set
Sweatin' hard ain't do shit but run your list
When a nigga get confronted all he do is take the fifth
Not the law, I'm talkin' about the four, niggas is raw
You ain't know, now you know leakin' down on the floor
Never renege with my words, believe what you heard
Never flash a gat and go bust it, that shit is absurd
Cause I be right back to my brother say word
You got to drive, no doubt, I cock it bein tougher for herbs
Cause the plot is power and I do it for hours
Won't save me for a minute 'til I move on you cowards
Direct, drama to us, Infamous be the ones and we rowdy
Million dollar ballad, make an album, get classes"

Big Boi	26	Jazzy Belle	ATLiens	1996	[Verse 4]	"Having no mercy for the disrespectful ones, some
Be hanging around the crew looking for funds, dumb
Deaf and fine, they be asking me all about mine

Now you got me on the phone, straight talkin' to the cops
Tryna verify your government, they got you now, they lovin' it
They wanna hang that ass, couldn't get you in the past
Though I can't say your prime, you was still young at the time
Did a lot of older things, you was ahead of your time
Never told you to slow down, Residual Crown Heights was wild
All I could say was be careful, give you a dap then bounce
Shit that you went through, watched the drama amount
Gave a fuck long as you wasn't part of the body count
Now I feel guilty, half the blame for your incarceration
Should've intervened when you first started catching cases
Fuck it, it's done, now you in there
Gotta hold it down, you your mother's only son
And I'ma ride for you, baby, cause you locked and it's still love
I'm still there, when you get home, I'mma be there"

Lupe Fiasco	23	Paris, Tokyo	Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool	2007	[Verse 2]	"So let's keep it real, all in together, ""Free Chill""
Tell the stewardess to throw a movie on the reel
Heat up my kosher meal, exchange my dollar bills
Lean back in my first class seat and sleep
Don't wake me 'til I land
Where they barely understand what I speak
But they nod to my beats
I tell my fans who I am and they stand
And they clap, they applaud, they love me, my God
Otsukaresama deshita, or maybe au revoir
A spree on Saint-Honoré, then back to Charles de Gaulle
So I can get home and tell her everywhere that I been, and
Everything that I done, and
Tell her that she's the one, and, umm"
Kurupt	4	Doggy Dogg World	Doggystyle	1993	[Verse 2]	"Well, if you give me ten bitches, then I'll fuck all ten
See my homie Snoop Dogg sippin' juice and gin

Styles vary, packin' flavor like Lifesavers
Ain't that somethin'? Talk shit and I'm dumpin'
I had your whole fuckin' block bumpin'
Don't sweat, but check the technique, I'm unique like China
You'll never find a bomber rhymer than this nigga behind ya
So peek-a-boo, clear the way, I'm comin' through
One-two, three — you can't see me
I'm a G like that, strapped with hit-hard tactics
A fuckin' menace, usin' hoes like tennis rackets
It's on again, it's on and poppin'
All I see is green, so there ain't no stoppin'
I wanna see some panties droppin'
I'm comin' from L.A, she used to chill with Dre up in Compton
(All I ever did was just use that ho
Show her my dickies, get with these, and kick flows)
I’m dishin' out blues, I’m upsettin' like bad news
Cut off khakis, french braids, and house shoes
Kurupt, the name’s often marked for catchin' slugs
And I smoke weed for the fuck of it
Rough and rugged shit, it’s unexplanatory how I gets wicked
But it’s mandatory that I kick it
Check it, I’m runnin' hoes in '94, now must I prove it
Hoes call me Sugar Ray for the way I be stickin' and movin'
Prepare for a war, it’s on
I’m head huntin', hit the button, and light shit up like Red Dawn
Peep the massacre from a verbal assassin
Murderin' with rhymes packin' TEC-9’s for some action
You really don’t know, do you? You fuckin' wit a hog
You can’t do me, I’m goin' out looney like O-Dog"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst	good kid, m.A.A.d city	2012	[Chorus]	"Promise that you will sing about me

Nas	9	Hope - Acapella Version	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Outro]	" Ain't got nothing to do with Old School
 New School, Dirty South
 West Coast, East Coast, this about us
 This our thing, you know what I'm saying
 This came from the gut, from the blood
 From the soul, right here, man
 This is our thing, man
 You know? so I say what I say
 And I say what I say, and I mean it
 Y'all take it how you want to take it
 Because if you asking: ""Why is Hip Hop dead?""
 It's a pretty good chance, you the reason it died, man
 It's a pretty good, chance your lame ass, corny ass
 Is the reason it died, man
 You don't give a fuck about it, you don't know nothing about it
 You want this paper, be a hustler
 You a hustler, you ain't a rapper, get your paper man
 You know what I'm saying, but this rap shit is real
 Bitch, this shit is real: bitch

Gang Starr	21	Mass Appeal	Hard to Earn	1994	[Verse 1]	"No way, you'll never make it
Come with the weak shit, I'll break it
Step into my zone, mad rhymes will stifle ya
Lines like rifles go blast when I kick some ass
A lot of rappers be like one-time wonders
Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under their noses
I hate those motherfuckin' posers
But I'm so real, to them, it's scary
And with my unique skills, nah, you can't compare me
And no, we don't make wack tracks
And all the suckers get pushed back when I'm kickin' real facts
I represent, set up shit like a tent, boy
You're paranoid 'cause you're a son like Elroy
And you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal
Maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal"
Eminem	15	Drug Ballad	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Chorus]	"‘Cause every time I go to try to leave
Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me
‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em ""no""
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me"

You should join us in the middle of the mall
I'm cool, man, I've got a watch already
Well, excuse me"
50 Cent	19	I Smell Pussy	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Chorus]	"Girl you know I like it when you climb on top
Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to ecstasy without taking ecstasy
Girl you know I like it when you climb on top

And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to ecstasy without taking ecstasy"
Common	22	The Corner	Be	2005	[Verse 2]	"Street lights and deep nights, cats tryin' to eat right
Ridin' no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can keep sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
It's hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game at its peak, we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets, hats cocked left or deep right
It's steep life, coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three stripes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong 'cause it's hard to see right
Look to the sky, hopin' it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner"
Eminem	15	Stronger Than I Was	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Chorus]	"But you won't break me
You'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'ma still be humble when I scream ""Fuck you!""
‘Cause I'm stronger than I was"
Gang Starr	21	Robbin Hood Theory	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 3]	"God is Universal, he is the Ruler Universal
For those who can't follow that spells GURU when in my circle
I see all sides of my culture...
Design my thoughts like a sculpture
And chumps they wanna get with me cause I'm another entity
I'm sent to be, leadin the army of the century
Mention me, and snakes will retreat, eventually...
... due to my Robin Hood Theory"
Kendrick Lamar	16	The Heart Part 5	Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers	2022	[Verse 2]	"I said I do this for my culture
To let y'all know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof Rover
In my mama's sofa was a doo-doo popper
Hair trigger, walk up closer, ain't no Photoshoppin'
Friends bipolar, grab you by your pockets
No option if you froze up, always play the offense
Niggas goin' to work and sellin' work, late for work
Workin' late, prayin' for work, but he on paperwork
That's the culture, point the finger, promote ya
Remote location, witness protection, they gon' hold ya
The streets got me fucked up, y'all can miss me
I wanna represent for us
New revolution was up and movin'
I'm in Argentina wiping my tears, full of confusion
Water in between us, another peer's been executed
History repeats again
Make amends, then find a nigga with the same skin to do it
But that's the culture, crack a bottle
Hard to deal with the pain when you're sober
By tomorrow, we forget the remains, we start over
That's the problem
Our foundation was trained to accept whatever follows
Dehumanized, insensitive
Scrutinize the way we live for you and I
Enemies shook my hand, I can promise I'll meet you
In the land where no equal is your equal
Never say I ain't told ya, nah
In the land where hurt people hurt more people
Fuck callin' it culture"

We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling

With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment"

Rakim	10	The Saga Begins	The 18th Letter	1997	[Verse 1]	"The saga begins, my eyes is the photography lens
Properly pushed pens to show quality gems
The horrors be grim, but yo, maybe tomorrow we win
If we follow the trends and keep count of the dollars we spend
I want a mahogany Benz, I want lottery ends
I want property, friends, plus my hobby is skins
If I get sloppy and sin, then my prophecy ends
But the God'll begin, watching my odyssey spin
In the place where war be, based on a true story
Territory was made for me to pursue glory
Blast alone masses in zones have to be sewn
Every capacity blown, I'm internationally known, yo"

She say, ""Can you get my friends in the club?""
I say, ""Can you get my Benz in the club?""
If not, treat your friends like my Benz
Park they ass outside 'til the evenin' end
When I go raw, I like to leave it in
When I wake up, I like to go again
When I go to work, she gotta call it in
She can't go to work, same clothes again
And her heart colder than the souls of men
Louboutin on the toes again
Tight dress dancin' close to him
Yeezus just rose again"

Daz Dillinger	2	Do What I Feel	Dogg Food	1995	[Verse 2]	"Now, imagine yourself in a bottomless pit
Wit' no way your climbin' out, and this ain't the punishment
Deadly as crystal crack, how should I react?
Wit' intentions to keep on mashin', strap for strap
Is this my boundary from county to county?
Your homies wanna try to soak me like Bounty?
Dogg Pound Gangsta all day, all night
Partyin' like a muthafucka now all night
For the simple fact I been wantin' to serve yo' whole fuckin' crew
Now, whatchu wanna do? (Whatchu wanna do, nigga?)
Hold up your weapon, slowly steppin'
Caught your homie straight slippin'
You shoulda known from the jump, nigga, that I was trippin'
I gets to bustin'! (Blaow-blaow!)
You get to duckin'! (Blaow-blaow!)
Dogg Pound Gangsta gets to dippin' in da cut!
My performance is enormous, the way that I stayed upon 'em
I catch 'em and let 'em have it, wassup wit' my opponents?
I hold it down for the two-one, I'll be gunned down by no one
Forever I reign — top Dogg number one!
My rhymes is self-explainable, a Dogg that's untrainable
Uncontainable, my mind state's so strainable, huh!"

Common	22	Invocation	One Day It’ll All Make Sense	1997	[Verse]	"Envisioning the hereafter, listening to Steve Wonder
On a quest for love like the ""Proceed"" drummer
I strike like lightning and don't need thunder
Inhale imagination and breathe wonder
That's your lady, I used to run up in her and chief weed from her
It's a cold world and niggas need summer
At times, my going forward seems like retreat
As I rewrite rhyme after rhyme and throw away beats
Growing into my britches, outgrowing the streets
There's a thin line between war and peace, whores and Jeeps
Ignore MCs like beeps, scribbling freedom on pages
My third eye is like pink eye, seeming contagious
Redeeming the ancients with ageless rhyme jargon
I feel Mexican, hip-hop is my garden
Don't give a fuck where you charting, certain shit I can't honor
It ain't that you selling, it's your karma
Rappers I monitor like a chaperone, you large and haven't grown
Poetically perform live-bys, another rapper gone
The stage becomes a catacomb, I rap like a mummy
Not for the money, I could've sampled Diana Ross a long time ago
My mind of flow is like motor key twenty
Young blood said he had dimes, I prayed that he see twenty
Hollering at the brothers, either you gon' be a thug or a man
Flip drugs and get land
I can see my man was tired as he described how the bucks hit him
And said slugs was still stuck in him
When it rained, it fucked with him
This bucket interrupt wisdom and asked when my album was coming
I said it's here"

Lupe Fiasco	23	Mural	Tetsuo & Youth	2015	[Verse 2]	"Then forge poetry, like a young ornery Morrissey
Then spit it to the golden locks thots, who like their porridge all watery
Not scorching nor sorbet-y
From the steel orbitings, sorcerer of sorcery
Coming down gorgeously, just like a Stacey Dash waterfall
Or more torturing, a water-boarding Barbie doll
A river of women like Brazilian Carnival
Swimming in feminine bikinis made out of Barbasol
Somebody give them the volleyballs
If you love her, don't ever send her to Mally Mall's
Homie, if she lonely she might end up in Macauly's claws
Coming out the closet over goblets, down at Mardi Gras
The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call
My rap position was black condition and activism
Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems
But they not apt to listen, unless it's dropping on Activision
Are we apps, or are we bodies filled with apparitions?
Operating applications, stuck inside of Apple prison
Chicken hackin’ download updates that lack religion
Or are we more...
...Than soil tainting, disloyal changelings
Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing, and foiling other's royal saintings?
I sit back and watch the world through eye holes in my oil paintings
Uhhh! Ain't nothin' to it, but to do it
Unless you Virgin Mary, nothin' do it but the truest
Believe all that, unless you Jewish
Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus
And I feel like a missionary, to a clitoris
The water bearer, heir of traditions, that I swear to never change
My chair position or conditions of my porridge
Submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves out the mothafuckin' forest
As I perform a nerd storm, I prefer my pictures in word form
Bury the hatchet like how a bird born
As I paint cold pictures, like Kool-Aid facing condensation
Having conversations with flavorful combinations
Slave to my concentration
So that's OJ da Juiceman, meets OJ with two hands
And two gloves, that's too snug, to judge who was, who drew blood
And, Lupe look at all these toucans, in a cemetery full of tomahawks
Giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults
Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across
Anomalies by the colony, flukes by the reservoir
Wildin' pursuers end up as poofs, on the desert floor
Levitating youths, who know the truth of where the fountain hides
Buckaroo roof painting tunnels onto the mountain sides
A thousand parts, a pound of heart, an ounce of eyes
Announcing now, the doubt in mouth, pronounces out a count of lies
Chocula Counts by the count of five
Refrigerator roof, full of animals and monsters
Incinerator chutes and the manual for Contra
Assorted memories from my childhood
Absorbing energy from the wild woods
Electronic combat Konami sign contract
Chinese chalk killing cucarachas on contact
Chicago, spray gun aficionado
Efficient spitting bridging divisions isn't Chicano
Who’s the Boss? If it isn't Alyssa Milano
Dudikoff, ninja mission into the Congo
Polarize envy of the older guys
Black obi, shinobi hittin' Kenno in the face with all my throwin' knives
Sub-zero, Gaiden, hiding, Raiden in the pack as well
Sound village, Leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells
Dodging Rain and catching hail
Faith seers need samurais to catch the L
Special research vessels made for catching whales
Filet-o-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails
Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell
Maybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never fail
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairy tale
Or maybe just a metal pail you hit with steel tools
To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of SEAL school
Just like trout jumping out their house to let their gills cool
Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool
Yeah, I said it feels cool to kill fools
Slipping through the cracks like when you try to grill gruel
Techno Viking water bottle and not following pill rules
Will have you off the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood
Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your milieu
Simple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practising stillness
Real Steel til' he realize his realness
Defeat Samsara, achieves nirvana and brilliance
Yeah!"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	Relax With Pep	Don’t Sweat the Technique	1992	[Verse 1]	"My styles will move, I'm calm but deadly, heat up but cool
I'm rough as a right hook but still look smooth, even when I'm unseen
I show and prove - women, I give 'em pain and still soothe
As I'll put you down but I'm hard to put up with
Swell up like helium but I can make it fit
I'm taking what I want and make you wanna give it here
Provoking you to flaunt, you get the idea
Got it, gone, my schedule is packed
My day is laidback 'cause I'm ahead of all that
Then I can relax 'cause I'm before my time
I hand you a manual before the rhymes
So you can catch up and keep up and move right along
The day is kind of off but I can get it on
I'm taking it step by step and when the night is in depth
It's cool cause I'm relaxed with pep"

Westchester, King/Drew, then we function
Little nigga, but that dog in me, that’s on Top
On my kids, I'll sock you niggas up
Have you ever took a fade and ran three more back to back?
Oh, you haven't? Then shut the fuck up and keep it rap
Gah, gah, gah
Bitch, I’m from the LAnd
Don't say you hate L.A. when you don't travel past the 10
Am I trippin'? Yes, I am
Meditate over some money, I see Franklin, I find zen
Bitch, I'm from the LAnd
Don't say you hate L.A., but live in L.A. and pretend
My neck on Tarantino, Alejandro, Spike Lee
Just know you took the scenic route if you stand by me, stupid"

Keep the party crackin, while I'm steady rappin

My Neighborhood shirt and my Eddie Chen CLOT
Shit might not go to college but my street smart polished
Like the black fingernails of that punk rock logic
Do the knowledge: man, you can't be punk from projects
Firm disbeliever in your punch clock promise
Was trading off my comics, I was taking them to school
One of Jay-Z boys, now I'm skating in your pool
Not to be rude, I'm just hating on your rules
Like a young 50, I'm on my world tour
Good morning, Singapore, I'm bringing the sun with me
From the Robert Taylor homes to Africa's slum cities
I am American mentally with Japanese tendencies

Run up on my old schools, see what the semi do

White-tee, Dickies saggin', G-Unit sneaks
Twelve-inch cross-fires, you can still hear my speakers
Dre started gangsta rappin', niggas still sleepin'
Cashville, Ten-a-ki, Compton still got 'em cheaper
Feds on Nextels, we still carry beepers
Stash hold everythin', fire arms, cocaine
Drive-bys leave ya brains hangin' like my gold chain
Ten G's on you fitted, fuckin' with my dope game
Ski mask, climbin' through your window like Bruh-Man
In the hood, fiends snitchin' on niggas for quarter rock
Everybody on the floor, face down, gun shot
All black bandana, infrared, pass the Glock
Phantom in the drive way, let the motherfuckin' neighborhood watch"

For some tickets to the playoffs, but the Hornets, they won
Nigga, we slum, kept all the guns, I gotta protect my family
I drove the biggest thing in the house 'cause I knew they'd try to ram me
But I'm stabbing, making a path on expressway the best way I know how
Look up in the sky, east, west, no clouds
Him coming now, fuck that money now
I ask my honey how she feeling and is Jordan okay? ""Yeah, yeah, she chillin'""
We should be at The Dungeon shortly, ain't nobody on they porch, see?
Approaching the final exit, I'm thinking I see four horsies
But I don't though, nigga, you won't know until it's on ya
I put that on my dope boys from A-Town to California
All the weed smell like ammonia, but at the Dungeon I know they're smoking
Writing the raps and doing the beats to make this last recording
Fuck abortion, I got in the booth to run the final portion
The beat was very dirty and the vocals had distortion"

Heard a call from the other way that I just came from (""Ayy"")
Some nigga was saying something
Talking 'bout smoke something
""Hey, man, you remember me from school?"" ""No, not really""
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made""
And I replied that I'd been going through the same things that he has
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
I live by the beat like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet, then, I don't eat, so we like neck-to-neck

It's juvenile, delusional, as usual
You're beautiful, I'm average (Woo)
I'm brutal, you're a savage
My ride or die chick who's always cruising for a bruising
Yeah, it's kinda like we're tryna light a dynamite stick
Though we might get along like shit
Fight, hit, bite, spit, unite, split
Yeah, you're awful, but you're mine
And they say love is blind, we see each other fine
But it's no wonder I'm (Yeah) the only one you'll find (Uh)
To put up with your shit (What?), I need a plumber line (Yeah)
But nothing comes to mind (Nah) besides the number 90 (No)
'Cause since '06 you flipped my fucking life, upside down
Now the sky's ground, look at my frown, it's a smile now
Look at my mouth, it's my eyebrows, make it rain upwards
We're on that ninth cloud, two insane lovebirds
I should fly south, 'cause man am I great, ain't lyin' to myself
But I'm just plain stubborn, I'm Audi five thou'
But this is my house, bitch, you get out
Then we duke it out, then it dies down
Then we say, ""Fuck it"", cry our eyes out

To stimulate, then activate the left and right brain
Said, ""Baby boy, you only funky as your last cut
You focus on the past, your ass'll be a has-what
That's one to live by or either that's one to die to
I try to just throw it at you, determine your own adventure, André""
Got to her station, ""Here's my destination""
She got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head for hours
Took a shower, kinda sour 'cause my favorite group ain't comin' wit' it
But I'm witcha 'cause you probably goin' through it anyway
But anyhow, when in doubt
Went on out and bought it 'cause I thought it would be jammin'
But examine all the flawsky-wawsky, awfully
Sad and it's costly, but that's all she
Wrote, and I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shit's creek, ""It's weak"" is the last quote
That I wanna hear when I'm goin' down
When all's said and done and we got a new joe in town
When the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down
All y'all can say is, ""Them niggas earned the crown,"" but until then"

Got my gold watch and my gold chain
With my fancy car and my diamond ring
With my fancy broad and she foreign
So it's no words and it's no slang
And I'm no trick and I'm no lame
It's just so slick that she's so game, and it's

Of a lesser, God, I Master like Farad
Persona in between the El Rook'n, and El DeBarge
Metaphorically massage, verbal hajj
I take over breaks and chop loops
Glorifying, one-eighty hat cats can rock in my troops
Wisdom like a tooth, mock new shits I knock loose
Dating game Thursday's I spot juice, Plug like Posdnuos
Before you get a style, let's get a style
My style pans the crowd back and forth
You were soft as the tracks you rappin off, I pop shit
You tried to laugh it off, actin like you had to cough
And didn't hear it, my spirit sustains in the same pattern
Emcee, familiar sample period; spotting where you sampled
Your rhyme scheme from -- I ain't clearin it
I drop science and experiment -- contractually
Came to terms of endearment with my label
Want to pick out a day to smack wack niggas, I contact niggas
Like P.O.'s, you spit background lyrics, I rip Lee flows
Wiping your nose like you need blows
Claiming it's a allergy, I react allergic to cats
Or is it how they word it
If you had weight it must have been some pussy you served with
Thoughts fermented, I rode rhythms and words tinted
Many lip profess, I'm verb centered"
Travis Scott	33	Nightcrawler	Rodeo	2015	[Verse 2]	"Dope, I'm so dope

I got this money, tell me what you want
For this money, can you drop it low?"

See me I been grinding across the globe (Uh-huh)
I hustle hard to get the grip fa'sho
So when I make time to call you, you should pick up the phone
Tell me, what's on your mind when you alone
I have you touching on ya self, girl all in the zone
Now if I turned you on
With things I say, would I be wrong?
Then I don't wanna be right
Matter of fact, I'd be on the next flight
Tryna get it on with you tonight
Do the things you like
Touch the right spot, have ya piping hot
While the wind blow through ya hair in the drop
Just lay back, relax to the sounds of the sax
And let me do what I do until you climax
You can go straight to sleep after it's all over
In the morning, roll over and we can start over"

I know they got my phone tapped, I'm screaming, ""Fuck Jake!""
I'm tryna stay out them pens, so I switched states
Bad news, VA, now, that sounds great
I see niggas with that ice on, rims shined up
This town's one big pussy, waiting to get fucked
I holla at A.I. peoples to get gats
They charge me 500 apiece for two MACs
Then I'm back doing me, I'm back out on a spree
Catch me a nigga slipping out, pumping that D
Get me a little crew, I'll have 'em pumping for me
The more product I take, the more paper we see
Change my name in NY, they don't know where I be
Yeah, a nigga doing dirt, but a nigga low-key"

We trap out this bitch 'til the police raid it
I seen that coco turn bad when it get in the pot
I'm sorta like a chef when I'm over the pot
I'm sorta like a ref when we talk 'bout these streets
Whistle official, my pocket gorilla
We trap out these buildings and make us some millions
Poverty didn't get the best of my game
We took all this game and went bought us some chains
We fucking these bitches, ain't none of 'em gettin' claimed
I'm straight up deranged
I jump out the Range
I go to the Flame on a Wednesday
That molly, that drank and that kush
I think I went over my limit
Stack after stack after stack
I'm throwin' this shit to the ceiling
Got three Audemars and a Bentley
And it's one hell of a feeling"

What's the dealings? (huh) It's like New York's been soft
Ever since Snoop came through and crushed the buildings
I'm trying to restore the feelings; fuck the law, keep dealing
More money, more cash, more chilling
I know they gon' criticize the hook on this song
Like I give a fuck...I'm just a crook on this song

The crowd gets charged, I speed it up
They couldn't get warm, gimme a cut
The rhyme gets good, so eat it up
Food for thought until your thoughts is sore
Fill up a coliseum, I can serve them all
Bake another plate, and cook it far from raw
And if you're overweight, then here's some more

If I sold a third of my rhymes, I make a killing
Get the salt and pepper from the maid
Get the blood off the blade, pass the hand grenade"

But even white Air Force ones come in two's
Yeah, I like her and I like you too
What's wrong? She my bitch and you my boo
She got a Range Rover Sport, you got a Bentley coupe
She take my clothes to the cleaners, you take Harlem to school
I gave you the Birkin bags so I made a mistake
And Oprah don't fuck with them no more anyway
I'm sorry for the bullshit I put you through
But I ain't goin' nowhere, I got a kid wit'chu
Why we always gotta argue about Superhead's book
She sucked my dick with a condom on, after that I shook
And when she start talking about buying a ring
I just turn the volume up and let Jamie Foxx sing"

I probably should, these problems are pilin' all at once

I think I'm bottomin' out, but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank God, I got a little girl
And I'm a responsible father, so not a lot of good
I'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood ‘cause I don't know how I do it
All I know is I don't wanna follow in the footsteps
Of my dad, ‘cause I hate him so bad

Learn a little bit, earn a little more
A close mouth don't defend dip behind doors
This is my insurence just to reinsure
Its hard to exist, in this existence
Pistol blazing fifths in this existence
I tra-vel a million miles just so-I can see
A million in one miles, a million in one thousand

I ain't talkin' romance, but you'll get swept off your feet
I keeps a ghetto chick that loves to blast and she peddle shit
Groupies fake moves, I get her to settle shit
You can't compare to the status right here
Legendary worldwide, we can battle right here
Listen, Junior, I'ma tear back your wig
This ain't TV, but I'll show you what a ""fear factor"" is
Stop grillin' me, and all that frontin' is killin' me
You leave me no choice but to hurt your feelings, G"

Ounce of killa dilla, be making my game more flagrant
And once I done had some Cuervo 'bout six shots I'm nothin to play wit

An old school playa pimp type ass nigga like Tony Mercedes
And will work every last muscle off in your body like Billy Blanky
Hanky panky, where did you get your gold grill cause it's banging
And I like them hot red Fila straight from Walters off the chain
Fuck them bouige bitches they don't know nothin 'bout you

Hip-hop critics, sit the fuck down, get a chair or two
I ain't tryna kick knowledge, just a pair of graphic parables
Grew up, spent the whole middle school in the same pair of shoes
Me and my brother sharing shoes, my childhood was terrible
That's why I spend nights on the rooftop, smoking medical
You got a minute, my nigga? Let me break down the variables
Adapted to my surroundings, flow better than I used to
Momma, this for us buyers, for the days I wore FUBU
Having beaucoup dreams, deuce-deuce in jeans, my nigga

Is they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, mane
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'
How when I know what a blood diamond is?
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryna get that ice
On a Polo rugby, it look so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight, because"

Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration
Damn, I'm gettin' aggravated
Fuck, I'm gettin' agitated
Teachers so underpaid in these fuckin' schools
The police got our name in all they databases
Girls be thirteen actin' twenty-two
Niggas be forty-four actin' half they ages
Somebody tell me, what the fuck is goin' on?
These niggas in tight shit, I'm in the fuckin' Matrix
It's lookin' like a sign of the revelation
'Bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest
I got all these patients, man
How come they ain't patient with me?
They just think I want the money

Nas too real, Nas, true king
It's however you feel, go 'head, you swing
Your arms too short to box with God
I don't kill soloists, only kill squads
Fame went to they head, so now it's ""Fuck Nas""
Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys
I seen it coming soon as I popped my first bottle
I spotted my enemies tryna do what I do
Came in with my style, so I fathered you
I kept changing on the world since Barbeque
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
Fuck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said
If I ever make a record, I'll take a check
And put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, ten years deep
Since the project bench with cracks in my sock, 'sleep
I never asked to be top of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna learn the craft of the streets
But look at me now"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Kick, Push II	Lupe Fiasco’s Food & Liquor	2006	[Verse 2]	"You see, his mom was a crackhead
And his father couldn't be contacted
He lived with being different, was combatted
Amongst the other things on his young, black head
And see, his girl was a white girl
But just 'cause she was white, see, her life wasn't light-world
She, too, had the drama thick
Had a daddy and a mama, but her daddy used to mama-hit
Daddy caught something chasin' fatties, made her mama sick
Couldn't afford the medicine, pimped her to the pharmacist
Had suicidal feelings
But riding switch over the transitions help her conquer it
Pays for her mama's pills with a sponsorship
Her cell phone bill and a Honda kit, uh-huh
And that's why she skates with he
Someone to feel her pain and a place to be"

I'm the motherfuckin' snare when it touch the beat
I'm the 808 drum that got you movin' your feet
I'm the heir to the throne after the D-R-E
Product of my environment, you old-ass niggas
Get ready for your early retirement
Before I let hip-hop burn down I run in the building like a fireman
Who can outspit me when I'm high off sticky
Throwin' back Patron shots in some creased up dickies

I'm in the backseat of your truck with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin' to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face — what now?
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth? How?
Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn 'em around? (Look)
I'll burn your fuckin' house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out (Oh my God! Oh my God!)
I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
You want me to fix up lyrics while our president gets his dick sucked?
Fuck that! Take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin' to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement (The kids!)

Who ill as me? I wild on haters in album three
Next level — I take y'all niggas to 3-D

Floating in this game of life despite how out of place you may feel
In this race, oh you just can't quit
Ain't that a bitch that be in heat
I'm on the beat like cops
Only cultivate the stable dirt when I skeet my drops
No concentrating knocking other niggas out the box
Why? 'Cause in a sense, see, we all be kind of fly
Just can't be scared to spread your wings, head to better things

Chumps are leary though, they see me as a threat
I'm like the black Dutch Schultz when you get me upset
5-0 makes me wanna flip, Larry Davis style
Got a nigga depressed, while he's awaiting trial
It's OK though, cause from grey skies come blue
Through darkness comes light and I be known as the Guru
And this I certify we all should be alerted by
The traps within the system our youth is getting murdered by
The D.A. says they got me on a felony
I'm trying to live my life, so what the fuck is you telling me?
The streets are war, that's what brothers carry weapons for
And I take the weight as I did before
The next thing you know, they got me on the radio
A rapper arrested, suckers showing me on video
Of course I know that I'm a role model
But yo, this rap life is real life: sometimes it's full throttle
Right now I gotta think about me; fuck the industry
You gets no love except those who support me
What's the story? What happened when I went to L.A.?
Mixing shit up, no not there I got family
Nothing happened, mind your business, yo, step
You know we connect - JFK to LAX"

Praying Private Ryan comes 'round
Sound travels at one-thousand-one-thirty feet per second
Niggas in the street they want it, hurry
When niggas stop biting that's when 3000 starts to worry
A little knowledge from the college of wizard Ray Murray
Answer quick: do you know what desire is? (Huh?)
Apparently not, that's why you get what you got
Now answer this: do you know what fire is? (Yeah!)
The body of hot, the motivator of pots
Snot, spit, shit are characteristics of release
Ask your niece or nephew, you think we left you
What the future holds in its sweaty palms
Think I'm finna vom'?
You move it like you mean it, she'll come
Prom night might excite a down right fight like
White blood cells to the common cold rebel
Night gets jealous of day, play is no longer
The feelin' gets stronger than ammonia sticks inhale"
Nas	9	Black Girl Lost	It Was Written	1996	[Verse 1]	"A young, wild, beautiful love child
You like 'em thug style, link rocking, then mink copping
Hit you on the sink, a hundred dollar drink popping
The head'll make 'em take you shopping, a foul doctrine
Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit
Chanel, looking real, airbrushed nails
Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent 
To see ya prophecy, your ebony tone is locking me
The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
Wishing I could be the one man
But you juggle way too many willies all in one hand
You wanna run up in clubs, getting rubbed on
Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear, get your fuck on
Following week, you back there, but what you stuck on?
Weed, clowns and cars
Puffing with some lil nigga, husband not knowing she's out
Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas
Niggas thirst you, you just let 'em hurt you and leave
What up, ma? Fronting like you naive
Push your man's whip, calling police when you flip
Can't understand it, yo, it should be a throne for us
But for now, that's a whole different zone from us, word!"

But I'ma say it for 'em, stop it, pop it, rewind and play it for 'em
This nigga's a bitch like his wife
Suge Knight's a bitch, and that's on my life
And I'ma let the whole world see
'Cause you fucked up the industry, and that's on me
We can go head up, nigga, set it up
Or we can do the other thing, I love to wet it up
Your rappers and artists, tell 'em, shut it up
'Cause I'll fuck every last one of 'em up, especially Kurupt (Shhhhhhh)
See that's my lil' homeboy, so he knows what's up (what's up)
He better keep it Crippin', and slip his clip in
'Cause these niggas trippin', this is official business
Do the same way, leave no witnesses
This is that unexpected, misdirected, sprayed, covered and protected
Strip you butt naked, chicky-check-check-it
It's all to the good again
You can catch Snoopy D.O. double in the hood again (Eastside Rollin)
Spinning that real times, spitting that real shit
To make the whole world feel it (Feel it)
So put the bacon in the skillet (Hahaha), and try to peel it

I'm buyin' out the department, goin' to galaxy
I'm prayin' to find a plug to bring me Actavis
Bought a crib in every city, I forget my address
I been hustlin' since a kid, I was just a adolescent
I done ran up a Richard Millie, I can't stop finessin'
Got to practice what I preach, I'm buyin' my bitch baguettes
I got money, but ain't got time, these hoes gettin' too obsessed

Laced in Balenci' and got Marni on my body gear

Play with Scooter and I'ma sеnd a nigga outta here"

Flip be down on 1-0-9, rollin' up smoke
Shameek, he a thief, catch a stunt in a stolen car
He that nigga that you call when you crashin' into a bar
See they love me 'cause I rap now, but they don't like me
I been locked up three times and they ain't write me
Stevie a punk, but fuck what he say, he can get mean quick
Pop shots at you, Esau must suck a mean dick
The block's hot, D's jump out on us almost all the time
They watch us from the building but niggas still be on the grind
Wayne used to call the cops and tell them G had a 9

I ain't shoot nobody, I ain't shank nobody, I ain't kill nobody

I hold you down if I never see you again
I put that on my kids
I sweat them blood tears
I trade places with you, and do some of your years
I confronted my fears
I roll up a fat one and disappear on the pier
I wish you niggas was here and
Just the other day I, was riding through the old hood
Feelin' like the old Suge, me and my city both good
I understand I've been misunderstood
Niggas hate me cause they wishin' they could

Punk ass niggas
It's called betrayal)
He on a mission to become a ball player
Flip big Benz's, flossin' all gators
Had it all mapped out, a 6'8"" 12th grader
Fresh outta school and finna go make paper
He had a brother who was hustlin', collectin' his change
Never let his baby brother stick his neck in the game
Told him all he had to do is just enjoy the ride
And he ain't have to worry about money cause that's in time
So now he's pacin' as the time moves slowly
Can't wait to face Shaquille in the paint and school Kobe
Kept his grades and stayed up under neighborhood functions
And then a group of knuckleheads came through dumping
So now he's sittin' on the sidewalk bleeding
Fell into a puddle of his own blood and stopped breathin'
And everybody in the neighborhood still grievin'
But destiny caught up with his ass and he got even
And all the cryin' in the world ain't goin' to bring him back
His brother, sittin' at the wake wipin' tears from his mother's eyes
Why'd the game have to go and take the young boys life
Only the wicked live shife, payin' the price
While he's starin' at the shell his brother's soul once held
The trigger man made bail
And you, wouldn't pay the boy his mail, and sacrificed your fuckin' family
That's betrayal
Betrayal (echoes)"

We’re still breathing and just leave it at THAT!
'Cause if me and 50 and G-Unit hop back in that BAT!—mobile
It ain't gonna be no more rap it's gonna be BRRRRAT!
Retaliation, it'll be like them Muslim Shi'a ATTACKS!
Somewhere along the line it's like me and 50 made a PACT!
He's got my back, I got his back (BACK!)
It's almost like we're kinda, like Siamese twins
'Cause when we beef, we pull each other in, to the bullshit
Like we're conjoined at the hip, this is unavoidable
Some of the shit is squashable; some shit'll never boil over
Some of it will just simmer at best, if left alone
But let it be known there will be no sit-downs with no Daves and 'Zinos, there will be no peace discussions with me
There ain't gon' be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea
Just quit fuckin' with me and I'll gladly quit fuckin' with you

My main man, my son, Common Sense
They used to call me No Sense

You know, I’m just checking him out
See what’s going on, cause I’m always sitting around telling him about
What we used to do back in our hood, you know
We used to be down and run this town
And it was all at PC Pub
You know, and I’m shaking
And they working on it, and they bringing it back
I see harmony, understanding
And they working on that love thing too
Cause they be down with it, you know?
Now I hear them saying things like, whoa whoa, I get a good feeling
I be saying “keep it up
Keep on moving with your groove, you’re going the right way""
Cause it’s got to be in your heart
And I can tell by your beat, you got it
See there, I can do a little piece, put them together there
Yeah, we used to be running this whole town, here
We used to be basketball playing brothers, you know
Now everybody’s playing basketball
I wonder where they come from? What they claiming?
Gonna make an old man get his shoes out
And throw one down to slam dunk on them
Every time the leaves start turning brown getting through the fall of the year
I can say yea it’s time to play some
What these youngsters talking about, they running out of breath?
What you say?
Well I tell what, we’re gonna try something brand new here
Cause everybody like new things
We’re gonna work on something new, and I’m gonna call it ‘peace’
We’re gonna pretend like its 6 years old
And we gonna build it and mould it
And nurture it and culture it
And grow right into our society for all of us to have
Do you believe in the peace?
Not that piece, but do you believe in the peace?
Alright, I see you raising your hand - you believe in the peace
OK, bring it
See if I can’t talk common sense into them
Let’s cruise on down to 47 St. where dad used to hang out at, you know?
Eh remember in a few years when we moved from 47 to 87
47 was my hood, 87 was his
Touchdown
What’s the name of the bangers in this town now?
Has everybody calmed down?
Back in my day, they was showing up, now they finally woke up
I hear they leaving it alone
Using words like 'truce', I love to hear that"

Hell nah, we don't surf, we halfway go to church
Tell you the truth, shit, right now I'm in a fucking hearse

But it is your day to get buried by a verse
It'll be another ten years 'fore you see an MC Ren here
Where he been, I've been there, that Lambo, I'm in there
Hotter than the beginning of my career with 50, Dre and Em there
Top off the Murcielago like Victoria's Secret swimwear
So, listen, I'm so sincere, 'bout to work out like gym wear
Murder MTV's top ten and tat my face with ten tears
That's ten funerals, ten caskets
Ten three-piece Ralph Lauren suits, ten motorbikes stopping traffic
And ten reasons why I got California hotter than acid

You fuckin' with a general
No discussion is the principle, we bust and it's the end of you
Now we knockin' on your mama door
Like we came to fix the sink, my kind of war
Death angels coming for you
Spirit horse runnin' from your body like Young Guns 1 and 2
Paramedics fightin' for you, who's gon' win?
The hands of time, or the hands of medicine?
Don't cry, witness your fate, this is your wake
Walk by your casket, spit in your face
Enter the fog, dawg, the light is your guide
And when you're gone all your niggas gon' light it with Nas"
Eminem	15	Legacy	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 3]	"I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
‘Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this
And connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
‘Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit
Now you shut up, bitch, I am talkin'
Thought I was full of horseshit
And now you fuckin' worship the ground on which I am walkin'
Me against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0-16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins
‘Cause you dicks butt kiss, bunch of Brian Baldingers
You're gon' die a ball-licker, I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind, y'all can
Suck a dick; the day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flyin' saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exaltin' and I ain't haltin'

Get claptized and set straight, put on your head straight

Be leery of New Yiddy niggas with gats with the wall on they back
Rikers Island flashbacks of the house you got scufted in
You would think that gettin' your head shot's enough, but then
Now you wanna go at my team
Must have been drunk when you wrote that shit
Too bad you had to did it to your own self
My rebellion, retaliate
I had the whole New York state
Aimin' at your face at the gate
Bottom line off top soon as you came through
Shots flew, don't even know the half of my crew
I got a hundred strong-arm niggas ready to rock your shit
Clocks tick, your days are numbered in low digits
You look suspicious, suspect niggas is bitches
Get chopped up, Grade A meat, somethin' delicious
And laced back up, two G's worth of stitches
To reconstruct your face and learn how to speak again
My mob's like a bunch of wild Puerto Ricans
With bangers the size of African spears, it's warfare
In the arena, we turn arenas into house of horrors
It's Terrordome, when you see my clique, you need to run behind shit
You got a gat, you better find it
And use that shit, think fast and get reminded
Of robberies in Manhattan, you know what happened
Sixty G's worth of gun clappin'
Who shot ya?
You probably screamed louder than an opera
New York got ya
Now you wanna use my Mobb as a crutch
What you think, you can't get bucked again?
Once again"

Would you ride then, if I wasn't driving
If I wasn't a eight-figure nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me
If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya
See yourself with a nigga working hard at a nine to five
Ten to six, two jobs to survive, or

You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the colorblind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart

Common	22	A Song for Assata	Like Water for Chocolate	2000	[Verse 1]	"There were lights and sirens, gunshots firing
Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent
Seemed like a bad dream, she laid in a blood puddle
Blood bubbled in her chest, cold air brushed against open flesh
No room to rest, pain consumed each breath
Shot twice with her hands up
Police questioned but shot before she answered
One Panther lost his life, the other ran for his
Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
Comprehension she was beyond, trying to hold on
To life; she thought she'd live with no arm
That's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight
They moved her room to room; she could tell by the light
Handcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin, it bit
Put guns to her head, every word she got hit
""Who shot the trooper?"" they asked her
Put mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her
Her mind raced till things got still
Opened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed
She got chills, they told her: that's where she would be next
Hurt mixed wit anger, survival was a reflex
They lied and denied visits from her lawyer
But she was building as they tried to destroy her
If it wasn't for this German nurse they would've served her worse
I read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse
I wonder what would happen if that would've been me?
All of this just so we could be free
So dig it, y'all"
Eminem	15	Rap God	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Chorus]	"I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God

Police to help you, believe me"
The Game	13	Ain’t Fuckin’ With You	LAX	2008	[Verse 3]	"'Fore I break you off like a Kit Kat, you know I wanna hit that
Banana split that, but a real nigga had to sit back
'Cause that's what we do when girls be with the chit-chat
Every mornin' on *The View*, them girls be with the chit-chat
Enough with all the riff-raff, let me see your cat walk
I'm old school, Garfield, I can make your cat talk
But I'm a gangsta, so I'ma back off
Keyshia and DMX, I'll leave yo' ass with that thought
For real"
Eminem	15	Stepdad	Music to Be Murdered By	2020	[Verse 1]	"One thing that sticks in my craw
When I was six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my Ma
Socked her right in her eyeball
I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic
With all the pictures I draw of
Shit that I've already witnessed, it’s probably twisted my thoughts
All I can hear is drama with Mom and him
I can always hear 'em arguin' down the hallways
The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
Our dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
Doctors had to put it down
He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!"

The Game	13	Dreams	The Documentary	2005	[Verse 2]	"I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mýa
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things,,,
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'Til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
'Cause a dream is kin to your last breath"

And I'm for sure I'm gon' be murdered for this shit that I done
But I'ma die standin' up, 'cause I'm a stand-up nigga
Fuck dyin' like a bitch on my knees, I'm a killer
So don't nobody cry 'cause I was destined to get it
Just remember, I'm the one who took the dope game and flipped it
And pimped it, and destroyed everything in the way
Of me seein' first motherfuckin' light of the day
A trigger man, deadly as fuck with a loaded AK
Spot my enemy and kill him the American way
I turned a dream into reality with a fuck you mentality
Silencin' all these niggas in the neighborhood who challenged me
Family grievin' from they loved one's fatality
He ain't got a reason to die then kill him, it's a tragedy"
Prodigy	8	Give It Up Fast	Hell On Earth	1996	[Verse 4]	"Yeah, yo, cannons erupt, you got strucked up abstrusely
Some rapper nigga playin' thug tried to approach me (Yo, kill that nigga, man)
Alls I remember was I shot for his throat, G
You see big guns in 3D, it's haunting
It gets deep, fucking with these Chinese
Thai weed burnin' my hip from hot gats
Burning my lip from roach clips
Catch me on the 40th and Bootlegger in the AM
These ante meridian cats, insomniacs
Four in the morning, we throwing back some cognac juice
Lettin' gats loose, the blue van blitz through
D's pissed too, couldn't find the pistol, ayo
Hopped out the Lexus holdin' my necklace
I'm bent off some next shit, gasoline with a kerosene twist
Stumbling, placing my gun right, it slipped down its caliber
Lookin' for chicks that he can stab now
Numbed up from a fiery cup of hell juice
It's sin's nectar, Satan's fountain of youth
Mega action, bitches all around ready to fuck
Big asses, you raw-dogging shit, pressing your luck
My pipe game's like a night train
Top speed through your womb-piece
Rated X to say the least, ayo"

Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car

She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache, uh
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh

Yeah, Dad, I'm the epitome and the prime
Example of what happens when the power of the rhyme
Falls into the wrong hands and
Makes you want to get up and start dancin'

Laughin' all the way to the bank, lampin' in my K-Mart mansion
I’m in the style department
With a pile in my cart, rippin' the aisle apart but
With great power comes
Absolutely no responsibility for content
Completely despondent and condescending
The king of nonsense and controversy is on a
Beat-killing spree, Your Honor
I must plead guilty, 'cause I sparked a revolution
Rebel without a cause who caused the evolution
Of rap, to take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
(""Hip-hop is the Devil's music"")
Does that mean it belongs to me?
'Cause I just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you hear a beep
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper

No, you ain't shit, you say you love 'em, I know you don't mean it
I know you irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence? Where was your support that you pretend?
You ain’t no brother, you ain’t no disciple, you ain’t no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit, or leave his best friend, little brother
You promised you’d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas? On the road, bottles and bitches
You FaceTimed him one time, that's unforgiven
You even FaceTimed instead of a hospital visit
Guess you thought he'd recover well
Third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say, ""You fuckin' failed,"" you ain't try"

Murder me now but see me later man, that's on my pops

Aight, bet, so just hold it down
While I cock back the long three pound
You're upstairs boning, not knowing that I'm scheming
Just the right time, kid, it's twelve in the evening
You're leaving out the building as you kiss your girl goodbye
Thought you was safe and got caught by surprise
""What's going on?"" as I reply
""Shut the fuck up and don't make this to another homicide""
He tried to play tough so I put one in his brain
Even though I took his life, all I wanted was his chain
Come through truck without heat, how you figure?
When you in the projects, keep your fingers on the trigger
But fuck that, we juxing
If you got what we like, it gets tooken
Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo, good looking
Now we catching a cab to Halsey & Lewis in Brooklyn
Getting tore up from the floor up, hit the dress store up
Got the 80 auto in case a nigga wanna roll up
Get your motherfucking shit swoll up
Now it's back to Queens to serve fiends
Making G's by any means, my eyes on my enemies
Sipping Hennessy, with my mind on some crime shit
One-time searching me, but never ever find shit
It's the everyday, get the loot then breeze
Though my goal is to leave outta state, push ki's
But all this bullshit holding me down, I can't leave
Fuck a 9-to-5, I get the loot with ease
Don't even need a degree to earn a six-digit figure
I get mines slinging on the corner with my niggas
Pulling the trigger when the drama appears
'Cause a nigga worse enemy is fear

Still want to kill niggas
Tried to go work, but work ain't work
Work ain't work for the feel nigga
Really make me feel like a field nigga
Make me feel worse, really tryna' chill
But inside I feel like a steel mill, nigga
And it's hard when these niggas steal mama (what)
When you ain’t got, got a meal still mama
Living off a meal deal mama
Can't stunt with them lil wheels mama
Need a real purse, real heels mama
How dem liquors and them pills feel mama? Lil mama"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Fighters	Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool	2007	[Verse 1]	"Or is it something they can never believe?
Or is it something you can never achieve?
Is it beyond your means? Is it inside your dreams?
Can it never come out cause it's scared to, unprepared to
Too worried about the words of the people it's weird to
You don't want them to hear you
You just wish there was a door that would appear
That you can go disappear through
Well I'm feeling your pain
I was feeling the same, but I said I'd never feel that again"
Prodigy	8	Right Back at You	The Infamous	1995	[Verse 1]	"Yeah, yeah, check it out!
Now run for your life, or you wanna get your heat?
Whatever, we can die together
As long as I send your maggot ass to the essence
I don't give a fuck about my presence
I'm lost in the blocks of hate, and can't wait
For the next crab nigga to step and meet fate
I'm lethal when I see you, there is no sequel
24/7, MAC-11 is my peoples
So why you wanna end your little life like this?
'Cause now you've bumped heads with kids that's lifeless
I live by the day only if I survive the last night
Damn right! I ain't tryna fight
We can settle this like some grown men on the concrete floor
My slugs will put a stop to your hardcore ways of action
I grab the gat then ain't no turnin' back when I start blastin'
Pick up the handle and insert the potion
Cock the shit back in a calm-like motion
No signs of anger or fear 'cause you the one in danger
Never share your plans with a stranger, word is bond
Check it out, now!"
50 Cent	19	Hate It or Love It (G-Unit Remix)	The Massacre	2005	[Verse 1]	"Comin up I was confused, my mommy kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out commitin felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check, check out my melody""
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could"

Lupe Fiasco	23	No Scratches	Tetsuo & Youth	2015	[Chorus]	"Patience
But then that patience turned to waiting
And then that waitin’ turned to wasting your time, your time, your time
And then that wasting turned to hating
And then that hating got to racing
All inside your mind, your mind, your mind, your mind
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak, and it crashes
Just walk away, no scratches (no stratches)
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak, and it crashes
Just walk away, no scratches (no scratches)
First we had patience"

Bitches get cold in the summer, keep a mink

Twin bitches, twin bitches
Twin bitches hoppin' off a jetski"

See I stayed the same, ain't go weird like Lupe
Squeeze on this trigger like ain't no more toothpaste

You want this money, you gon' have to drive the course I did
I got that Wraith out, you talking 'bout the Porsche out here

How a nigga with a rojo rag end up in Soho
Bag, any bitch walking with a solo swag

The Game	13	Angel	LAX	2008	[Verse 3]	"Fly away, fly away
My love for her is not about jewelry and cars
I love her 'cause she love me, just for who I are
Who I is, who I am, resembles the rims on the Lam'
I shine like Shyne when Barrington Levy was sayin'
""Didilly whoooa!"", I got love for the streets
Peace to New York and every hood in the East
Before I was duckin' cops, gunshots
I used to be an L.A. Dodger, now I'm a (angel)
From the city of lost souls, Impalas and polished gold
Between the car and the rims, we got a lot of chrome
Your hood not alone, they knockin', we not at home
And when they bust in, we not Caesar, but gotta roam
'Cause they try to wire phones, I'm talking Verizon phones
The ones they put wires on, they got us on tap
But I put wires on, my Bentley in fact
I spit it through the wires on a Kanye track"
Common	22	Payback Is a Grandmother	Like Water for Chocolate	2000	[Verse 1]	"There was a Hardy Boy mystery I tried to solve again
Dude that broke in my crib - it wasn't involvin him
Four in the mornin, my phone ringin
I'm thinkin, ""Who da fuck is this,"" on the other line screamin
Told em, ""Geek down,"" but they was breathin hard
It was my grandmother tellin me that she had been robbed
I told her hold (hold) tight (tight), I'd be right over
Freezin but this situation made the night colder
Knew this was the night (that what?) that she played poker
With some friends in a club at the boat gettin bub'
Said she seen these thugs on the boat for a while (uhh)
Not gamblin but every now and then they'd smile
Then BLAOW! They up mags
And told everybody, ""Put your shit in the bag""
Made people strip naked, quicker than a Luke record (what?)
Had the place took in a minute and some seconds
Asked her how many of it was em? (How many of it was em?)
Said she couldn't remember
She was spooked and buzzin, couldn't describe em
Cause it happened too fast (what?) said they looked like me
With they pants hangin off they ass
Got her some water - and begin to think
How these niggas take her wig, her bracelet and her mink?
Somebody round the crib know the deal (uhh)
Whoever did it better have Blue Shield for real
'Cause yo, it's the big payback..

I done fucked with Kiki and Lili and Nini
I text her ""So proud of you"" when I got my B from CC
It is no way that you can know or see the things we see (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
She said that she can tell every time that I lie through my teeth
Plus I know you had somebody else right here in my sheets
Oh, you think you know my body?
Pull up in that Coupe, don't want no shawty
I put rubies on my Rollie, now their eyes bleed
I don't own no ice cream truck, just know my ice freeze
Man, I read her text, she said, ""Girl, I creamed""
Man, I know she duckin' off with her side me
Who you know gon' hit it raw, baby, besides me?"
Eminem	15	Same Song & Dance	Relapse	2009	[Verse 3]	"My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works, she played a little schoolgirl when she first
Burst upon the scene and seen that the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me, it made me mad at first
I lashed out in my songs, but what was really going on
Was that I had developed a crush
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collection of skeletons, or
Footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight is the night, and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos, and just
Climb the gate, and ring the bell like, ""Hello, my love
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
I'll share my Valium with you, 'cause I'm feeling you, Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feeling you, ooh-ooh, girl, you sexy little gal, you
Hold that pill any longer, it'll get sentimental value
C'mon toots, give me the Valium alley-oop
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke
And just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm 'bout to make a new outfit out of you
New outfit? Shit, I'll make a suit out of you, shoot
Now, show me how you move, baby, do how a-you do"""

Visions and these angles tight
Truth be told, I never try
Diamonds are the wife of life

After two you get a hook-up price
Stripper never worked a nine-to-five (Hm)
Delta and I ship it overnight (Hm)
Stop tryna be God Almighty (Hm)
Fuck the money, never leave your people behind, yeah
It's never love, no matter what you try
Still can see it comin' down your eyes

When you hustle, always make it fancy (Ooh-ooh)

Ain't going in if my clique can't get in

Get that loot up, no doubt I bail mines

Have you role-playing just like an actress
My tactics leaving niggas stuck doing back flips
I black out, take it to the gats, fuck this rap shit
Let my niggas shine, rate my rhymes like a dime"

I dip through in that Six-Trey like, ""Sick 'em, Dre!""
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though (Face though)"

And keep your faith as we chase

Million-dollar Phantom, I won't even drive it

Digital, niggas never visual
Residuals, rackies comin' plentiful
Ice on my sleeve, got it out that mud
Transportin' cheese, we sellin' drugs
Tractor-trailer pull up on my way to re-up
I know when you stay down, that's the way you T up
European stylin', I go from the feet up
Every time we meet up, it's been gettin' bigger
Every presidentials, I got my credentials
Cobra deadly venom, push a button and send 'em
Raised around these sinners, now we gang members
Copped a big bazooka for my main hitter"

I be slayin' 'em fast, doin' this, that and the third
But chill, pass to Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinée
Puttin' hits on 5-0
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to Hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the Island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin' fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo I'm out"

Campbellton Road and other city streets
Enough of the verality, fallacy, butter we speak not fiction
Speaking of pulling yo girl looking at Jheri curls you bitches
Everytime I rhyme for y'all, I'm looking to prove a point
Kicking a freestyle every now and then
But mostly off the joint
See I smoke good cause see it go good wit them flows, bwoi

Inspiration when I write, I see my daughter's eyes
I'm the truth, across the table from corporate lies
Immortalized by the realness I bring to it
If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music
My music, you either fight, fuck, or dream to it
My life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it
Through my shell, never knew what the divine would bring to it
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions
More than money saved, I wanna save children
Dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity
A complex man drawn off of simplicity
Reality is frisking me
This industry will make you lose intensity
The Common Sense in me remembers the basement
I'm Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix, exposing fake shit"

Wall tellin' you that commissary is low
Race wars happenin', no callin' CO
No callin' your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is tellin' me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hopin' the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls tellin' you to listen to ""Sing About Me""
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusin' my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently servin' life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk (Talk)"

Bend corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
'Cause when we step up in the party; like a mouse, you scurry
So go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy Fat Sax, B-I-G B-O-I
Is that same motherfucker that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Giving a shoutout to my Uncle Darnell locked up in prison"
Kanye West	5	I’m In It	Yeezus	2013	[Verse 3]	"Uh, picked up where we left off
Uh, I need you home when I get off
Uh, you know I need that wet mouth
Uh, I know you need that reptile
Uh, she cut from a different textile
Uh, she love different kinds of sex now
Uh, black girl sippin' white wine
Put my fist in her like a civil rights sign
And grabbed it with a slight grind
And held it 'til the right time
Then she came like AAAAAHHH!"
Sleepy Brown	29	So Fresh, So Clean	Stankonia	2001	[Chorus]	"Ain't nobody dope as me; I'm just so fresh, so clean

Big Boi	26	Mighty “O”	Idlewild	2006	[Verse 2]	"Congratulations, I'm a player
I thought you were one too, but now I hear you loud and clear
Subliminal, criminal minded nigga, so be aware
Black dog broke out the pits and told yo' ass it's 'bout to tear
Intended for anyone fillin' out this application
An estimate is needed for your underestimation
I'm firin' on the spot, go back and check your calculations
Like a sniper in the bushes with that rifle, I've been patiently waitin'
Now that's a virtue; 'cause pussy nigga, I'll hurt you
Like the president's approval rating by servin' yo' ass with words, fool
Slam yo' back to the curb, bruh, a sanitation worker
'Cause you're trash, I'm taking out the trash and all trash
Get mashed and compacted because it's no longer valid
Go 'head recycle, repackage then put it back in my cabinet
Boy, that's germs, I'm fresh up out the store every time
That nigga the B-I-G go hard every rhyme
Crowns all around, I'm right after Martin Luther
No JR period, senior, 'cause Bamboo is Antwan Junior
Dungeon Family and biological's intact
Talk bad about the fam, catch diabolical attack
No gats or no raps, you get slapped about that
As a matter of fact, not fiction, Rumpelstiltskin, you wack
Decipher words just like the Code of Da Vinci
Don't go against me, Caine, I want you to go out there
Kill them marks and come back, is you with me?
Mighty-ighty-ighty-ighty-ighty-ighty O
The worse thing since crack cocaine distributed to the poor
By the government, oh, I meant, don't nobody know
Conspiracy theory, you be the judge, nobody's slow"

Kanye West	5	Gold Digger	Late Registration	2005	[Verse 1]	"Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said, ""I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm""
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard, she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her"
Guru	20	Suckas Need Bodyguards	Hard to Earn	1994	[Verse 2]	"Gang Starr, boy, and that's beyond your comprehension
Mad brothers in every city, you can feel the tension
To stop the killing, wack MCs must die
Who am I? I'm the substance that'll make your third eye cry
Too potent, too high in intelligence quotient
When I unleash my speech, I'll have you punk rappers hopin'
I won't expose your names and your identities
You know you're phony, get the fuck from in front of me
Hardcore fans are fed up from your folklore
Lines strip you raw and infect you like cold sores
And I hope you're not the one that I'm after
Since the days of Adidas, I've been a true master"
Travis Scott	33	guidance	Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight	2016	[Chorus]	"I roll up behind it (Yeah), I wanna try it (Yeah)
Grip up your waist, bust up the place, tantalizin' (Straight up)

The Game	13	Ol’ English	Doctor’s Advocate	2006	[Verse 1]	"Once upon a time in the projects, yo
I watched my Uncle Greg put Ds on a '6-4
I washed it on Monday so he bought me a gold chain
Chopped crack and watched ""Colors"" so I soaked up game
Drove the Impala on his lap, that was my role model
Used to let me kill the corner of his 40 ounce bottle
On the weekend him and my Pops flashed a 'Vette
Til' one weekend my uncle got stabbed to death
He got murdered by a fiend, my pops ain't like that
He was from Nutty Blocc, they used to call him Maniac
Crazy ass nigga, with a Black Panther tat'
Kill a nigga, cross him out on his Compton hat
Told me when I got older, I would understand that
It's blood in, blood out, and ain't no turnin' back
Few summers went by and we moved across the tracks
13, that's when I had my first (Olde English)"
Rakim	10	Uplift	The Master	1999	[Verse 3]	"Ghetto alert, let's do whatever work to get rid of the curse
We went from 1st to America's worst
On this competitive turf, now let's inherit the earth
Let's form plots with one another, and call shots
From 12:00 o'clock 'til the next ball drop
All year around cause we suffer nonstop
You think it's rough at the bottom, it's even rougher on top
My peeps gonna have to reach and turn for me
And everybody's side of the street'll be sunny
Ain't nothing funny, burn plenty of firm honeys
And earn money and watch the century turn 20"
Guru	20	Put Up or Shut Up	The Ownerz	2003	[Verse 1]	"Stupid, you know it's time to sit and think, before we hit the brink
Locker room, at a prize fight, before he hit the ring
Like when I tell these corporate leeches they can't get a thing
Or when I tell relentless rappers they had better sing
The position that anyone holds could be up to grabs
I'm waitin up the ave. to see if anyone folds
Since I was twenty-one years old and legal
I knew the difference between gimmicky gangsters and powerful people
I'm the reason, why the game is flipped
I'm the reason, why your aim is missed
I'm the reason why you're mad I only sprained my wrist
The reason my mindframe is trained in this
You like gunfire? better acquire the taste
'Cuz youf walk aroun' with full pounds by dem waist
Deface property, they be laced properly
Rules are rules, fools are fools, I react logically
Ain't no way, so come, make my day
Like Tom Hanks I earn long bank and +Cast+ you +Away+"
The Game	13	My Life (Original Verison)	LAX	2008	[Verse 2]	"We are not the same, I am a Martian
So approach my Phantom doors with caution
You see them 24s spinnin'? I earned 'em
And all the pictures of me and Em, I burned 'em so it ain't no proof that I ever walk through 8 Mile and since it ain't no Proof, I never walk through 8 Mile
Sometimes I think about my life, with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile 
Damn, I know his mama proud, and since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my mama now
And like M.J.B., no more drama now
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground
I spit crack, and niggas could drive it out of town
Got a Chris Paul mind state, I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty like a Glock without a round
Now my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds"
Nas	9	The World Is Yours	Illmatic	1994	[Verse 2]	"To my man Ill Will, God bless your life (It's yours)
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches, aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days when sellin' smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesús, soakin' they sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas is slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead in right direction
How you livin'? Large or broke on charge cards and mediocre?
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?"
The Game	13	On Me	The Documentary 2	2015	[Verse 3]	"There I go, give me a minute, nigga
'Bout to hit a home run, K. Dot, grab the pennant, nigga
Pin it on my Pendleton, trap late night, Jay Leno them
Got my mom a tennis bracelet, Wimbledon of Wilmington
Now, can I rap for a minute? Black on the track for a minute
Look in my rhyme book, see murder, like when I was a fan of No Limit
Ain't no gimmicks 'round here, this Compton, me, Doc and Kendrick
Chronic, good kid, my first—yeah, three documentaries
Now I'm blockin' sentries, 16 Impalas
They bounce like they Iguodala
That's on my mama, niggas up and did me a solid
I put that on me, that's on me
You get a bullet fuckin' with the lil' homie
Thinkin' back then like, ""Fuck your rules, nigga this is Piru""
Slide through with the Erykah Badu
West side Compton, nigga, don't mind if I do
From Piru Street to my old street
Nigga this Compton, grew up on a dead end
Got an armful of dead friends
Round here Crips be sweatin' us niggas like a headband
Like, ""What's up, cuz?"" (Yo dawg where you from?)
No time to stop and think
Pull your strap before they do or you get shot before you blink
Straight outta Compton, 3 times I told you
The third time I said it with TDE motherfucker
I'll make you eat every letter
Spoonfeed you niggas like toddlers, from the city of Impalas
When shot callers take their pitbulls and feed them niggas rottweilers
My clip full, I quick pull, no more slangin' 8 balls on the corner
And all them niggas I used to freestyle with, I ate y'all on the corner
Call the coroner, niggas dead out here
Hangin' onto life by a thread out here
Them niggas wearin' all that red out here
P snapbacks on niggas heads out here
So don't you come fuckin' with the little homie
So OG they call me Tony
Montana, no French, my red bandana legit
My uncle told me before he died, ""Just keep your hand on the brick"" (So I did)
Sell every chicken that a nigga had in stock, yes I did
Walked to Compton, hot pocket full of rocks, yes I did
Skipped class, yes I did, whooped niggas' ass, yes I did
Fucked a bitch behind the bleachers while on the rag, that's on Bloods
Westside, that's on Bloods, this TEC fly, that's on Bloods
You fuck with Dot, I'll let you choke on your blood
I put that—"
Dr. Dre	1	Bitches Ain’t Shit	The Chronic	1992	[Verse 1]	"I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tighter than a motherfucker with the gangster beats
And we was ballin' on the motherfuckin' Compton streets, peep
The shit got deep and it was on
Number one song after number one song
Long as my motherfuckin' pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hangin' with a white bitch, doin' the shit she do
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or two
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suin' 'cause shit that she be doin' ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she takin' me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize and pass to Daz"

For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese, I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof, vamoose, son of a bitch"

Blazin' y'all, and disappearin' in the fog
Or a mist, and chicks can't resist what I kick
They be beggin' for attention, or some more of the dillznick
Word up, baby, someone may have to get hurt up, baby
Shit is mad shady, but I got to get the gravy
Platinum respect like the force of a TEC
Keep you hittin' the deck, feelin' heat in your chest
Bangin' your thoughts with the hot onslaught
A kid got shot on the spot for goin' where he should not
Viciously, I make history instantly
Those other lame-ass loser-ass niggas, they can't fuck with me
I'm doin' my thing now to lamp later on
Paid in the shade with some fly gators on
But now I'm grimy as they get, mud on my pants and shirt
I bet you niggas out here know, I be puttin' in work"
2Pac	18	Can U Get Away	Me Against The World	1995	[Verse 3]	"I sit here reminiscin' and I hope you listenin'
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
‘Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home – that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to this sucker
‘Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya, but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows, on who controls will it last?
Before I ask, I hope you see that I'm sincere
And even if you stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up, ‘cause I believe in what we share
You're livin' in prison and what he's givin' can't compare
‘Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passionately yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me, can you get away?"

Feel like someone's readin' your horoscope (Ooh)
Some shit only me and the Lord knows (Ooh)
SOS is for those who hear this in morse code (Ooh)
Too many doors closed, cul-de-sacs and fork roads (Ooh)
Still ended up at the North Pole
This is where remorse goes (This is all)

Fighting over your deeds, sliding over your keys (Ooh)

Scarface	11	Heaven	The Fix	2002	[Verse 1]	"I know tomorrow ain't a promise, that's why I live one day at a time
So when it's my turn, there'll be no crying
I'm aware that when my number's called I'm punching the clock
No need for screaming at me momma, I'm out
And plus I wasn't really happy here to start with, let that be told
My own homeboy was robbing me, and that's 3 cold
I said '3', It's all intentional, cause 2 don't count
When your own blood is bitter and your homeboys bounce
Who the fuck is you gonna trust when your road dog is scheming?
And every other corner, you're passing a different demon
And now the clouds is open, I'm remembering this
Your family's your backbone, your friends ain't shit
Now I believe it when Rhonda was saying, ""Back in the days""
When our homeboys left, she the only ones stayed
For that very reason, I'm a try and give her the world
Found heaven in the form of a girl, everybody's saying"

I been in L.A. for a year now, so I don't see no seeds
After I'm done you: clappin' the crew
Hell yeah I fuck fans, guess what, your favorite rapper does too 
In a minute I'ma have the jeweler makin' my rims spin
My crew run wild like the Jamaicans in Kingston
Nuttin' but bling bling in your face boy; that's why my neck
Shine like one of the shirts that Puffy and Mase wore
I done found a nympho as soon as I pop her bra
She had my balls, head first like a soccer star
You can only stand next to the man if you proper
I take care of birds like an animal doctor
I been out and buzzin', niggas just slept on me
So I'm out for revenge like one of Bin Laden cousins, yeah!"
Eminem	15	Forgot About Dre	2001	1999	[Chorus]	"Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say

Rakim	10	Remember That	The 18th Letter	1997	[Verse 1]	"I get lost in the mind, come across the rhyme
Kick my feet up, then I find myself in time
I was on a train, destination Marley Marl's domain
I entertain, things'll never be the same
DJs will convey it if the label okay it
Teddy Ted and Special K was the first ones to play it
On the radio with the crazy flow
I pay dues until it pays me dough to do a show
When I'm at the helm, I cover the whole realm
In control and leave your soul overwhelmed
Under the influence of beats and instruments
Lyrics make it intricate and elements are tense
When you was playin' Pac-Man, it was the jams I packed
Peeps would swarm when I was performin', Black, I'm all that
Back before they turned hip-hop to rap
It always a place to party at, remember that?"
Guru	20	In Memory Of...	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 3]	"To all my brothers doin time, whether or not you did the crime
You know the system is devised to keep you deaf, dumb and blind
Like Scarface said, them cats are smart
In order for things to change we must all play a part
It's easy for us to blame society
But now it's way too late, and we must take responsibility
To all my brothers in the streets
I know you feel you gotta hustle cause your peeps gotta eat
Makin moves right and exact
Don't wanna see you layin flat, don't wanna see ya catch a bullet black
If we don't build we'll be destroyed
That's the challenge we face in this race of poor and unemployed
Freud, a philosopher, but I'm a realist
So philosophize this, without love we won't exist
To those who passed out there, in the deserts and the jungles
With pain on their shoulders, and heavy bundles
I pray each one will ascend to new heights and new enlightenment
And this is why I'm writin it
Yeah... this is in memory of"
Nas	9	Life Is What You Make It	I Am...	1999	[Verse 3]	"Make history before you go
Fuck the misery, you living po', we getting dough
Except the dollars other reasons why I'm living yo (why?)
Time is valuable
Low and behold, the young, black, and powerful
Got to eat yo, everyday my daughter feet grow
You actin' cheap with the dough, my heat could blow
Paying doctors when I'm born, a preacher if I'm buried
That's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit
Gotta pay just for living, tax life is a bid'ness
If you catch a bad deal, watch your life diminish
Deals made by God and the Devil, and we in it
Pawns in the game, can't complain or say shit
Just strap up and hold on, hope for the best
Prepare for the worst, no fears no nothing on earth
No tears if I'm dumped in a hearse, I won't be the first
Nor the last, nigga, let's get this cash, nigga"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Mural	Tetsuo & Youth	2015	[Verse 1]	"We're all chemicals, vitamins, and minerals
And vicodin with inner tubes wrapped around the arm
To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
Top Cat chat, let's begin another yarn
That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'?
But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy
So what powers cowards to get them to the top
Just to fall asleep listening to Bach?
The ribbon in the sky is the riddim that I drop
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading
They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?
And what's the talking without the match feeling
That's buried living
And cherry-picking every lemon from your berry system
Then proceed with the pack feeding
When I was young I had visions of another world
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother Hurl
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
I like my pancakes cut in swirls
Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons
Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms
Apologize for my weird mix
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips?
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks?
And smells like shotguns and deer piss?
They on their hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard
First part of a party, that I throw in parts
One minute you're playing pool, next minute you're throwing darts
But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars
I run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards
From Popular Mechanics to overdosing heart/hard
Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
Nerd gang, make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the wordplay ain't playing that the man's states
Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when demand brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weathermen
Or maybe weather woman
Whatever better to tell ya weather comin'
I prefer girls to reign all over the world
And not “rain” like “Rain Man” or rain like “rain dance”
Or rain like a “slight chance of rain” when it's rainin’
Or “rein” like deer slaves to Santa Claus; sleigh man
But “reign” like queens that reign over made man
And not “Queen” like “Queen Killer; Rhapsody Bohem’” Queen
But “queen” like white-glove-wave-hand
And not “wave hand,” like it's a heat
Wave, so you make a fan by waving your hand
I'm talking “wave,” like you saying, ""Hey, man!""
And not hay for horses or ""hoarsest"" like you almost voiceless
You gotta treat your vocal chords like it's a fortress
And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
And especially when you're recording
Cause that's the portion that's important
When I was reporting that I was poor, but now I'm more than
It's still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
Crying shames, make margarita rims from cheap tops
Deep plots, in floor to ceiling windows for my pee pots
A little scene, with the sickle swings, to make the wheat drop
And a hundred words, for them hummingbirds, that like to eavesdrop
And fan out like peacocks, with a parakeet that beat box
So the sun rise when the beat drop, and the sun dies when the beat stops...
Then it unties, then it relocks, then it relapse, then it detox
Then heat back like a heat pack on his knee caps of the weak spot
'Cause he want what we got, like yeah"

Kanye West	5	Pinocchio Story	808s & Heartbreak	2008	[Verse 1]	"It's so crazy, crazy-crazy
I got everything figured out
But for some reason, I can never find what real love is about
No doubt
Everything in the world figured out
But I can never seem to find what real love was about
Do you think I'd sacrifice real life
For all the fame and flashing lights?
Do you think I'd sacrifice a real life
For all the fame and flashing lights?
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
To get my heart out of this hell and my mind out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like? I ask you tonight
To live a real life"
Common	22	I Used to Love H.E.R.	Resurrection	1994	[Verse 2]	"Now, periodically, I would see
Ol' girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
She didn't have a body, but she started gettin' thick quick
Did a couple of videos, and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids, beads, medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin' the violence
About my people she was teachin' me, by not preachin' to me
But speakin' to me, in a method that was leisurely
So easily I approach
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast, and that was cool
'Cause around the same time, I went away to school
And I'm a man of expandin', so why should I stand in her way?
She probably get her money in L.A
And she did stud, she got big pub, but what was foul
She said that the pro-black was goin' out of style
She said, ""Afrocentricity was of the past""
So she got into R&B, hip-house, bass, and jazz
Now, black music is black music, and it's all good
I wasn't salty she was with the Boyz n the Hood
'Cause that was good for her, she was becomin' well-rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin' fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung"

Stages of battle field reveal your scars
Train hard, cause this is a game with ill squads
Play with pain and gain a couple of yards

I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill

As a better person; I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I 'posed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue
Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
And you ask: ""Lift up your shirt,"" because you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard 'em chatter: ""He's prob'ly young, but I know that he's down

Pacino life, G a roll, casino dice
At The Mirage, Vegas strip, neon lights
Gamblers, puffin' cigars, couples and stars
Flashin' cameras, dealers, shufflin' cards
Spent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd
'Cause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob
I never hang out, when we do we bust the .45
'Cause shells comin' back at us while we jump in the ride
Flyin', duckin', our bitches in the club cluckin'
Tellin' my wife who I was dancin' with like I was fuckin'
Flew back, Monday evenin'
From Nevada where the sun was beamin'
To the concrete jungle of cement
Limousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleepin'
Told my dogs ""Peace"", kept it movin', I was beat when
Got to my crib, where the hell my keys went?
Ringin' the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure
Dropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door
Slow music, H-Town, no, that's down low
My baby's drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around, yo
To the back, she must be inside and can't hear
Probably upstairs, in the mirror, doin' her hair
I walked in through the back door entrance
Shocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense
Chased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses
And lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas
A pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 Timberlands
Somethin' swingin' on the ceiling fan, I stopped it
Swingin' slower and slower
On the last swing, I saw it was a G-string and heard laughter
Thought about my nine-side Glock
But somethin' made me disregard it
Started my way up to where the noise and music was at
Froze, I couldn't react
Bedroom door opened a crack
Seen wifey layin' with some nigga mumblin' shit
He had one hand on her ass, and she was rubbin' his dick
Toastin' wine glasses, cherry-scented candles was lit
Couldn't handle the shit
Searchin' for words—I found none
Without a sound, I left the house with a sick smile and took my gun
Now I'm out buggin', whylin', what I'm gon' do?
Call my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm comin' through"

I feel like, one day, you'll understand me, dawg
You can still love your man and be manly, dawg
You ain't gotta get heated at every housewarmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Sheila always performin'?
Second she storm out, then he storm in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't letting everybody in our family business, uh"
Kendrick Lamar	16	HiiiPoWeR	Section.80	2011	[Verse 1]	"Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future, someone catch me
I'm falling victim to a revolutionary song, the Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slid you my disc
You wanted to diss, but jumped on my dick
Grown men never should bite their tongue
Unless you eatin' pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfuckin' pistol
Aimin' it at a pig, Charlotte's web is gonna miss you
My issue isn't televised and you ain't gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugarcoat it
You'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want a plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
While you motherfuckers waiting, I be off the slave ship
Building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs"
Big Boi	26	Peaches	Idlewild	2006	[Verse 1]	"I cram to understand why a woman and a man
Make a plan to enter matrimony then he takes her hand
Put that ring on her finger, couple of kids in minivans
Standin' in the stands like a fan, watch her little man
Run ball... and every time you see the family, they look happy
Got a mama and a daddy and I think they got a lil' dog
But daddy had a cat on the side
He would hide her from his ride, decide not to divide
Kept the yam in the hide, the spouse in the house
Boy, it's cheaper to keep her,  you fuck around and take a loss
Come up short like Short Dog, cuss words flow like
(Motherfucker, shit, goddamn asshole)
Took my shit (Bitch!) fuck!"
Big Pun	24	Super Lyrical	Capital Punishment	1998	[Chorus]	"Lyrically, I'm supposed to represent

Big Boi	26	E.T. (Extraterrestrial)	ATLiens	1996	[Verse 1]	"Peep what I say
Everyday the sun sets just like clockwork
To put the Glock to work
And putting bodies to standstills
Man it kills me
Taking that life is like taking a shit
Hit or miss, niggas are playing God
Trying to rob and steal
That's why ya gotta guard ya grill
Like a barbecue, 'cause them harming you
Are just like honeybees swarming you
Vocally arming you was my responsibility
It's killing me thinking that all these niggas see they flauging
Thinking they Steven Seagal and balling
Falling to the wayside when ya try to call, I've fallen
When we was little nappy headed niggas in the projects
But now they carjacks, wait on income tax and unsafe sex
Still yet they tend to flex, like solo for tha lo-lo
Smoke same thing, no-no, not this time
Niggas around my way can rhyme
So fuck that country shit, we done a bunch of shit
And yes, you heard of this
Out of this world like E.T
Coming across ya T.V
Extraterrestrial - straight from ATL
Knamsayin'?
Like that... yeah"
The Game	13	Compton	Doctor’s Advocate	2006	[Verse 2]	"Nigga I smoke chronic, ain't shit changed
Since Young MC and Eazy-E was rapping ""We All in the Same Gang""
Some niggas chain hang, other niggas gangbang
I do both cause I'm the king of the motherfucking West coast
Kick the door open, Will let's go
Flow like Esco', New York niggas say I'm the best yo
Hard like Timbos, blowing on indo
Niggas try to play me, get stretched out like a limo
I was chopping crack when Dre was banging my demo
And all you old niggas is washed up like N.O
Don't take it the wrong way, I got love for my kinfolk
Can I get a moment of silence, Will bang the instrumental
I spit for my niggas in the line-up
That'll never see the sun again, so I close my blinds up
First album sold them out, Impalas rolled them out
Cause the whole motherfucking world wanna know about"
Travis Scott	33	Impossible	Rodeo	2015	[Verse 2]	"Yeah, you the one, you know me the best
You the one I call when I'm stressed (This the time)
This the time of year when I'm alone
This the time of the year we get our own
I can't lie when I'm out on the west
Yeah, the west, yeah, yeah, the west side
And lately, I ain't been feeling the best
'Cause you the best, yeah, you my best side
Now you know what you're dealing with
Now you know what's wrong, what the feeling is
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Rastas rolling in Benz up in here
Bandits poppin' them bars up
Man, don't run up the bands up, make them gun claps in here
No fear, no fear, you rock, I hear
I'm gon' let you know that the man is for real
Yeah, for real
Far from here"

Eric B. & Rakim	14	I Know You Got Soul	Paid in Full	1987	[Verse 1]	"It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you
Without a strong rhyme to step to
Think of how many weak shows you slept through
Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you
Thinking of this, you keep repeating, you miss
The rhyme from the microphone soloist
So you sit by the radio, hand on the dial, soon
As you hear it, pump up the volume
Dance with the speaker 'til you hear it blow
Then plug in the headphone 'cause here it go
It's a four letter word when it's heard, it control
Your body to dance (You got it), soul
Di-tects the tempo like a red alert
Reaches your reflex, and let it work
When this is playing, you can't get stuck with
The steps, so get set and I'm a still come up with
A gift to be swift, follow the leader, the rhyme will go
Def with the record that was mixed a long time ago
It can be done, but only I can do it
For those that can't dance, then clap your hands to it
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines
I escape when I finish the rhyme, I got soul (Soul)"
50 Cent	19	Outta Control	The Massacre	2005	[Verse 2]	"System thumpin', dancefloor jumpin'
We 30 deep in this bitch, we stuntin'
That's what you get, you in my hood
I thought you understood, you know me
V.I.P., no I.D
Bottles of DP, I do it real B.I.G
Bitches break they neck to be where I be
Take 'em to ecstasy, wit out ecstasy
I'm a chef you need the hit I got the recipe
Doc got the antidote, it's in the drums and the notes
Can you feel it?
Em said for me to make you feel it
And remind you that you rockin' with the realest"
Future	30	That’s It	Pluto x Baby Pluto	2020	[Verse 1]	"Now that you got my attention, you 'bout to get put on suspension if I see the greed
Like I'm a part of the lynching, got twenty-one chains on my neck, had to go Dominique
Break the codeine and roll up a leaf, I fuck on his bitch, now she so bossy
Stella McCartney, I'm drippin' so nerdy, my fit was a birdie alone, that was it
Talk a few bales, oh yeah, that's it
Burnin' down Rodeo, oh yeah, that's it
I could put it on a scale, oh yeah, that's it
Ballin' in Chanel, like a player, that's it
Rainbow Rollie, oh no, that's it

Do it professional, girl, that's it
Treat me like a mayor, oh yeah, that's it"
Kanye West	5	Black Skinhead	Yeezus	2013	[Chorus]	"Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'

And you know it, and you know it"
Common	22	The 6th Sense	Like Water for Chocolate	2000	[Verse 3]	"Some days I take the L to gel with the real world
Got on at 87th, sat by this little girl
She recited raps, I forgot where they was from
In 'em, she was saying how she make brothers cum
I start thinking, how many souls hip-hop has affected
How many dead folks this art resurrected
How many nations this culture connected
Who am I to judge one's perspective?
Though some of that shit y'all bop to it, I ain't relating
If I don't like it, I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating
I just want to innovate and stimulate minds
Travel the world and penetrate the times
Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom
Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know I'm with 'em
For now I appreciate this moment in time
Ball players and actors be knowing my rhymes, it's like"
Lloyd Banks	34	My Buddy	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Verse 1]	"Everywhere I go, I gotta tag along
'Cause my buzz getting strong and they mad I'm on
He ride with me when I pass the mall
And wait for me on the bench when I run a game of basketball
One squeeze'll make a bastard fall, gasp and crawl
You need a bulletproof vest, mask and all
Bring your buddy when it's time to roam (Why?)
'Cause I got hit the last time I left mine at home
My hand bling full of platinum to shine his chrome
He even got closet space inside my home
He ain't never been broke, he glitchless
He's so reliable, I bought him a rubber coat for Christmas
Infrared beam and a scope for distance
The best company when approaching business
He gon' ride with me 'til the end
We all got a friend and mine is a G-U-N"

I'm bool like that, yeah I'm bool like that

'Cause I went to Compton High Crip School like that
I was Blood, and I ain't really like blue like that
They was Crippin, they ain't give a fuck who like that
Them niggas jumped me, why they have to do a 'Ru like that?

Diggy dope duck on the topic, so stop and give me my props, kid
I'm livin' large like a fat bitch
So get back, bitch, I'm hard to bogart so the fact is
This young black kid a mercenary, merciless
Murderin' millions of niggas, so who's first to diss?
They say I'm bad, so you'll find none worse than this
Chewin' motherfuckers up like a Hershey's Kiss
Put to sleep, lovin' the lyrics I leave in the minds of each
Rough when flex, too complex, wrecks your mental piece
So feel the wrath, nigga, I rip in half, niggas
You're quick to talk shit, I whoop your ass, nigga
Then watch me blast, nigga, 'cause I'm the last nigga
You wanna fuck with, so up your cash, nigga
I make 'em stagger, I'm scandalous as Jimmy Swaggart
I'm a good tracker, scopin' your girl then watch me tag her
Pullin' steel like a stunt
Shown like an ID card, nigga, no needs to front, so
Here to torment, I put track on crack
And I'm strapped with a semi-tone milli-ten MAC
Yo, I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, chief
Deadly as Jason on Friday the 13th"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Kick, Push	Lupe Fiasco’s Food & Liquor	2006	[Verse 1]	"First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss... (Ugh)
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air (Ugh)
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
Branded, since the first kickflip he landed, ugh (Woo)
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk; his neighbors couldn't stand it
So, he was banished to the park
Started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark, yeah
When they said ""It's getting late in here
So I'm sorry, young man, there's no skating here"""
Eric B. & Rakim	14	My Melody	Paid in Full	1986	[Verse 3]	"The rhyme is rugged, at the same time sharp
I can swing off anything, even a string of a harp
Just turn it on and start rocking, mind no introduction
'Til I finish dropping science, no interruption
When I approach, I exercise like a coach
Using a melody and add numerous notes
And with the mic and the R-A-K-I-M
It's attached, like a match, I will strike again
Rhymes are poetically kept and alphabetically stepped
Put in a order to proceed with the momentum, except
I say one rhyme out of order, a longer rhyme shorter
Or pause, but don't stop the tape recorder"
2Pac	18	I Don’t Give a Fuck	2Pacalypse Now	1991	[Verse 3]	"Walked in the store, what's everybody staring at?
They act like they never seen a motherfucker wearing black
Following a nigga and shit, ain't this a bitch?
All I wanted was some chips
I wanna take my business elsewhere, but where?
’Cause who in the hell cares
About a black man with a black need?
They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend
I wonder if he knows that my income
Is more than his pension, salary and then some
Your daughter is my number one fan
And your trife-ass wife wants a life with a black man
So who's the mack? In fact, who's the blackjack?
Sit back and get fat off the fat cat
While he thinks that he's gettin' over
I bust a move as smooth as Casanova
And count another quick mill'
I'm getting paid for my trade, but I'm still real
And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme
As strong as a fuckin' nine
Mail stacked up, niggas wanna act up
Let's put the gats up and throw your blacks up
But the cops getting dropped by the gunshot
Used to come but he's done, now we run the block
To my brothers, stay strong, keep your heads up
They know we fed up
But they just don't give a fuck
Yeah, they just don't give a fuck (I don't give a fuck either, man)"

And you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
It's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off
Knock on the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved
I'm no activist, I'm no Einstein
Before calculus, I was kicking that math
Dropping that science like an alchemist and I be kicking that ass
Lyrically, I'm UFC
If a UFO had came for me, I'ma come back with the head of an alien
Don't alienate my dreams
Get it right, get a life, I got two
That's a metaphor for the big shit I do
Boy, TMI, TSA, man, I'm fly

Like a pilot with a halo, woah

You're not extra extra, you're so plain Jane
The ying to my yang, darlin', you've got that thang
And you know it, but yet you don't
But yet you don't and that's what's so cool
You don't say too much, but when you do, it's profound
In the street, you hold your head high
At home, you get low down for me
(Can't get no lower, can't get no lower, can't get no lower, yeah)

When my ship is sinking, you won't let me drown, ah-ah-ah-ah

Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me through my diamonds when they glistenin'
Now pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim

Light of cities in the nights, destination for Kings

From Cuba, and pointed nukes toward the U.S
About to shoot us for revolution; that's how you gotta move
A lot of rules, some locked in solitude
Curse the day of they birth, confused, who's to be praised?
The mighty dollar -- or almighty Allah
I'm like the farmer, plantin' words, people are seeds
My truth is the soil; help you grow like trees
May the children come in all colors, change like leaves
Be hold before you one of those prophetic MCs
With blunted flows, seven hundred souls in me
Each channelin', from past to present times, heaven shines
Light on those, innocent to how the world grows
Some men become murderers, and some girls become hoes
And you accounted for, everything that you heard
Do not speak to fools; they scorn the wisdom of your words
My heart is wise, bloodshot eyes, the saga never dies
Ghetto prisoners rise, rise, rise"

Just remember when you do your thang
Make sure you do your thang on a hang
And everythang, is everythang
There ain't no mo' than this paper chase
Like them white-boy DA's was on tha case
You know I ain't tryin' ta floss, but uh

Prodigy	8	The Realest	Murda Muzik	1999	[Verse 3]	"Never prejudge, it be the humble that'll squeeze slugs
It be the ones standin' still that'll peel guns
Spill blood for my dunns thuggin' for me
Man, you don't wanna get involved fuckin' with P
I spent more nights illin', less nights chillin'
The more shots they hold, the better they feel it
What be the deal is? Some killers like to hide behind specs
Others got blatant disrespect, and the rest
Are so young that you wouldn't even expect
To be burstin' off guns like a Vietnam vet
On the steps, sittin' in the staircase bent
Thinkin' on ways to take another man head
Go to war with niggas that's against what I rep
I settle things with a heavy metal fifth
Change clips, switch clothes after I spit
Place niggas back in they space, fuck is on your mind, kid?"
50 Cent	19	Eye For Eye	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Verse 3]	"I got a handgun habit, nigga—front, I'll let you have it

I ain't a marksman; one spark and I spray shit
'Nough rounds from that H-K—I don't play, bitch (Uh-huh)
Move like I'm militant, back on that gorilla shit
Moody, disrespectful, unruly, but niggas can't move me (yeah)
I squeeze 'til I run out of ammo; if it's a problem, it's handled
I have your people pourin' out liquor and lightin' candles
You fuck around, I blow your brains on my New York Times
Run home, turn to the sports section and read your mind
It's crystal-clear, you should feel when that gat bust
First, there's crime scene tape, then you end up in that black hearse
We don't go to funerals, but we'll go to your wake, fam
View your body all banged up, you made a mistake, man"
Big Boi	26	BuggFace	Idlewild	2006	[Verse 1]	"What if everything you ever knew or known was lost?
The knees'll tend to freeze you when you gatherin yo' thoughts
You pause for the cause, try to recall and remember
But the train is in reverse and the caboose is in the center
Cause ya mind ain't free
Constricted by the muthafuckin boundaries, an ounce of weed
Or a pound of 'dro couldn't place you on the planet where I'm transmitting
Life from Bro, Bra, bruh, Brother, Bro-ham
Cadillac on vogues, strike a pose, then the door slam
Wham nigga, wham! Don't they say that in their show, dad?
Fo' sho' man, you acting like a tadpole out of gonads
You know OutKast the truth, hit the booth, be makin' more jams
Spreading strawberry preserves on ya nervous program

Hello? Is anybody home? Is anybody giving dome?
Serve me up, I want some"

Left me alone, I was grindin', I had to find myself
Real one, had to remind myself
Sometimes evеn rich niggas get lost
I'm experiеncin' more paranoia
Finding love got me more paranoid
I can't tell who real anymore
It's the ones that I cherish and adore
It'll never be like it was before
Before I was climbing up the charts
When you leaving, you leave me no choice
I'll come back and unpack the Rolls-Royce
I'll come through if you need me, of course
Hope it come to the day we rejoice
I got your back like a spine"
Jay-Z	12	Money Ain’t a Thang	Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life	1998	[Chorus]	"Bubble hard in the double R, flashin' the rings

Death didn't do us part, heart broke or no more marriage (Bitch!)
When it happens you'll be slappin' yourself rememberin'
You coulda remained boyfriend and girlfriend
Now you're sittin' in the courthouse, plaintiff and defendant (Bitch)
Pleadin' to the judge you was in it to win it
In the beginnin' was splendid, see, she was grinnin' and spendin'
All of her time with the kids, an' in the kitchen she'd cook
She was fierce on the stove, it was always great
Covered plates in the microwave when I came home late

Friction, wishin' I had paperwork on the misses, but I didn't
Damn... fuckin' around (Hey, baby)"

Cover your eyes I leave you face to face with your maker
The time taker intend your mind so now I break ya
No runnin' from it, you should've ran before I done it
Cause now I got this loaded twelve gage against your stomach
You scarred for life and your whole high life's invited
Burned alive its all for real so tonight I ignite
And leave you all face down to die
With no will to live I can see the fear in your eyes
No warning surprise nigga I come for taking
Your soul for Satan watching every move that your making
Your sure mistaken if you a ho before I turn out
Walking away I'll heat you up and leave you burnt out-nigga

Never let 'em be a threat, and your feelings you must protect 'em
As well as your rectum, must keep self out of harm
Out of danger's way, let strangers play while you graduate and move on
True happiness is not acquired and you won't find it for sale
Unless you're in jail and trying to get a bail bondsman to go on and post that bail
You would be happy as hell, you thought you was happy until that court date came
Couldn't abort that case, nobody to take your place
Family home is at stake, too late to escape and get on the run"
Gang Starr	21	She Knowz What She Wantz	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 3]	"Never fall victim to a chicken you was stickin

Never fall victim to a wicked woman's ways
""Why son?"" She's trying to get paid, check it
One: She said she wanted to give me a son
Two: She said she didn't like my crew
Three: She never ever cooked for me
Four: She was my cherie amour -- YEAH RIGHT
It was all hype, I needed more insight
In retrospect, I know I slept from the first night
She did a split and that was it
Gave up my pimp license, and flipped my whole friggin script
But now I'm back like the Isley's moving wisely
Sizing up the situation, keeping honies waiting
Cause I got more to do, than to be sucked dry
This tough guy, will get by, while the chickens wonder why
I don't be callin cause it's like Ex to Next kid
I know what I want, and just how to get it
Like her, no disrespect Miss"
Kendrick Lamar	16	The Blacker the Berry	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 2]	"I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing
That I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me, don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this Black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga"

We was hand in hand, Allstate

All shakes
Now it's fingers crossed over small stakes
No taller than the crawl space

We was bat, catcher, and pitcher, now you don't even wave
We used to throw the shaka, Honolulu from the stage

I got your head as a trophy up on the mantle
Each and every sect we wreck, the crowd's electrified
Mystified, you get dissed, when you try, you die
Fish niggas, they get fried up on my skillet
I kill it, fuck it, my shit is on hit
And hittin' you, blaow (Blaow), so what you wanna do now?
You stepped up, I whacked ya, you crept up, I smacked ya

You can't see what spot that the trap is in
(Hey bruh!) What's happening!
You had it mapped out, your plans get torn
You stayed up for days and now your dreams are gone
You said you quit, stated your word is bond
(Hey bro) what's going on?"
50 Cent	19	Gunz Come Out	The Massacre	2005	[Chorus]	"Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know what I'm 'bout)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know what I'm 'bout)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)

Kendrick Lamar	16	Mortal Man	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 1]	"Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily? Is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar?
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog?
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing
But a prophet ain't a prophet 'til they ask you this question:"
JAY-Z	6	Justify My Thug	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 3]	"They say an eye for an eye, we both lose our sight
And two wrongs don't make a right
But when you been wronged and you know all along that it's just one life
At what point does one fight? (Good question, right?)
'Fore you knock the war, try to put your dogs in his
Ten-and-a-halfs, for a minute-and-a-half
Bet that stops all the grinnin' and the laughs
When you play the game of life and the win ain't in the bag
When your options is none and the pen is all you have
Or the block, niggas standin' tight as lemons on the ave
Tryin' to cop a shop - call theyself cleansin' in the cash
But can't put they name on paper 'cause, then you on blast
Mr. President, there's drugs in our residence
Tell me what you want me to do, come break bread with us
Mr. Governor, I swear there's a cover up
Every other corner there's a liquor store, fuck is up?"
Kanye West	5	Paranoid	808s & Heartbreak	2008	[Verse 2]	"All of the time
You wanna complain about the nights alone
So now you're here with me, show some gratitude
Leave the attitude way back at home
Yeah, you see 'em look
Baby, let 'em look, give ya cold looks 'cause we look cold
Yeah, you heard about all the word of mouth
Don't worry 'bout what we can't control
All the talk in the world lost in the world
'Til you finally let that thing go
You wanna check into the heartbreak hotel
But sorry, we're closed"
50 Cent	19	Hustler’s Ambition	Get Rich Or Die Tryin’ Music From And Inspired By The Motion Picture	2005	[Chorus]	"I want the finer things in my life

Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)"
Kendrick Lamar	16	gloria	GNX	2024	[Verse 3]	"You were spontaneous, firecracker, plus our love is dangerous
Life of passion, laughin' at you lose your temper, slightly crashin'
Dumb enough to ill reaction, ain't no disrespect
Highly sensitive, possessed, saw potential, even when it's tragic
So jealous, hate it when I hit the club to get some bitches
Wrote 'em off, rather see me hit the church and get religious
Who you foolin'? I know what you doin', you my contradiction
'Member when you caught that body and still wiggled through that sentence?
Loved you more, when you flip and lose your shit, I hugged you more
It's sexy to me, cuss they ass out and hold that grudge some more
Down bitch, I know your favorite movie, is it Notebook?
So good, if they all sub me, get 'em all booked
My baby boo, you either heal niggas or you kill niggas
Both is true, it take some tough skin just to deal with you
Logical explanation don't exist, flippin' pages
Chapter after chapter, probably remarry and head to Vegas
Bitches gettin' marked out, they can't erase our history
They margins ain't big enough, they all led by bigotry
My woman and my right hand, my saint and my sin
Ain't no bitch like my bitch 'cause that bitch been my pen"
2Pac	18	Papa’z Song	Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...	1993	[Verse 1]	"Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight, so I pray, poor starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
The things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity
Moms always work, I barely see her
I'm startin' to get worried, without a pops, I'll grow to be her
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
So when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard God don't like ugly, well, take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him, they break up before the week ends
I'm gettin' sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it, he done split and the whole shit ends quick
How can I be a man if there's no role model?
I'm strivin' to save my soul, I stay cold drinkin' a forty bottle
I'm so sorry..."
Lloyd Banks	34	Betta Ask Somebody	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Verse 1]	"I come from a big city, the streets corrupt
Now I'm rollin' with snub-noses to heat you up
Out here niggas'll do anything to reach a buck
'Cause when you broke you can't afford to fuck ya sneakers up
I take my time, keep my mind on my bank funds
Learn how to separate the real from the fake ones
Hand on my heater Nina replica to carry on
My nigga just lost his momma, and his daddy gone
From now on I can provide 'cause my paper's straight
Family losin' it's legs, but I can take the weight
Some niggas hate but I'll be damned if they hold me down
Front niggas didn't know me then, bet they know me now
Blunt and a smile, eventually it'll be a frown
'Cause every time I turn around a nigga locked down
While I'm in the world, tryin' to bring my loot through
Hopin' one day we can kick it like we used to, my nigga"
OutKast	28	When I Look in Your Eyes	Idlewild	2006	[Verse 6]	"How can I let you down?
I guess I'm always gonna be around
I'm simply astounded

Havoc	7	Can’t Get Enough Of It	Hell On Earth	1996	[Verse 4]	"Ayo, we bang like the Tunnel and jam like broke gats
One hundred and oh, nigga, go check the stats
QB, yeah the name hold weight and ring bells
All you niggas shook and it ain't hard to tell
Major clientele, the infamous cartel
Catch a buck-fifty, them stars, we scar well
Hard luck, got gassed up and starstruck
Then got stuck in one stroke, the Mobb clutch
Laid up, sippin' all types of shit, get ya chick bent
Talk the bitch to death 'til there's no info left
Homicidal clepto, like the lye leaf, I'm petrol
Regulate the Metropolitan, niggas gettin' bodied in
In the lobby, and lock the door, it ain't safe, kid
Take it how you take it, grab a hold and embrace it"
Big Pun	24	I’m Not a Player	Capital Punishment	1997	[Verse 2]	"I bang a stranger in my torture chamber
Feed the locas chocha pinga while I force my finger where my bolas linger
I Bring the Pain like Method when I flex and flip the coochie
Puerto Rican to the core, but no Boriquas eat the pussy
'Scuse me for bein' blunt, but I've been eatin' cunts
Since pimps was pushin' pink Caddies with the fish tank pumps
Bumpin' and grindin', simultaneously grindin'
Climbin' up the walls, with my balls bangin' off your hymen
I'm a diamond in the rough, (ugh) bustin' in your face
Taste the sweetness of my dick, rip your fetus out of place
Yo, bitches already know the repertoire
Step in my car, let's start the ménage à trois, like Escobar
By far, I'm the best at all sex positions, forget the kissin'
I'm skippin' the tongue-twistin', TS Tradition"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Streets on Fire	Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool	2007	[Verse 2]	"""Believe!"", so say the neon signs by the
Loudspeakers repeating that everything is fine;
A subtle solace to demolish the troubled conscience
Of a populace with no knowledge and every freedom denied
Every dream is designed and broadcasted
From the masters to the masses
From the antennas on the top of the shrines
Refine the receiver and plant it
During the panic and short it, it reports back
Everything in your mind, everything is lying
Everything is dying, everything is a rule
Everything is a crime, everything was here then
Everything rewind the new
Weather burned the feathers off everything flying
(And she likes it, and she loves it)
The sadness, the madness, the bad shit
The lavish, the fastest, the clashes, the ashes to ashes
Everything intertwined
My femme fatale my darling fraudulent angel
Once caught her changing the batteries in her halo
Receipt for her wings and everything that she paid for
And the address to the factory where they made those
Scientist said she's all inside my mind
The little boy said ""What happened to all the girls?""
The preacher man said ""She's going to kill off your soul.""
The dope boy said ""It's the whole wide world."""
Kanye West	5	Can’t Tell Me Nothing	Graduation	2007	[Verse 1]	"I had a dream I could buy my way to Heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested, guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosbys, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from"
Kanye West	5	Welcome To Heartbreak	808s & Heartbreak	2008	[Verse 1]	"My friend showed me pictures of his kids

And all I got was a brand new sports car, oh"
Common	22	Testify	Be	2005	[Verse 2]	"Fear in her chest, her face with tears
Had her man's back, he was facing years
In her name, though the place was his

For years she been through scuffle and fights
While he tryna hustle that white
Up all night wondering if he's alive
Seeing him tried, she bubbled inside and screamed"

Smoke that ass like a loosie, though I need to quit
Fuck it, I love it
Like a cloud over the projects, your game, I'm above it
It's combat, gats, bangers and all that
You's a small cat, whatever you on, get off that
I mention nothin' but the real shit, presentin'
The hollow-tip crew, 41st side convention
Stride full, you half-steppin'
Like a fresh TEC out of the box, yo, niggas, I'm testin'
That's no question, bitch-ass, have you confessin'
Like a DT, left in state of depression
You under pressure, in tag, no doubt catcher
The snitch-snatcher, shooken with asthma, you Casper
You yell my name, that's only givin' me props
Plus the fans that you got wonderin' what's got you hot
It's Tu-Not, knocked out the box and got rocked
Got raped on the Island, you officially got
Kick that thug shit, Vibe magazine on some love shit
Keep it real, kid, 'cause you don't know who you fuckin' with"

Shootin the breeze, with a cute Vietnamese
Or was she Lebanese? I think she Chinese
It really don't matter cause they all on they knees
It's somethin bout these motherfuckin West coast G's
Make that cheese, when the cops come you bet' not freeze
Blast on 'em like the Genovese, they yo' enemies
Lock you up and fuck you up
Talk shit to you beat you down then cuff you up
And leave you in a cell stuck (damn!)
I ain't got no money for bail, that's real as fuck (f'real)

Chill, catch a plane to Spain or maybe Brazil
On the real can you feel me?"

Get my drink on, then get on the dance floor
Look homie, I don't dance, all I do is this
It's the same two-step wit a lil twist
Listen, pimpin', I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
Pay attention, boy, I'll teach you how to do this shit
You mix a little Cris' with a little Dom Perignon

Detox, rehab, cold sweats, watch them shake
I'm not that genie in a bottle, I'm in a bag
Take one hit and slide off to the Land of H, man
When we first met, I thought you'd never doubt me
Now, you tryna leave me, you never live without me
Girl, I'm missing you, come and see me soon
Tie your arm up, put that lighter under that spoon
Now, put that needle to your arm princess, stick it in, relapse
I'm back, bitch—don't ever try that again
All the shit I did for you, I made you feel good
We have a love thing, you treatin' this like it's just a fling
What we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring
You broke my heart, you dirty bitch, I won't forget what you did
If you give birth, I'll already be in love with your kids
Listen, I don't give a damn if your ass starts smokin'
But we have a bond that is not to be broken"
Prodigy	8	Where Ya Heart At	Murda Muzik	1999	[Verse 1]	"Ayo, it's Hell on Earth, down here the pavement scorching
It's molten rock when the Mobb walks in
Shit gets hot like a ill pot of grits spilled on you
Spit fire with nines but never squealed on you
I understood, you should try to take my life
If I was you I would too, damn right
If I had drama with a nigga like such as myself
I couldn't even sleep at night until I made things right
Pull out guns, exchange a fight
Be the first to let off mines, ignite the pipes
And never let the daylight decieve
During the sun's hours niggas do bleed
Aim for the waist and something on the top gets shot
Niggas can't shoot, never made a thing drop
Keep cream of the crop, fresh out of box shit filled to the top
Smell the barrell when it's bolt-locked, nigga"
Eminem	15	97' Bonnie & Clyde	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Chorus]	"Just the two of us, just the two of us

You'll never be enough, let's just keep it real, JAY-Z
Fuck JAY-Z, I mean, you shot your own brother
How can we know if we can trust JAY-Z?
And you know better, nigga, I know you do
But you gotta do better, boy, you owe it to Blue
You had no father, you had the armor
But you got a daughter, gotta get softer
Die JAY-Z, this ain't back in the days
You don't need an alibi, JAY-Z
Cry JAY-Z, we know the pain is real
But you can't heal what you never reveal
What's up, JAY-Z? You know you owe the truth
To all the youth that fell in love with JAY-Z
You got people you love you sold drugs to
You got high on the life, that shit drugged you
You walkin' around like you invincible
You dropped outta school, you lost your principles
I know people backstab you, I felt bad too
But this 'fuck everybody' attitude ain't natural
But you ain't a saint, this ain't kumbaye
But you got hurt because you did cool by 'Ye
You gave him twenty million without blinkin'
He gave you twenty minutes on stage, fuck was he thinkin'?
""Fuck wrong with everybody?"" is what you sayin'
But if everybody's crazy, you're the one that's insane
Crazy how life works
You got a knot in your chest, imagine how a knife hurts
You stabbed Un over some records
Your excuse was ""He was talkin' too reckless!""
Let go your ego over your right shoulder
Your left is sayin', ""Finish your breakfast!""
You egged Solange on
Knowin' all along, all you had to say you was wrong
You almost went Eric Benét
Let the baddest girl in the world get away
I don't even know what else to say
Nigga, never go Eric Benét!
I don't even know what you woulda done
In the future other niggas playin' football with your son
You woulda lost it
13 bottles of Ace of Spade, what it did to Boston
Nah, JAY-Z
Bye, JAY-Z"

Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault them, 'cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light, but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort, I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest and hurt you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the Most High
Regardless of what happen, on Him let's rely"

Now shorty mama in precinct, hollerin' rape
I'm convinced, man, somethin' really wrong with these hoes
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fuckin' with her nose
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD, it didn't have no beats (Huh-uh)

Streets gave me all I write in this song
Hootie babysitted, changed my diapers
Gil introduced me to the game that changed my life up
East Trenton grew me, had me skipping school
Valencia's boyfriend Volvo had me making moves
Mama raised me, pop, I miss you
God, help me forgive him, I got some issues
Mickey cleaned my ears, Annie shampooed my hair
Eric was fly, shit, I used to steal his gear
I was the baby boy, I could do no wrong
Years going past fast, let's move along
Kitchen table, that's where I honed my skills
Jaz made me believe this shit was real
Labels turned me down, couldn't foresee
Clark sought me out, Dame believed
Primo laced me, Ski did too
Reasonable Doubt, classic, shoulda went triple
Mama loved me, pop left me
Grandma dressed me, plus, she fed me
Banana pudding was in the hood then
Puffing on L's, drinking pink Champale

Tone, Mike 'Zo and them niggas, V.A.'s locked
Biggs fucked with a nigga, what's up, Hoff?
Bee-High hated the fact I put rap to the back
Money pouring in, clientele growing now
Birth of my first nephew, time to slow it down
October 21st, Lavelle came to the world
Followed by three more boys and then a baby girl
Mama loved me, Ti-Ti, Uncle Jay
Loves you to death, won't let no trouble come your way
Oh, can't forget my man down in Maryland
He's gone 'til November, how can I not remember?
Tell your moms I'm there for her and Tiembra
And your son, too, it's nothing I won't do
Unless you was me, how could you judge me?
I was brought up in pain, y'all can't touch me
Police pursued me, chased, cuffed, and subdued me
Talked to me rudely 'cause I'm young, rich, and I'm Black and living a movie, not living by rules
New rap patrolling the city, follow my crews
Bleek, you're still with me, nigga, what did I say?
Your time is coming, you one hit away
Beans, I ain't tryna change you, just give you some game
To make the transition from the street to the fame
My mama loves me"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Compton	good kid, m.A.A.d city	2012	[Verse 1]	"Now everybody serenade the new faith of Kendrick Lamar
This is King Kendrick Lamar
King Kendrick and I meant it, my point intended is raw
Fix your lenses forensics would've told you Kendrick had killed it
Pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
And I mastered being the master at dodging your honor
And the chapter that read at 25 I would live dormant like five in the morning
They raid your spot while Kendrick's performing
And if they take everything, know I got"
Eminem	15	Lose Yourself	8 Mile	2002	[Verse 1]	"His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him"
50 Cent	19	I Don’t Need ’Em	The Massacre	2005	[Verse 2]	"Niggas be talkin 'bout me, they always callin' me crazy
Fuck them OG niggas, they stuck in the 80's
Sayin they gon' do me somethin', now you know that's a lie
Nigga you look at me wrong I let the hammer fly
I'm rich, I still wake up, with crime on my mind
Queens nigga put it down like Pappy Mason in his prime
When I say move, nigga move, or get caught in the crossfire
I prevents runnin', cut my fuckin' hand on the barbed wire, shit's crazy
Just a different day it's the same shit
Hollow-tip partin' yo' head, leave your whole fuckin' brain split
They sick, they see me in that Aston Martin
What's the matter? They can't get that hooptie started
Thought they was grindin', well God damn, where that money at?
Thought you was fucked up, cause you was lettin' paper stack
You ain't a hustler, matter fact, you's a buster
I don't trust ya, I should send niggas to touch ya"
JAY-Z	6	Cashmere Thoughts	Reasonable Doubt	1996	[Verse 1]	"Uhh, I talk jewels and spit diamonds: all cherry
Like a hymen, when I'm rhyming with remarkable timing
Caviar and silk dreams, my voice is linen
Spitting venom up in the minds of young women
Mink thoughts to think thoughts type similar
Might you remember, my shit is cold like December
Smoother than Persian rugs, the cashmere
Chromosomes make a nigga Jigga - Jay-Z, lethal drugs
18-carat gold pen, when it hits the sheets
Words worth a million like I'm rapping them through platinum teeth
I got the Grey Poupon, you been warned
'Cause all beef return well done filet mignon
The Don, smell of Dom on my breath as I
Yawn, (slow) when you hoes try to con a pro
As if you didn't know, Jay's about getting dough
Spitting flow like fine wine down your earlobe
I'm smooth but deadly like a pearl handled pistol
Honeys hum in melody when I rub it like crystal
The proper etiquette when I drop the subject verb
Then the predicate with this rich nigga rhetoric
I'm solid gold, I rap like a mink stole
I stick pearl tongues your world'll never know
From New York to Paris, the vocal style vary
From nice to deadly like a bad bag of D, now
Notice the child swift like a Lotus
Focus on the loc', I be the greatest nigga that wrote it
Return of the Jedi from Rio De Janeiro on the red eye
Yet I still feel the need to be fly
I did die when I'm rapping then slide like satin
You know the black I white china in the brain cabinet
I never cry if I did I'd cry ice
From my nigga Sauce, I hit you with this advice
Life's short, so play hard and stick hard
And the only time you love them is when your dick hard"
2Pac	18	Bomb First (My Second Reply)	The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory	1996	[Chorus 2]	"We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die

We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die

Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first"
50 Cent	19	Places to Go	8 Mile	2002	[Bridge]	"If there's a genie in a bottle of that Dom Perignon

MC Ren	17	Compton’s N The House (Remix)	Straight Outta Compton	1988	[Verse 4]	"Speaking of Compton, it's making me sickEverybody's talking that crazy shit(Uh-huh)Poppin' that shit, get the fuck out my face
Knowin' that they never even seen the place
Claiming my city, it's my city they claim
Muthafucka, we're about to put some salt in your game"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	No Competition	Follow the Leader	1988	[Verse 2]	"Competition is none
I'm the sole survivor, emcees get live but I get liver
It ain't a Memorex, live in concert
In every network, the R's the expert
Whoever goes against causes friction
Introduction, music, where's the mixing
Ra will never die, soon they'll never try
To beat or defeat me because whenever I
Put poetry in motion
From the Nile, then out to the ocean
Three-fourths of water makes seven seas
A third of land, 360 degrees
I circulate and remain to rotate
Seven days a week at a quick or a slow rate
Be prepared whenever I come"
Future	30	Like That	WE DON’T TRUST YOU	2024	[Chorus]	"Young dope dealer, sellin' dope, is you like that? (If you like that, )
Kickin' doors, kickin' in doors, is you like that? (, yeah)
Young throwed nigga, sellin' loads, is you like that? (, yeah)
All '24, you on go, is you like that? (If you like that)
Niggas from the bottom really like that (If you like that)
Steppin' in Balencis if you like that (If you like that)
Pop another bottle if you like that (If you like that)"
Daz Dillinger	2	Ridin’, Slipin’ & Slidin’	Dogg Food	1995	[Verse 1]	"It's a brand new day in the hood
It's money to make, and I'm doin' bad, and it ain't lookin' good
It's all about the you-know-what everywhere that I roll
And never leave empty-handed without packin' my chrome
If it's on, it's on — I put down my gangsta hand
Show and provin' began, put the jack down to chance
See, I can put down like this, and you don't know why
Niggas always would try, but soon they all just die
How they come up like I, would put my biz in the street
I'd like to say is that the jack made my life complete
Fifty-four thousand — the cash, eleven G's the stash
But it still ain't enough, so what can I plot next?
An armored truck would be fine, as I come up from behind
Grab seven bags and fled, not wastin' no time
Coppers tailin' my ass, breathin' hard down my back
Now my biz in the corner as I aband' the 'Llac
Grab the satchel full of money, back to Style crib
I throw the money on the table, say ""We back in biz""
I caught the biggest dope sack, I got my hood sewed up
Now everybody 'bout to make the bomb soaked uncut"
Big Boi	26	We Luv Deez Hoez	Stankonia	2000	[Verse 1]	"Don't lie you love them
If you don't you like them hoes a whole lot
Just like your mama Sunday cookin', turkey necks in the pot
You ready to drop your load like prop planes, be dumpin' that cocaine
You ready to turn your 'fro, from natural straight to a cold wave
Dat ho name Betty Big Shoez, she wore them Herman Munster heels
Popped a pill, now she's in your Coupe De Ville, passenger seat
I made her eat my meat while I was rubbin' her coochie
Injection in her top and bottom lip straight from her booty
So Do Re, blow me, Fa So La Ti Da Ha I'm tellin' the truth
You suckin' your tooth you treatin' her like a star boy
From a Figueroa to a Herringbone
From droppin' her off to takin' her home
She tried to pull my rubber off with her pussy muscles that was wrong
The bitch is no good like lesbians with no tongues
You fucked around and knocked her up and now you say she the one
Nigga you dumb, you should have pulled it out and squirted on her eyelash
And let her face be holdin' the baby, now she after yo ass!
Yeah, I told y'all niggas
About god damn takin' them hoez to the Cheesecake Factory
Lettin' them hoez order strawberry lemonade and popcorn shrimps
They ain't goin' do nuthin'
But try to get all your motherfuckin' cheese! (Yeah!)"
Common	22	Nag Champa (Afrodisiac for the World)	Like Water for Chocolate	2000	[Verse 3]	"Women cry, children laugh, men dance
I refuse to lose self and try to win fans
Over, weight on my shoulder fluctuates like Oprah's
My refrigerator poetry's magnetic like ultra
You couldn't hang if you was a poster
Posing like a bitch for exposure
It's rumors of gay MCs, just don't come around me with it
You still rockin hickies, don't let me find out he did it
Got my eyes on the tiger, eyes on the prize
Eyes on the thighs, of Mary J. Blige
Imagining how good the cat must be
Stop eatin meat, lost weight, but I still rap husky
My verse depth, is that of a baby's first step
Or the old lady who died and the nurse wept
I flow like cursive writing, inviting you and yours to my openess
Shows allow me to cop range like a vocalist
But man does not live on bread alone
What good is a range when it's time to head home?"
Kendrick Lamar	16	luther	GNX	2024	[Verse 3]	"I can't lie
I trust you, I love you, I won't waste your time
I turn it off just so I can turn you on
I'ma make you say it loud
I'm not even trippin', I won't stress you out
I might even settle down for you, I'ma show you I'm a pro
I'ma take my time and turn it off
Just so I can turn you on, baby
Weekends, get it poppin' on the low
Better days comin' for sure"
Jay-Z	12	Money Ain’t a Thang	Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life	1998	[Chorus]	"Bubble hard in the double R, flashing the rings
With the window cracked, holla back, money ain't a thangPut it down hard for my dogs that's locked in the bing (Uh-huh)
When you hit the bricks, new whips, money ain't a thang (C'mon)"
Lloyd Banks	34	I Smell Pussy	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Verse 1]	"It's not of my nature to make a commitment, so let me breathe
What she doesn't understand, catch attitudes when I leave her
Prior relations just make it harder for me to accept her as my own
She tries to tie up my phone
If I'm not at home, she's thinking I'm not alone
Probably out trying to bone anything in the street
I let her know she can leave I ain't trying to tie her up
But see it's hard to fuck with somebody after she touches me
Mami I'm not your regular nigga I know the game
But I don't play by the rules I'm focusing on my moves
That way I will never lose
See, I can tell by your shoes if you attracted to Benzes with 22s
You say I confuse you, play little tricks with your head
Been catching feelings ever since the first time I slept in your bed
Hun, I'm not here to tease you, mislead you, or sell you dreams
I can't say I love you I don't know what that means
I'm a PIMP!"
Dr. Dre	1	Alwayz Into Somethin’	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Verse 1]	"And so on, let the shit flow on
Because I need somethin' to go off on
The motherfuckin' D-R-E servin' a death wish
So I'ma hit you like this
Early in the morning, hop into the B-en-Z
I got 44 ways of gettin' paid
Sittin' in my lap as I roll off the Compton blocks
To scoop up Ren, I heard shots
One, two, three, then I seen a nigga
Hoppin' the fence and it was Ren on the motherfuckin' trigger
He got in the Benz and said
""Dre, I was speakin' to yo' bitch O'Shea”
And as we roll on, I seen the patrol on creep
So we got ghost before they peeped
Me and Ren in a black CE, yo
Bumpin' some funky shit by The D.O.C
(""No one can do it better"")
I gotta get paid, paid in a hurry, see
I got a habit if I'm not paid thoroughly
I start takin', makin' sure my shit is steady bumpin'
A nigga always into somethin'"
Kanye West	5	Bound 2	Yeezus	2013	[Verse 1]	"What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21, but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walk-around-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane around, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom shit

Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch"

You wanna ball 'till you fall, I can help you with that
You want beef? I could let a slug melt in your hat
'Cause I'm a wild barbarian, too hard, I'm scaring 'em
Century 21 solar eclipse
While you listening to the words that I wrote on the disc
Thelonius, my description is doo-rags, pants sag down to my feet
AK is my heat, everyday in the street 'til I lay six feet
QB, PJs, and we playing for keeps
Jewelry, cars and Jeeps is my motto
Four-fives with the hollows, silencers on the nozzles
Pop bottles with those who left here
The best years, wearing a bulletproof vest years
The aim for the head and chest years
What's your name? Make your name known
For the next year's, better rep, yeah"
OutKast	28	The Rooster	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse 2]	"Round two, a single parent, what is Big to do?
Throw a party? Not hardly; I'm tryin' to stay up outta that womb
Or that p-u-s-s, puss, I said puss
Luther Vandross couldn't make a home out of this house that we smooshed
Smashed, pushed to the limit, smash and turned it timid
If anyone was suffering, the house was feeling wicked
The cat got sold, the dog got old, the food got cold
Both of our tempers were on swole
For the most, most part, you fuss, fight, fart
You build it up to break it down and now take it from the start
Repeatedly leading a path that only ends in a clash
Of two stubborn minds, grown folks blind to the signs"

Keep an eye out for the devils 'cause they itchin' to get you
Merciless madman, screamin' kamikaze in tongue
Automatic gunfire, makin' all my enemies run
Who should I call when I'm shot and bleedin'?
Indeed a possibility that's part of chasin' cream
Dope got me hatin' fiends
Scheme with my team, just a chosen few
My foes victim of explosives, come closer exhale the fumes
We got memories, fadin' fast
A slave for cash accelerate, mash, blast, then dash
Don't look now! How you like it, raw?
Niggas ain't ready for the wrath of the Outlawz
Never surrender, death before dishonor, stay free
I'm thugged out, fuck the world 'cause this is how they made me
Scarred but still breathin' believe in me
And you could see the victory, a warrior in jewels, will you picture me?
Life of an outlaw"

I'ma keep it pimpin' on some rich shit
We can do the show on the jet lift
Fuckin' in the air on the jet, bitch
We can do the helicopter cruisin' over Vegas
Hundred thousand dollars for a watch, countin' fetti
Kiss on a nigga with his chains on, glisten
Fuck so good, got both of us dizzy
Do it lowkey, profile, get busy
Do it lowkey, profile, gettin' busy
Got the Audemars Piguet on fleek
Got my number one freak in the sheets

In Hell's Kitchen, I chef the impossible
To serve hot plates all across the Unified States
Sit down and sup with the top rap reps
We the streets that's watchin', boy, move diligent
You better walk like a nigga on a tightrope do
Infamous first infantry, first division, fourth mission
First assignment — give 'em that shit they been missin'
My new edition's way bitchin'
Those that listen get addicted to my diction
Fuck rhymes, I write prescriptions for your disease
Generic raps just not potent like P's
One-thousand-one-hundred CC's on the throttle
I peel off, chest naked on Katanas
Spaghetti head Mobb niggas is full bred
Fully-blown melanin tone
I rock skeleton bone shirts and verses
But thirst for worse beats
So I can put more product out on the street
Get respect and love all across the board
We've been adored for keepin' it raw
Nothin' less or more, I score every time for sure
While the rest of y'all niggas just nil"

So, I make a skit just for kicks
Syncopated, coursing through
Innovated because the flow
Melodic and melodramatic styles occur
Like a choreographer, my mind's a photographer
Makin' music visible for the individual that gets visual
What I manifest you express on the dance floor
Pants get torn when the jam is on
'Cause I kick rhymes until the rhymes kick back
It's hard to kick that, where did you get that?
Here's the concept, part of your concert
Expect the expert to perfect and do work
Don't stop the song 'til I'm gone
Keep gettin' it on, kick it off with the horns
Kick along"

Just, so I could meet a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothin' but homies around, so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes, hah
But I'm from Tha Pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a ho? 'Cause a ho's a trick
I don't love them tricks 'cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
Turnin' them trick-ass hoes the fuck out now"

Cuz these fools on the street tryin to take mine
Wassup ladie
Times gettin shady
You gotta lipstick wit it
Thats why I'm sick wit it
Hard to maintain in this world of pain
But I'mma serve these rhymes like dimes of caine (check it out)
Why can't we just chill and get along, motherfucker?
But the views you choose to use is wrong, motherfucker
Relax, me and Baby S got it macked to the tee
Just ride with me
Battlecat in the back with a sack on deez
Ridin' with the young OG's (OG's)

When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walking with a snub, cause niggas do a lot of slick talkin
In the club 'til they coughin on the rug
Ain't never had much but a Walkman and a bud
My role model is gone snortin up his drug
Bad enough they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat
Now it's an RIP shirt in my coat
Now I'm speedin, reminiscin
Holdin my weed in, never listen
If I see him I'mma lift 'em
And maybe that'll even the score
But if not, it'll be me on the floor"

So like Nino in ""New Jack,"" I holla ""Cancel that bitch!""
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggas around me so cold, man my heart done froze
I built an empire on the low, the NARC's don't know
I'm the weatherman, I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the do'
O after O, you know?

You see 'em back in the hood, it's 'cause I see they're fake
I preach a sermon 'bout the paper like I'm Creflo Dollar
I pop you punk niggas like I pop my collar
I'm confused, I like Megan, Monica and Mýa
Missy's freaky and Brandy's shy, uh
Now take a look at how my lifestyle changed up
I'm on now, God damnit, I done came up
Now you can find me with the finest hoes
Choosin' which whip to drive by what match my clothes
I got a fetish for the stones, I'm heavy on the ice man
If I ain't got a pistol on me, sure I got a knife fam

The Game	13	One Night	Doctor’s Advocate	2006	[Verse 3]	"This shit worse than arguing with my bitch
I done been through mo' ups and downs, than the Impala switch
Get yo hand out my pocket nigga, go fish
I was born by myself so I don't owe y'all shit
Nigga you tell me, what you want me to do
Drop my son off at home and come bang wit'chu?
Oh now it's fuck Game, nah nigga fuck you
I put that on my life, matter fact, that's on Piru
And the reality is, I could die too
And end up in the cemetery, right beside you, we can both rot
Angels flying over my headstone, but the devils inside yo' box
You wanted my shine so I gave you ice
Then I gave you a second chance and you played me twice
Couldn't be a real homeboy to save yo' life
I shoulda took Dr. Dre's advice"
OutKast	28	A Life in the Day of Benjamin André (Incomplete)	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse]	"I met you in a club in Atlanta, Georgia
Said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album
You looked at me like, ""Yeah, nigga, right""
But you gave me your number anyway, you were on the talcum
Powder—how's about them oranges?
Moved away from home to school with big plans
By day, studied the history of music
By night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance
To get your pants was a Mission Impo–ssible
We were both the same age, but I
Suppose, wasn't on the same page, but in
The same book of life, so I'd page you when
I felt that you were getting off of work
Or either when you're on your way to school
We started hanging like Ernie and Bert
And in my idle head, I'm thinking, ""Cool""
Just when I think I'm going down your shirt
You're hiking up your skirt now
The events that followed had me volley
If your hometown would be Heaven or Hell
The angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best
Therefore, hard to tell
You'd drop me off by the Dungeon
Never came in, but I knew that you were wondering
""Now, are these niggas in this house up to something?
Selling crack, sack by sack, so they could function?""
W-W-Well, yes and no
Yes, we were selling it, but no, it wasn't blow
Cook it in the basement, then move it at a show
Then grab the microphone, and everybody yelled, ""Ho!""
Meanwhile, the video starts playing
BET, college radio, and a van
Packed full of niggas with a blunt in their hand
And one in they ear—you know what I'm saying, but
I kept your number in my old phone
Got a new chip-flip with the roam-roam
So it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits
But I promised I would call you when I got home, but
When I got home, I never did
By the time I did, heard that you'd had a kid
By some nigga in Decatur who replied, ""See you later""
When he got the good news—that's life, shit
Now, I'm nineteen with a Cadillac
My nigga had a Lex with the gold pack
Got a plaque, but I'm living with my Pop-Pop
So I got a Glock and a LoJack
Yeah, kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw
And never said much, 'cause half of what he saw
Was so far from that place you wanna be
That words only fucked it up more; follow me
Are you starting to gather what I'm getting at?
Now if I'm losing you, tell me, then I'll double back
But keep in mind: At the time, ""Keep it real"" was the phrase
Silly when said now, but those were the days
When Spring Break and Daytona
And Freakniks made you wanna
Drop out of college and never go back
Move to the South, but that ain't a Kodak
Moment; on went myself and Big Bo—
Well, you knew him as ""'Twan""
That's right—you were around before this shit begun
Well 'Twan had a daughter and
Sorta was made to mature before the first tour
We hit the road like Jack
Laughed and cried and drive it back with some 'gnac
Girls used to say, ""y'all talk funny - y'all from the islands?""
And I'd laugh, and they'd just keep smiling
""No, I'm from Atlanta, baby; he from Savannah—maybe
We should hook up and get tore up and then lay down; hey, we
Gotta go because the bus is pulling out in thirty minutes""
She's playing tennis, disturbing the tenants
Fifteen-love, fit like glove
Description is like fifteen doves
In a jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost
Making one woozy in the head and comatose—agree?
Enough about me—how's about you? How's the lil' kid?
She was about two the last time we spoke
I hadn't smoked or took a shot of drank
'Cause I'd start the second album off on another note; now—
That note threw some niggas in the hood off
But see, I'd balled out, and 'fore I'd fall out
I'd slow my Lac down to a nice speed
The brain was that fried egg, I might need
New direction was apparent
I was a child looking at the floor, staring
So changing my style was like relief for the primitive beast
Yes, I was on the rise, yeast was the street
To make bread, never primary concern
Just to hop on these beats and wait my turn
I'd meet Muslims, gangstas, bitches, rastas
And macaroni niggas: ""impastas""
So, on a trip to New York on some beeswax
I get invited to a club where emcees at
And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head
Similar to the turban that I covered up my dreads with
Which I was rocking at the time
When I was going through them phases trying to find
Anything that seemed real in the world
Still searching, but I started liking this girl
Now, you know her as Erykah ""On & On"" Badu
Call Tyrone on the phone, ""Why you—
Do that girl like that, boy? You ought to be ashamed""
The song wasn't about me, and that ain't my name
Were young, in love; in short, we had fun
No regrets, no abortion, had a son
By the name of ""Seven""
And he's five; by the time I do this mix, he'll probably be six
You do the 'rithmetic, me do the language arts
Y'all stand against the wall blindfolded; we throw the darts
To poke you in the heart and take you from the start
To when ""luxury transportation"" meant a MARTA card
Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays' mama
Or her daddy let her borrow the Benz, because she smart
Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor
And he sells you that Rabbit that's been sitting in his yard
You fix it up, you trick it out
You give it rims, you give it bump
You give it all your time because that's all you can think about
And that's as far as I got
(*music fades*)"

Niggas threw two at me, I threw four back, hold that

Motherfuckers wanna test that, stress that
And right where you're stressed at, where you rest at

Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bougie, he big-headed

It's bad enough I gots to deal with all these pressures that stand
You tryin' to make me stray away from my plan
Know what I'm sayin'?
I'm from the gutter, where all we had was one another
No wheat bread to butter, from one bed to the other
All uncles and no brother
My mother's at work
My grandfather was my dad
And when he died it hurt
And as I hold back the tears my eye-wells swell
I been praying for heaven, I been living in hell
And these niggas in my age group is dead or either locked up
The bitches no better, they smoked out or knocked up
But I still love my hood, that's where it started
Ain't no hard feelings, we partners nigga, regardless
That's why you always see me coming around
Cause I could never turn my back on my town

And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran' keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The Devil is alive, I feel him breathin'
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down

His job try to claim that he too niggerish now

Big Pun, the Honorable, all rise
Sky's the limit, nothin' less if my guys is in it
For the right price, even Christ could get it
Fast life we live it, all my memories are vivid
I remember only minutes, that's how I mentally get rid of all the enemies
The spirits that definitely mimic my every melody
And lyric which so heavenly rhythmic
In magic do I build, but math do be equally compatible

I see the beast when the dead die, relief when my head’s high
Hear the streets up ahead cry, when the heat from the lead fly
Felt the grief when I said bye, 'fore the sheets on my bed dried
The turn of the table, the tale of the tape
The destruction of human flesh of the not so great
The long list of the John Doe’s that accompany the spirit
As the yells of the souls lost with hopes that god hears it
The resurrections of empty hearts crowd in the room
Muffled sounds of the outside echo the tomb, but I’m cool, I’m cool

We got evicted, had to leave the 'burbs
Back in the ghetto, doin' wild shit
Lookin' at the sun don't pay
Criminal mind all the time, wait for Judgment Day
They say Moses split the Red Sea
I split the blunt and rolled a fat one up, deadly
Babylon beware, comin' for the Pharoah's kids
Retaliation, makin' legends off the shit we did
Still bullshittin', niggas in Jerusalem waitin' for signs
God comin', she's just takin' her time (Haha!)
Livin' by the Nile, while the water flow

What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver
Durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me
I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan, my pops left me
And often my mama wasn't home
Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
Big, I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight"

Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doing, just make it count (I need some water)
Wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you

Rakim	10	Microphone Fiend	Follow the Leader	1988	[Verse]	"I was a fiend before I became a teen
I melted microphones instead of cones of ice cream
Music orientated so when hip-hop was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated
'Cause I grabbed the mic and try to say, ""Yes, y'all""
They tried to take it and say that I'm too small
Cool 'cause I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug then I jet (Then I jet)
Back to the lab without a mic to grab
So then I add all the rhymes I had
One after the other one, then I make another one
To this the opposite then ask if the brother's done
I get a cravin' like I fiend for nicotine
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm ragin', rippin' up the stage and
Don't it sound amazin'?
'Cause every rhyme is made and thought of
'Cause it's sort of an addiction
Magnetized by the mixing
Vocals, vocabulary, your verses, you're stuck in
The mic is a Drano, volcanoes eruptin'
Rhymes overflowin', gradually growin'
Everything is written in the cold, so it can coincide ('Cide)
My thoughts to guide
Forty-eight tracks to slide
The invincible, microphone fiend, Rakim (Rakim)
Spread the word 'cause I'm in
E-F-F-E-C-T
A smooth operator operating correctly
But back to the problem, I got a habit
You can't solve it, silly rabbit
The prescription is a hyper tone that's thorough when
I fiend for a microphone like heroin (Heroin)
Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix
Give me a stage and a mic and a mix
And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of
Unawareness, beware, it's the re-animator (Re-animator)
A menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon
An assassinator, if the people ain't steppin'
You'll see a part of me that you never seen
When I'm fiendin' for a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend
After twelve, I'm worse than a gremlin
Feed me hip-hop and I start tremblin' (Tremblin')
The thrill of suspense is intense, you're horrified
But this ain't the cinemas of 'Tales From the Darkside'
By any means necessary, this is what has to be done
Make way 'cause here I come
My DJ cuts material (Material)
Grand imperial
It's a must that I bust any mic you hand to me
It's inherited, it runs in the family
I wrote the rhyme that broke the bull's back
If that don't slow 'em up, I carry a full pack
Now I don't wanna have to let off, you should've kept off
You didn't keep the stage warm, step off (Step off)
Ladies and gentleman, you're about to see
A pastime hobby about to be
Taken to the maximum, I can't relax, see
I'm hype as a hypochondriac 'cause the rap be one
Hell of a antidote, somethin' you can't smoke
More than dope, you're tryin' to move away but you can't, you're broke
More than cracked up, you should've backed up
For those that act up, need to be more than smacked up
Any entertainer, I got a torture chamber
One-on-one and I'm the remainder (Remainder)
So close your eyes and hold your breath (Breath)
And I'ma hit you with the blow of death (Death)
Before you go, you'll remember you seen
The fiend of a microphone, I'm the microphone fiend (I'm the microphone fiend)"

Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
I'm only eighteen, so I'm a young buck
It's a riot, if I don't scrap, I'm gettin' stuck
But that's the life of a G, I guess
Eses way deep, shanked two in the chest
Best run 'cause brothers is droppin' quicker
Uh, too late, damn, down goes another nigga
Bouncin' off the walls, throwing them dunks
Gettin' that rep as a young hog
It ain't nothin' like the street life
You better be strapped with your shank, 'cause ain't no fist fight
So I guess I gots to handle mine
Since I did the crime, I gots to do my time"
Eminem	15	I Will	Music to Be Murdered By	2020	[Chorus]	"I thought I heard a voice in my head that said ""Kill""

My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will

They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, ""Chill

You can miss me, I'm probably chillin up in Mississippi
Or Poughkeepsie or Baton Rouge guzzlin whiskey
I'm a walkin franchise and I wanna get paid
Get dropped, mopped and stomped like a parade
Persuasion, phase three of the invasion
I gots to break loose cause I'm feelin caged in
Loose in the jungle, blaze a botanical garden up

Before I go, I shoot it out with the cops
Hit one for Sean Bell then bleed on the block, yeah
Like Big did, I play with toys like a big kid
Got a snub nose, call it Big Tig
You art not fuck with Game, he crazy
And the bars comin' straight outta Compton, baby
My 16's mean, you know what I mean
Headed to the airport, my flow flying in from Queens
Accompanied by my bitch, flying in with them things
My shorty is a 10, that's that singing nigga, Dream
The life of gangsta in Cali is too short
So I might as well find me a borough in New York"
Dr. Dre	1	Housewife	Tha Streetz Iz a Mutha	1999	[Chorus]	"Now this, this is one of them occasions
Where the homies not doin' it right
I mean he found him a ho that he like
But you can't make a ho a housewife
And when it all boils down you gonna find in the end
A bitch is a bitch, but a Dogg is a man's best friend
So what? You found you a ho that you like
But you can't make a ho a housewife (Wife)"

Kendrick Lamar	16	LUST.	DAMN.	2017	[Verse 2]	"I wake in the morning, my head spinning from the last night
Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap, then do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it—
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passing, things change
Reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	As the Rhyme Goes On	Paid in Full	1987	[Verse]	"Knowledge will begin until I finish this song
'Cause the rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme goes on
You sweat as you step, about to get hype
Or should you just listen to the man on the mic
You're physically in this with me, but how could you tell
If it's meant to be hip-hop if you're not mentally as well
Ready to absorb the rhyme that I just poured
Into the mic, so unite and this won't be so bored
If you just keep kickin', listen to the mix
And think you'll sink into the rhyme like quicksand
Holds and controls you 'til I leave
You fall deeper in the style, it's hard to breathe
The only time I stop is when somebody drop and then
Bring 'em to the front 'cause my rhyme's the oxygen
Then wave your hand, when you're ready I'll send you
Into your favorite dance, but let the rhyme continue
And so on, and I'ma go on simultaneously
And even if I stop, the rhyme remains to be
Rising to the top and I came to drop it
Catch it and quiz it is my topic
Universal 'cause I move everybody to come
By exercising your mind, you'll coincide as one
Then look around and see how packed the party starts to get
I draw a crowd like an architect
The five boroughs react and all the islands attract
And every state can't wait, so they attack
Off a spot on the floor, squeeze in 'cause it's packed
It'll be more room if MCs play the back
I'm the R, the A to the K-I-M
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
The microphone fiend if I was a fake
Whoever said it's just buggin' off the rhymes I make
I had you biting your tongue for what I brung and recite
Sung it on stage, some said it don't sound like
The voice on the record, I see what you mean
Because the system was wack, so I had to scream
So just give me a mic, if it's loud, I'll blow it
If not, into the crowd I'll throw it
Pull out my cordless mic then entertain you well
Before I let go, I'ma spark your brain cell
I took time to write, tonight I will recite
So poetically inclined when the mic is held tight
Rhymes start flowin', kisses are blowin'
MCs are knowin', that's why they're goin'
Home to tell a friend when the party end
""Yo, man, you know Rakim? That brother struck again""
'Cause mic by mic and stage by stage
Tape by tape and page by page
When the crowd is moving, I compete with the mix
The rougher the cuts, the rougher the rhyme gets
Deeper and deeper, I hope you understand it
I made it up myself and I planned it
For other MCs who waste time (Pump it up, homeboy)
Writing jokes, riddles, and maybe a rhyme
I cross my arms and I was waiting, but I was hating
The rappers on the microphone was fronting, just faking
They wasn't breakin', which means I was achin'
To get up on the microphone and then start takin'
Control of the mic, uptight when I grabbed it
So hug the speaker, your ear's a magnet
Attracted to a freestyle put in effect
You listen to the man while you're sippin' Moet
So Eric, pick up the needle (Yeah) put it in the middle (Alright)
Give me a scratch, turn my mic up a little
I want you to hear this perfectly clear
Catch what I'm sayin'? You get the idea?
I hope you 'knowledge the beginning 'cause I'm finished, this song
The rhyme gets rougher as the rhyme flows on"

To let you know that you're not alone"
Rakim	10	Guess Who’s Back	The 18th Letter	1997	[Verse 1]	"It's the return of the Wild Style fashionist
Smashin' hits, make it hard to adapt to this
Put pizzazz and jazz in this, and cash in this
Mastered this, flash this and make 'em clap to this
DJ's throw on cuts and obey the crowd
Just pump the volume up and play it loud
Hip-hop's embedded, before I said I wouldn't let it
But me and the microphone is still magnetic
Straight off the top, I knew I'd be forced to rock
Dance floors just stop, the spot's scorchin' hot
Hopin' I'll open Rakim Allah seminars
Massage at the bar, smokin' ten dollar cigars
While I admire MIDI, with more vision than TV's
I find it easy catchin' diabetes from fly sweeties
Sit back and wait to hear a slammin' track
Rockin' jams, by popular demand, I'm back"
The Game	13	Dollar and a Dream	The Documentary 2	2015	[Chorus]	"Started with a dollar and a dream and a pistol (dollar and a dream)
On the corner rag hangin', slangin' crystal (dollar and a dream)
I said you gangbanging let me see credentials
And when I pull this gun out you know how this go
Started with a dollar and a dream! (Look at me now)
(Look at me now, then one day)
Started with a dollar and a dream!
(Dream, and this is what I deserve)"
Snoop Dogg	0	Institutionalized	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Outro]	"And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood
But you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous
Fuck you, goodnight, thank you much for your service"
Rakim	10	It’s the R	The Master	1999	[Verse 3]	"From the inner city to the suburbs, the street poet
The most jiggiest kid with words, and peeps know it
They've read about it and heard, plus TV show it
So how do I reserve my swerve? I low pro it
Now there eager to know just how deep the flow get
I don't know yet, sometime the flow be so wet
Spit a tech that will effect quicker than Moet
Or high as anything you smoke yet, go ahead roll it
Any microphone I hold, my heat blow it
My M.O. is make more dough till I can't fold it
Anything I see or touch, I wanna own it
Drop a jewel in baby girl ear, now she my co-ed
I re-load and she keep the candy coated
And when she know she can't control it
She tell me she about to blow at any moment
Well go ahead baby I can't hold it (I'm comin')"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Father Time	Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers	2022	[Verse 2]	"I got daddy issues, that's on me
Lookin' for, ""I love you"", rarely empathizin' for my relief
A child that grew accustomed, jumping up when I scraped my knee
'Cause if I cried about it, he'd surely tell me not to be weak
Daddy issues, hid my emotions, never expressed myself
Men should never show feelings, being sensitive never helped
His momma died, I asked him why he goin' back to work so soon?
His first reply was, ""Son, that's life, and bills got no silver spoon""
Daddy issues, fuck everybody, go get your money, son
Protect yourself, trust nobody, only your momma'n'em
This made relationships seem cloudy, never attached to none
So if you took some likings around me, I might reject the love
Daddy issues kept me competitive, that's a fact, nigga
I don't give a fuck what's the narrative, I am that nigga
When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused
Guess I'm not mature as I think, got some healin' to do
Egotistic, zero-given fucks and to be specific
Need assistance with the way I was brought up
What's the difference when your heart is made of stone
And your mind is made of gold
And your tongue is made of sword, but it may weaken your soul?
My niggas ain't got no daddy, grow up overcompensatin'
Learn shit 'bout bein' a man and disguise it as bein' gangsta
I love my father for tellin' me to take off the gloves
'Cause everything he didn't want was everything I was
And to my partners that figured it out without a father
I salute you, may your blessings be neutral to your toddlers
It's crucial, they can't stop us if we see the mistakes
'Til then, let's give the women a break, grown men with daddy issues"
Nas	9	U Wanna Be Me	8 Mile	2002	[Verse 1]	"Now slowly, thinking of all the things that oppose me
I think of kings who died and rappers out to dethrone me
For they crown they head is cut off, bodies is laid
Dead in the street, it's so fucking pitiful
First they love you, could be the bitch that even live with you (ho)
Mad at your riches, now she switched, turned miserable
'Cause she wanna dress like Bonnie, Robin and Crystal do
But Crystal's single, Bonnie's broke and her niggas too (ha)
I can do bad by myself; went from rags to wealth
From Jags to Bentleys to, plenty ass bitches
Can't keep they hands to theyself no more
I'm like, Hugh Hefner, you lesser, you just a"

The Game	13	LAX Files	LAX	2008	[Verse 1]	"Come to my hood hood, look at my block block
That's that project building, yeah that's where I got shot, shot
'Cause I was more hood than Suge, had more rocks than Jay
More scars on my face than the original Scarface, or the homeboy Scarface
Al Pacino couldn't be no gangsta, DeNiro in ""Casino"" he no gangsta
Wanna be, wanna see, wan' get a shovel
Dig Tookie up nigga, cause he know gangstas
Niggas think cause they watched ""Menace"" a couple times
Seen Cube in ""Boyz N the Hood"" and pressed rewind
That you could survive when a real Crip
Run up on your car and flex the nine
You must be out of yo' mind, a real Blood'll put you out of yo' mind
Just stay the fuck up outta my hood
Where my niggas take you up outta yo' shine
It ain't a movie dawg, hell yeah this a real fuckin uzi dawg
I'm 'bout to hop inside my Impala, try to keep up, don't lose me y'all"
André 3000	27	Spaghetti Junction	Stankonia	2000	[Verse 1]	"Niggas elope wit ski slopes and fall like avalanches
Tootin' like it's cool: he's a fool, and I can't just
Sit around and watch those nose membranes flame
My ends is loose and you can't stop that rain
When it starts to fall
Black man, white man, Jew man, ain't no joke
Remember me and my cousin used to sit up on the porch
And talk about when we get older; now we up against the ropes
Yeah, they kickin' niggas door down, 'cause it ain't no dope on the streets"
Common	22	Resurrection	Resurrection	1994	[Verse 2]	"I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light
I use insight to enlight then write some shit that's skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe, imagination's in flight
I send light, like Ben's kite, I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights and in fights I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like, I spend nights up in dykes
In spite, I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
(Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo) I got it made
I bathe in bass lines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums
Had to halt with the, malt liquor
'Cause off the malt liquor, I fought niggas
Now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruise the Southside streets with no heat and no sticker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
UAC got my back and we don't, now check it
I'm a ho but not a ho nigga, ain't scared of no nigga

Know wha'mean, Hav? Situation like this
Another war story from a thirsty young hustler
Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya
And leave your corpse for the cops to discover
While I be pimpin' in the Range Rover, all jewelled like Liberace
You watch me while Jakes tryna knock me and lock me
But I be on the low sippin' Asti Spumante
Niggas tried to creep on the side of my Jeep
Stuck the heat through the window, rocked they ass to sleep
Over a 3-pack — it was a small thing really, yeah
But keep lettin' them small things slide and be a failure
If I'm outta town, one of my crew'll take care of ya
The world is ours, and your team's inferior
You wanna bust caps? I get all up in your area
Kidnap your children, make the situation scarier
Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile, but ain't a damn thing funny
I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
Plus, the outcome turns out to be lovely
Got cheese in my pocket, hit off my main squeeze
Push back the sunroof, let the cold air breeze
Through the butter-soft leather upholstery
But mostly, keep the gat closely 'cause niggas wanna toast me"

All these people I had to leave in limbo
I'm back now, I've come to release this info
I'll be brief, and let me just keep shit simple
Canibitch don't want no beef with Slim, no
Not even on my radar
So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off?
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos
From séance to séance, aw-a-aw-a-a-aw-a-aw"
Eminem	15	Rock Bottom	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Chorus]	"That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal

'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal

Real G's who drop ki's

Rakim	10	When I’m Flowin	The 18th Letter	1997	[Verse 3]	"Two pages cause panic, freestyles is frantic
Thoughts is organic, flow is aerodynamic
Mic is volcanic, rhymes spread across the planet
I send out the scribe now the vibes gigantic
Now, I'm internationally known, mental capacities blown
I hope your microphone's accident prone
Raw footage is shown, but only showin scenes of my own
Leavin your periphereal vision in a zone
But not the twilight, from the insight that I write
And recite, in my mic'll be bright, cause I like
The night glowin, it's out of sight when I'm showin
Man I keep it goin, damn I keep it flowin"

Eric B. & Rakim	14	My Melody	Paid in Full	1986	[Verse 5]	"Marley Marl synthesized it, I memorized it
Eric B. made a cut and advertised it
My melody's created for emcees in the place
They try to listen 'cause I'm dissin' them, so pick up your face
You broke your neck as you try to detect my pace
Now you're druggin', almost buggin' off my rhyme, like bass
The melody that I'm styling, smooth as a violin
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island
My wisdom is swift, no matter if
My momentum is slow, emcees still stand stiff
I'm genuine like leather, inclined to be clever
You say you beat the R, I'll say, ""Oh, never""
So Eric B. cut it easily and
Check out my melody"

She got on Payless, me? I got on gator shoes
I'm shoppin' for chinchillas, in the summer they cheaper
Man, this ho, you can have her when I'm done, I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin' know
This ain't no secret, you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose on me, I'll have you strippin' in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
'Cause I need four TVs and AMGs for the six
Ho, make a pimp rich, I ain't payin', bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit (Trick)"

Stay strapped with a Mac, I was into all of that
I started rappin' and got nice as hell
If it wasn't for this, I might be doin' life in jail
And some of my peeps are still in the game selling 'caine
If that's what you gotta do to maintain, go 'head and do your thang
But with the cash profit, make an investment
And try not to go to the grave like the rest went
'Cause you can be rich with crazy loot, own a house and nine cars
What good is that if you're dead or behind bars?
Ayo, it's not even funny
I've seen a lot of my peers give up their careers for some fast money
They could've been boxers, ballplayers or rap singers
Instead they bank robbers and crack slingers
Ayo, they used to be legit kids, now they corrupt
They had dreams, but gave 'em up, 'cause they're street struck"

Fought that, not guilty, I'm back, niggas hate me
Been there, done that, sold crack, got jacked
Got shot, came back, jumped on Dre's back

I'm on the edge, I'm just waiting on a nigga to push me
Put my hand on my strap—what you looking at, pussy?
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends

Remember the first nigga to run is the first to get shot
Whoever said that what I say and portray is negativity
Need to come kick it in the city with me
And find the black and crack the fact
And take that shit back
'Cause they don't wanna fuck with that
There's too many niggas they're trying to calm
If motherfuckers could get it, nobody would've fucked with it
Appetite for Destruction
For him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit
Murder in the first degree and manslaughter
Taking the life of his wife and young daughter
A whole city of bitches that look sucked up
And the niggas is killing, it's straight fucked up
Whoever saying what I'm saying's for greed
Then I ain't even what they're trying to feed
My appetite for destruction"

Jay-Z	12	Nigga What, Nigga Who (Originator ’99)	Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life	1999	[Verse 2]	"Got a condo with nothin' but condoms in it
The same place where the rhymes invented
So all I do is rap and sex—imagine how I stroke
See how I was flowin' on my last cassette?
Rapid-fire like I'm blastin' a TEC, never jam though
Never get hot, never run out of ammo
Niggas hatin' and shit 'cause I slayed your bitch
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick, and now you
Actin' raw, but you never had war
Don't know how to carry your ho, wanna marry your ho
Now she's mad at me 'cause Your Majesty
Just happened to be a pimp—what a tragedy!
She want us to end 'cause I fucked her friend
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again
I seen her tears as she busted in
I said, ""Shit, there's a draft, shut the door, bitch, and come on in!"""
Nas	9	Big Things	I Am...	1999	[Chorus]	"Nah, I ain't fuckin' with you

She ain't takin', I want it, but yo I know she waitin'
I throw the bait in, and before you know we datin'
I want the format, to the doormat
Contacts, fast callbacks and all that
Your deepest ecstasy suit your rare accessory
Your secret recipes to your bear necessities
She real exotic, body feel like Lucile Roberts
Name-brand closets, culturized products
Claws like a scorpion caught me in deeper
But juice sweeter, enough to buy a two seater
Every mile I plan to have your mind beguiled
'Til it informs me more than you would normally allow
Raised more than a eyebrow with a flagrant style
By now I can taste your smile, stay awhile"
Gang Starr	21	Comin’ for Datazz	Hard to Earn	1994	[Verse 2]	"Who's that lurkin' in the dark with the hoodie strapped
Puffin' on a blizz, mellow meditatin', black?

Sometimes I wanna flip, clap a hole in they chest
But I lay back as I prepare for the payback
And drop the master rhymes with the mad crew from way back
I stay back, I watch, the whole job, you botched
Couldn't maintain, it's like your brain just stopped
But the Gang is on the prowl, kid, like Lecter
Paint a logo with your blood so you niggas remember
The Chain and the Star, mystical and never typical
The average rap group ain't even equipped to go
Head up, I'm dead up, you ducks could never last
You fakin' jacks, we comin' for that ass"
JAY-Z	6	Song Cry	The Blueprint	2002	[Verse 1]	"Good dude, I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We shoulda been together havin' Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first-class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view 'cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
We're somewhere in a small town
Somewhere lockin' a mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside, a nigga so sick"

To flow, and I go through extremes don't intervene
My adventures show like a three dimensional screen
Cause I mention many things and I'm presentin many scenes
Guess I'm telegraphic, motions energentic
Better tell em forget it, cause I'm telekinetic
Crowds is screamin, I choke the mic and keep squeezin
Styles seemin like I used a thousand words without breathin
Bustin techs like Russian Roulette I doubt you win
Freestyles like hand grenades without the pin
Composin, then leave the mic full of corrosion
Don’t test this, or catch the asbestos exposure
At shows I spit flows with seven deadly venoms
Killin syllables with poisonous synonyms in em
Ideas is blowin, mics is blowin
From what I'm showin, see it, I keep it goin when I'm flowin"

See I got the foreign cars, my niggas got foreigns and you know they is not holdin' shit
See me pullin' up, that boy got a foreign and you know that bitch got the ownership
And if I'm in the passenger seat, you know that I got a thirty clip
And look at these niggas, they actin' like gangsters, but they really just on some phony shit
See, I been in the field for a long time
Bad bitches try to fuck on me, I remember when they ain't pay me no mind
I remember when these boys tried to take me off my grind
I remember when these boys said that I would be nothin'
I remember when I had no money and I needed a lil' frontin'
I remember before hundred percent, my boys got the work, had to cut it
I remember I started runnin' this shit, you know I'm gonna keep runnin' it

Wonderin' how we bubblin', hustlin', breakin' days in
Grimy motherfuckers, gettin' info from your baby's mother
Got her pillow talking while that ass is sleepwalking
So all that bullshit you did, I know where you live
You better be on point when you walk in the rest
Your broke ass probably don't got a vest

Ain't no tellin' when the bullet's behind the trigger

You wouldn't survive, nigga, if I chose you
Froze you from ear to ear, showin' your whole vocal
Who told you, you could roll through?
My lyrics practically rose you from the grave like The Crows do

Very ugly from the face up, leave you laced up

She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her 'cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
An hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar, tryna get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryna holler 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryna holler 'cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed

Sometimes I don't even wanna be a Piru
Then I think about it like, fuck everything blue
Who killed my motherfuckin' brother?
()
Who killed G man too? The shit I seen men do
If I told you, I'd have me floating in some cement shoes
See Compton ain't shit really
And I’ve been at the bottom of the pits, feel me?
I done had some real niggas try to kill me
Fake niggas in my crew
Crip niggas more loyal than a few of my Piru
I done been shot, had a surgery or two
Above the rim like Pac, I’m like birdie at the troops
And I can’t lie, every time I see Suge my heart beat
Cause I don’t know if I should dap him or let the hawk speak

And who gon’ take it from me?"

Hoes'll get you sidetracked, then clapped from close feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days
A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away
My pain, wish it was quick to see
From sellin' 'caine 'til brains was fried to a fricassee
Can't lie, at the time it never bothered me
At the bar, gettin' my thug on properly
My squad and me lack of respect for authority
Laughin' hard, happy to be escapin' poverty, however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks
Expectation for dips, for precipitation we stack chips, hardly
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in
No more Big Willie, my game has grown
Prefer you call me William
Illin' for revenues, Rayful Edmond-like
Channel 7 News, round seven jewels, head dead in the mic
Forgettin' all I ever knew, convenient amnesia
""I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure.""
Lock my body, can't trap my mind
Easily explain why we adapt to crime
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant, that's how we on it
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speakin' in codes since I sense you peekin'
The NSX rental, don't be fooled, my game is mental
We both out of town, dog, what you tryin' to get into?
Viva Las Vegas, see ya later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no Fraud Willies present gamblin' they re-up
And we can have a pleasant time, sippin' margaritas"

My lil' hoodrat, baby got that mini MAC
Baby got that twenty sack, baby got plenty that
Whatever you send us, my nucca, we gon' send it back
I'm in the club with the snub, gettin' love
With twenty thousand Crips and twenty thousand Bloods
And we don't give a fuck about none of y'all
And when you hit the city, you better holla' at the Bigg Dogg
I done seen niggas hit L.A. and get they chain snatched
Then they call me up beggin' me to get they chain back
What I look like, the motherfuckin' police?
There's certain rules you got to follow when you in these streets

Wearin' the virus, Acquired Immune Deficiency
Dishin' his dick in every thick promiscuous fish in the sea
Listen to me, shit is rough in the ghetto
You bluff, blow your head off, fuck a snuff, we bust lead off
Get off your high horse or die off like an extinction
Boriquans are like Mohicans, The Last of the Po'Ricans
We need some unity, fuck all the Jeeps and jewelry
The maturity, keeps me six feet, above obscurity
The streets are deadly and everybody's a desperado
I guess tomorrow ain't promised unless you're Amish and death's your motto
Like Zorro, I mark my territory with a symbol
Not with a Z, but a P, 'cause Punishment's what I resemble

Dark blocks, with streets lamps shot the fuck out
Park benches is broke, a nigga stretched out
Jumped off the roof and fell to his death, it's real
Hand Ball walls displayed with R-I-P murals
Those who sling, play the shadows by the building
Devil's Spring, keep 'em going while the snows blowing
Grams get dipped, 50's is moked, cookies is broke
And Spliced in large pieces for the fiends to smoke
The sun set looks beautiful over the projects
What a shame, its ain't the same where we stand at

Sometimes niggas miss when they lick off, don't get clipped off

Eminem	15	Stay Wide Awake	Relapse	2009	[Verse 2]	"So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's makin' me play hide-and-seek like Jason, I'm so hungry
She's naked, see, no privacy, but I can see she wants me
So patient, see, I try to be, but gee, why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep and I creep right through the front, see
So blatantly, but silently 'cause I know that she's sound 'sleep
""Who's wakin' me so violently, and why's he on top of me?
He's rapin' me,"" she tries to scream, ""Somebody please get him off me
He's tapin' me, he's bitin' me, he's laughing like it's funny""
She's scrapin' me, she's fightin' me, she's scratching like some dumb freak
Escapin' me, no dice, ya see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan, gee, what a sight to see, I'm dancin' in my red panties
I'm crazy, but it's alright with me, man, life can be so empty
Stay away from me 'cause I'm dancin' to quite a different drum beat"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Real	Lupe Fiasco’s Food & Liquor	2006	[Chorus]	"The game is not to give 'em nothing real
Real, real, real, real
Nothing that they could use, nothing that they could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
Give 'em a bunch of lies and teach 'em that it's real
Real, real, real, real
So that's all they'll know, that's all that they'll feel
Feel, feel, feel"
Lloyd Banks	34	Get Low (Alternate version)	Get Rich Or Die Tryin’ Music From And Inspired By The Motion Picture	2005	[Chorus]	"I can't
Stand here and watch her dance
She got me comin' outta my pants

To jump on her, if I could
Get her outta here I would

And there's somethin' tellin' me I should
Get low"

The Game	13	Summertime	The Documentary 2	2015	[Verse 1]	"I think I might bang the whole summer
Pull up on the block in that old Missy Hummer
Hop out with my bandana tied around my head like Pac
(Like Pac, like Pac, like Pac nigga)
Westside nigga, never had a problem banging Big
Who would ever know I  spit crack when I was slanging it
My uncle Greg whipped it all the time
My daddy used to whip it all the time
My brother started whipping his and mine
I sat back, played my position until I got the hang of it
On my way to school in that Michael Jordan jersey
Crips used to sweat me but I ain't nervous
And I wore it on purpose"
Rakim	10	Flow Forever	The Master	1999	[Verse 2]	"You ever witness rapport like this before?
It's 'cause y'all kiss the floor, say Bismillah
It's the chosen one with the golden tongue
Flow for the old and young when I'm holdin' one
In the front row sit-ty, we show no pity
Where kids get jiggy and girls are so pretty
The Wanderer, back from Casablanca
To stomp all, what next for Ra to conquer?
So let's go, the best show will explode
No dress codes, they just pose in their best clothes
Girls get exposed when I show my rap expo
Will there be a next episode? I guess so
Those that have doubt, wanted to have clout
What they mad about? Must be a cash drought
MC's switch they style from they last bout
And I bet soon as they hear this, they spaz out"
Eminem	15	Say What You Say	The Eminem Show	2002	[Verse 1]	"I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit
Kick up dust, cuss 'til I slur up spit
Grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit
Corrupt, and I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick and rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to Earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep goin'
First take I make mistakes, just keep it
No punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit, I'll eat shit
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit
But what about Jermaine? "

Big Boi	26	West Savannah	Aquemini	1998	[Verse 2]	"See, niggas in the South wear gold teeth and gold chains
Been doing it for years, so these niggas ain't gone change
They coming around the ghetto so you might call em soul
Been wearing furry Kangol's, so that shit is old
You might slang a rock or two just to pay the rent
Five dollars for a table dance so now your money's spent
You listen to that booty shake music in your trunk
As long as there's that ""tic tic"" followed by that bump
I'm down to stick a ho if she got a G-string
'Cause the niggas in the Point ain't changed, man
You might call us country, but we's only Southern
And I don't give a fuck, P-Funk spot to spark another"
50 Cent	19	Thug Love	Get Rich or Die Tryin’	1999	[Verse 2]	"Ayo, I treat you like you need to be treated like you're special
Tie your hands to the bedpost when I caress you
When I met you it was Guess and Gap, now it's Gucci and Prada
Took you from being a nine to being a dime
You complain that we don't spend time
When I'm OT on the grind going hard for mine
Yo, when shorty say she hate me you know she mean she love me
When she play me close at the bar that mean she want some Bubbly
See my polying with another chick and shit get ugly
She wanna flip, threaten to run keys across my whip
Try to burn a nigga with some hominy grits
That's how she on it, when I met her she was lowkey
Now she wanna OD
You know me, I let her do her thing, son
I say what I'm feeling, niggas say that I'm illing
I sip Cristy so I'm pissy like a staircase in your building

The Game	13	Dollar and a Dream	The Documentary 2	2015	[Verse 3]	"My first album was a set up. I was the little nigga
Pac was talking to when he said ""keep your head up""
'Cause he knew what I would be facing after his demise
Jayceon had to pitch them pies, better life than flipping fries
I'm the one the Crips despise, move the Yay or kiss the sky
For having dreams that 50 died, Eulogy by Mary Blige
Hopped up in that enterprise, had to stop a genocide
Went from underdog to watching Top Dawg and Kendrick rise
Now tell me can I testify, pull over trying to rest for 5
On a block, no tint on the Wraith left these kids mesmerized
They ask me how I did it, how I got it, say I'm king you looking brolic
I put them weights down start practicing lyrical exercise
Tell me who the next to die, probably who the next in line
They got me battling ghost 'cause I'm the illest one alive
That's word to Pac, Pun, Biggie, why I stand as my city
If we was 'bout to run a train, you couldn't fuck with me
Ever since I saved my coast, it's been born again
If I ain't shit then who the king of California then?
Who could out-rap me?
Now think about if the same nigga you bout to say can run up and out-strap me
Yeah, out-trap me, yeah, out-gat me
I mean think about it, exactly
Speaking matter-of-factly I'm down playing that actually
Call me Game I ain't one still I get paid like an athlete
Do the math after the math, Doc two in the bag
Lived up to expectations, Dre took me first in the draft
Now who the fuck want what
Nobody survives so look alive when them Impalas in the cut"
Future	30	Slave Master	DS2	2015	[Chorus]	"Just bought a new whip, nigga, like I'm a slave master
I pour up two zips, nigga, I'm feelin' way better

I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
Just bought a new whip, nigga, like I'm a slave master

You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah

People call me Com and collective with perspective
I draw crowds, go off like car alarm sounds
Bomb like 'Nam sound, tell your bitch to calm down
Must want to give me skull asking me to take my hat off
I'm ill, raps I spit as if I had a bad cough (*Coughing*)
This crank nigga stole a style and ain't take the tag off
Playing yourself, you can't come with it, so you jack off
More heart than a artery, jones in my bones
To see thugs in harmony, it's gon' be some drama
You try to sit Com down, this ain't comedy
Shit is real like a station property (What?), crew is forming colonies (Yeah)
Commonly, I hear these rats thinking they mahogany
On every rap hook, sounding like a dog to me
In a reservoir, I flow and go
On and on, like Erykah or etcetera
Designated not to make hits but hit home
Out of proportion, hit makers get blown"
50 Cent	19	Just a Lil Bit	The Massacre	2005	[Verse 2]	"This is 50 comin' out your stereos
Hard to tell though 'cause I switched the flow
Eyes a lil' low 'cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll 'cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get your bitch, she on me, dawg
She musta heard about the dough
Now Captain, come on and Save-a-Ho
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart all the time mane
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed, that's without a doubt
But shawty shake that thang like a pro, man
She backed it up on me I'm like ""Oh, man""
I got close enough to her, so I know she could hear
System thumpin', party jumpin', I said loud and clear"

Some greens and that ham, not
Don't need no ham hocks, don't play me like I'm smokin' rocks
I got the munchies, we got the Mary Jane in the Dungeon
Just to let you niggas know, in '93, that's how we comin'

A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screamin' ""I don't care, just bite me!"" (Na-na)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little four-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves clowns 'cause they look queer (Hehe)
Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin' Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (Fuckin' punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin' faggots the fuck out
Aks 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out (Ah!)
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck — blaow!
Look at y'all runnin' your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fuckin' mile road south of 10
And I don't need help from D12 to beat up two females
In make-up who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
""Slim Anus""? You damn right, slim anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots"

Daz Dillinger	2	Cyco-Lic-No (Bitch Azz Niggaz)	Dogg Food	1995	[Verse 1]	"N-N-Now, who the hell wanna face me
To make me act a complete fool lately?
It's been cool, my mentality plus dope helps me cope
Wit' no smoke, I'm depressed and easily to provoke
.45's and .9's, I'm heated
Me and Kurupt puffin' on a Berry all day repeatedly
And immediately in a daze, we stoned and phased
In the back of the truck lies a gauge for any busta actin' brave
Maybe I can see what no other rapper assaults
Wit' my skills to murder 'em all
And can't be prevented when you know I'm after ya!
Got the heart to blast at'cha!
Matter-of-fact, to capture those who don't belong be on the strong
Gots to pack up and jet, booty rappers don't have long
Now, can I get a witness? My riches attract women wit' class
Dat Nigga Daz is 'bout to mash all over for da cash
Blast, then dash.. be in the getaway car now
Known rap stars turned to outlaws
Wanted for the murder — the motive of death is 'Fuck y'all!'

I represent Dogg Pound to the fullest 'cause I'm.."

She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That B.C.B.G, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She's feed them fools' fantasies, they pay her 'cause they want her
I spit a little G-Man and my game got her
An hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick talkin' in her ear, sayin' they think about her
I got her right by the bar, tryna get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that ***** tryna holla 'cause I want some ****
I'm that ***** tryna holla 'cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Man, hit that track, catch a date and come pay the kid
Look, baby, this is simple, you can't see?
You rollin' with me, you rollin' with a P-I-M-P"
50 Cent	19	God Gave Me Style	The Massacre	2005	[Verse 1]	"Listen, you can call me what you want, black and ugly
But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me
When my CD's drop, they sell the best
You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed
I'm a track star runnin' through life chasin' my dreams
Best deal I made was tradin' the mic for that triple beam
I zone off thinkin' is there really heaven or hell
If so what happens to a changed man that dies in a cell?
I need no answers to these questions, 'cause time will tell
Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl
Don't much good come from me, but my music
It's a gift given from God, so I'ma use it - yeah"
Snoop Dogg	0	Imagine	Tha Blue Carpet Treatment	2006	[Verse 2]	"Can you imagine being lit up by some hot shells?
Imagine being tossed around and put in jail
Imagine life when you can't get from under
Imagine niggas at ya when you done fo'
Remember how they asked you ""What you run for?"", and treat ya like a bitch
When they kick you in your dick and take your shit
Reactin' like they hate to see you gung-ho
But just imagine if the rabbit got the gun though, but you already know
Imagine niggas in the LBC
Felt just like Snoop Dogg and D-R-E
And felt just like them niggas in the 2-1-3
Then imagine that's what's coming when you fuckin' with me
Imagine you was up on top of this shit
Imagine if the bitches could stay off this dick
I mean, imagine we said ""Fuck this shit""
Imagine if my niggas got together and tore up this bitch, yeah
You can't imagine growing up in jail dumb
Happy just to be alive, watching all your people run
Would you imagine growing up to sell you
Fifty-million records worldwide or fuckin' off somebody's son?
Imagine if these niggas never saw a color
Would it be peaceful in them streets, would niggas kill each other?
All a drunk fool get is pissed-on balls
Keep fuckin' off my niggas, they gon' murder us all
Imagine that"

I wonder why, it's just the way it is, even now
Lookin' out for these killa kids 'cause they wild
Bill Clinton, can you recognize a nigga representin'
Doin' twenty to life in San Quentin?
Gettin' calls from my nigga, Mike Tyson, ain't nothin' nice

A drug addict, naw, fuck that, I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually what has ended up happenin'
A tragedy, the fuckin' past ended up catchin' me
And it's probably where I got acquainted with the taste, ain't it?
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb, Mom, beautiful
She killed the fuckin' dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fuckin' aspirin and say that it has a headache
""Here, want a snack? You hungry, you fuckin' brat?
Look at that, it's a Xanax, take it and take a nap, eat it""
But I don't need it — ""Well fuck it then, break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up""
Alright, ma, you win, I don't feel like arguin'
I'll do it, pop it, gobble it, and start wobblin'

MC Ren	17	Something Like That	Straight Outta Compton	1988	[Verse 1]	"Back by demand, now it's big as fuck
Because you as the public, you should know what's up
""Compton's in the House"" was more than gold, it was a hit
Cause it was based on some crazy shit

Punks made us a target and knew that we'd hit it
But that was a part of showbiz
Hey yo, homeboy, why don't you tell 'em what your name is"

But ain't no police, therefore your ass has gots to die
We play the game for keeps and if you slipped I guess you sleep
You sho' nuff fucked and now your ass is six feet deep
'Cause where I come from yo, everybody's got a gat
And niggas try your ass just to see where you got your heart at
And if your shit is flimsy then your ass is gonna bend
And like I said before there'll be no tears in the end
I'm rollin' through your hood and now my heart is filled with anger
You at your sister's house and now your sister's life's in danger (By a total stranger)
With a gang of, niggas wantin' to bang you
And hang you, stain you, with one up in the chamber
Let's take a trip up Holloway
So you can see how many niggas in my hood is down to die today
We standin' up for our own shit
And if you outside the clique then you die, bitch (Quick)
It ain't no love in this motherfucker
It ain't no love for yourself or your other brother, uh
Because we real with this shit so we stay true
And since we bang then we do what O.G. say do
I've got the mind of the man in the mirror so I'm lookin' at me vaguely
But I can't seem to fade me
I've got my pistol pawn cocked
Ready to lick shots nonstop until I see your monkey-ass drop
And let your homies know who done it
'Cause when it comes to this gangsta shit you motherfuckers know who run it, uh
So when you put this motherfucker to the test
You gotta realize something nigga (You fuckin' with the very best)
I got this killa up inside of me
I can't talk to my mother so I talk to my diary
I'm goin' off on the deep end
I found myself face-to-face with myself while I'm sleepin'
I see your picture in my head and my hands shake
You can run, you can hide, but there's no escape
My inner feelings show no mercy on my enemy
I got to get this motherfucker 'fore he gets to me
So in your own blood, you'll bathe
And I won't stop until I put this motherfucker in his fuckin' grave
And I can say this once again
You can cry but you'll still die, they'll be no tears in the end"
Nas	9	Still Dreaming	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Verse 3]	"She had several cars, she had credit cards
A castle, large master bathroom, getting a pedicure
Bellinis by the glassful, said she been meaning to ask who
Who in need of Cash Rule, who could blast tools
And I'm eating cashews, knew she was bad news
But we mad cool, nothin' sexual 'cause I knew her since high school
Grew up with my dudes, like one of my crew, she worked for Fox News
One of her mans that she lent her drop to
Won't come back with it
So she want him clapped in it
Says it's important that it looks like an accident
She was snorting and her eyes had bags in it
She was recording, had a wire, askin' shit
Four days before I came by she got bagged with bricks
Crossed the line from her world of news castin'
To a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards"
50 Cent	19	Betta Ask Somebody	Beg for Mercy	2003	[Chorus]	"If, you don't know, who I be

50 Cent	19	Ski Mask Way	The Massacre	2005	[Verse 1]	"You wanna spray at me? Go 'head; the last nigga that tried
Got hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died
Your little sister calling you stupid, reason why?
Her and your mama in the living room now hog-tied
I came up with two new ways to get rich, I can't wait
Got a brand-new SIG and that old .38
I be scheming to put a little bread on my plate
Watching dreads serve skunk through a hole in the gate
I stick a nigga for his shine, sell him back the next day
You thought I really wanted your pussy? Bitch, please
This the stash house, jackpot, there go them keys
My black G-Unit hoodie just reek of marijuana
Cocaine coming out my pores in the sauna
I'm serious, man, I'm so sincere
This the flow right here that fucked up Jeffrey's career
Make money, take money, yeah, nigga, YEAH!"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Mortal Man	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Chorus]	"The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows stay propelling

I'm funky like Africans in France to the hey
Yo hey.. kick in the bass you..

Been on the deck, I still ain't picked up the ace
The hundred.. styles I run with thick in the race
So let's ohhh.. yeah unh hunh"

Common	22	Heat	Like Water for Chocolate	2000	[Verse 2]	"Old men see visions, young men dream dreams
I rock the planet - recognize - I'm the C.R.E.A.M
Com Rules Everything and everything is
How yo' man pullin yo' weight - he ain't carryin' his
Scary the biz is like ""The Blair Witch Project""
Experiment in rooms on some bare bitch project
State senators, life twirls, most sell out
- like a dread with a white girl
You want me to cypher with you and the Gods?
I just did a show - I'm pursuin' these broads
Everyone I ain't tryin' to fuck
Wanna feel female presence and conversation a touch
You'll get split like a date that's dusk scuffed and scraped up
Taped up for tryin' to say what - ever you was about to say
You rap like a nigga that's about to spray
Get a mouth shot, for openin' your mouth to say
Feel my heat in the night - it leaves you without the day
What I write is a passage for niggas to travel through
Before defeatin' me - Joe, you better battle you
I tap into my own zone like it's my home phone
Turn the cell off and let my dome roam
Shame I gotta do white labels to keep my life stable
I write fatal bringin' niggas to life
A wise man came in the thick of the night
He said bring that shit when you pick up the mic
I said, ""What shit?""
He said hot shit, hot shit, hot shit"
Eminem	15	Brainless	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 2]	"Fast forward some years later, a teenager; this is fun, sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat I've accomplished
They've stomped me into the mud, gee
For what reason you stumped me?
But how do you get the shit beat out of you, beat down
And be upbeat when you don't have nothing?
No valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed
'Cause you're doomed from the start
It's like you grew up on Jump Street, from jump street
But if I could just get my head out my ass
I could accomplish any task, practicin' trash-talkin' in a trance
Locked in my room, yeah, but I got some plans, momma
These damn rhymes are fallin' out of my pants pocket, I can't stop it!
And I'm startin' to blend in more, in school this shit helps for sure
I'm gettin' more self-assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore
I done put a stop to that, threw my first punch, end of story
Still, in my skull’s a vacant empty void, been usin' it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory: in this gourd, there's a Ford engine, door
Hinge, syringe, an orange, an extension cord, and a ninja sword
Not to mention four linchpins, an astringent stored
Ironin' board, a bench, a wrench, a ore winch, an attention whore
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fuckin' chain
Like an independent store, something's wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't
'Cause I'd probably be Dahmer, 'cause Momma always said"
Travis Scott	33	FE!N	UTOPIA	2023	[Verse 1]	"The career's more at stake when you in your prime (At stake)
Fuck that paper, baby, my face on the dotted line (Dot, )
I been flyin' out of town for some peace of mind
It's like always they just want a piece of mine (Ah)
I been focused on the future, never on right now (Ah)
What I'm sippin' not kombucha, either pink or brown (It's lit)
I'm the one that introduced you to the you right now (Mm, let's go)
Oh my God, that bitch bitin' (That bitch bitin')
Well, alright (Alright), tryna vibe (I'm tryna vibe this)
In the night, come alive
Ain't asleep, ain't a—, ain't a—, ain't-ain't"
Eminem	15	Crack a Bottle	Relapse	2009	[Verse 1]	"Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse, the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you, hoes"
Big Boi	26	N2U	Idlewild	2006	[Verse 2]	"Now that I'm a graduate, she still gotta have it
School days are over, spike the punch, and you can stab it
Joog joog, more joog, kush, pull, more wood
Ice and tone her glove, bedding nicely cause we go good together
Like Salt-N-Pepa, Kool Aid and sugar, mustard and mayonnaise
Shoulda, coulda, and woulda, uhhh
And that is no intended pun, I'm just joshin' with you hun
Don't we always have a blast as we bust one on one
One on one"
Scarface	11	Goin’ Down	The Diary	1994	[Verse 2]	"Reminiscing on the bitch that I had back in the day
Gave the bitch a call and she hung up in my face
Now that's the breaks
She didn't have to put up a front
I stuck that ass back in there
And haven't called her for 3 months
I guess it's in me to be doggin' a chic
Can't understand how you niggas just be hogging your bitch
Go on and pass her, unass her, send her to the master
Let her take a ride with the Bradster
It cool, don't front ..ooooh, no sex
No sweat-not even on my mind-we just met
And furthermore, we can get to those
But for now, I'm rolling 'Raris spitting this to hoes:"
Kanye West	5	Famous	The Life of Pablo	2016	[Verse 1]	"For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets, give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous
They mad they still nameless
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous
Yeah, we still hood famous"
Eminem	15	Say Goodbye Hollywood	The Eminem Show	2002	[Verse 3]	"I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it
For me to have this much appeal like this is sick
This is not a game, this fame in real life, this is sick
""Publicity stunt"" my ass, ""conceal"" my fuckin' dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never whipped some ass
I love my fans, but no one ever puts a grasp
On the fact, I've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt, I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more than I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood or mask
What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that?
It's like the boy in the bubble who never could adapt
I'm trapped, if I could go back, I never would've rapped
I sold my soul to the Devil, I'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine goin' from bein' a no-one to seein'
Everything blow up, and all you did was just grow up emceein'
It's fuckin' crazy, ‘cause all I wanted was to give Hailie
The life I never had, instead I forced us to live alienated
So I'm sayin'"
Common	22	Orange Pineapple Juice	Resurrection	1994	[Verse 2]	"Mister Pussy Emcee, just get on gone
Get on gone, you pussy MC!

My great, great, grandpap done been through
So much it's in my hemoglobin to be a ill nigga
So I figure like a father... that I'mma Turn This Mutha Out
But Common you ain't hittin in New York
I don't know what you thought hops, but chief I got tall props
Some cats think I'm six feet I'm so deep
Some stunts be thinkin I'm six-fo', my shit be hittin like switches
Bitches, ask, why my, britches, sag
I ask the bitches, ""Why your titties saggin?""
Put your nipple to the bottle I bust rhymes like breastses
I can get down, d-d-d-down like a pessimist
""Ring the Alarm"", I got Charm like a neck-a-lace
Tell the truth, tell the truth, y'all had to move your neck to this
Didn't you, didn't you... and it, and it, and it
And it don't stop, bust it"

Teachers at the school knowing

Now, all I know, I know all these things"
Eminem	15	Criminal	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Chorus]	"I'm a criminal!
'Cause every time I write a rhyme these people think it's a crime
To tell 'em what's on my mind, I guess I'm a criminal!
I don't gotta say a word, I just flip 'em the bird
And keep goin', I don't take shit from no one

Prodigy	8	Party Over	The Infamous	1995	[Verse 1]	"Every day of my life, since 11-2-74
On the street, makin' non-stop C.R.E.A.M. galore
Packin' heat, stickin' up weed stores and more
Collectin' interest off of extortions to settle my score
It gets deeper, when things get real
I'm down to stick a NatWest Bank for my meal
And I'm from Hempstead, it's close to the shacks of Park Side
While I be outside slingin', you always hide
And don't come around to the crossroads of life
Where to the death of you and me, there's beef for eternity
I'm goin' out to the fullest extent
So far into my troubles, it's hard for me to get back
To my everyday self and composure
Catch you when you open, then I bring you to a closure
Put ice on a razor, and freeze you in ya shoulder
I went for ya grill, but you dipped from my boulder
I know this kid who says he knows ya
Because of that, now I know where you lay your head at, and that's that!
Say no more, I put it on you while you was yawnin'
Murder without warnin' the very next mornin'"
Kendrick Lamar	16	luther	GNX	2024	[Chorus]	"In this world, concrete flowers grow
Heartache, she only doin' what she know
Weekends, get it poppin' on the low
Better days comin' for sure
If this world were—
If it was up to me
I wouldn't give these nobodies no sympathy
I'd take away the pain, I'd give you everything
I just wanna see you win, wanna see
If this world were mine"
2Pac	18	Initiated/Thug Pound	Retaliation, Revenge and Get Back	1998	[Verse 3]	"Now, take a look inside my mind
That pen' time made me wise and still I rise
'Cause my ambitions as a rider like landmines
Lyrics turn niggas into smithereens
Music so lethal, turn coliseums to murder scenes
I'm Makaveli the Don, that's what they tell me
I'm armed, I'm droppin' niggas like bombs, get in that ass like a thong
Picture a felon in your presence
Takin' busters back to the essence
Tellin' my people peep my lethal message
Visions of me gettin' money got me in mash mode
Murderous motives for niggas stoppin' my cash flow
You can't fight it, nigga, let go
Witness the sound, made your bitch ass bow down to Death Row
Mama, these niggas got me fightin' these three strikes
Showin' up in court, fuck what you thought, it's street Nikes
I put the game down first, put my niggas up on it

See, when I was a youngster, used to wear them fuckin' Pro Keds
My mama made me do it but the Devil, he made me smarter
Taught me to jack them weak-ass niggas for they fuckin' Starters (Yeah, ha-ha-ha)
In the middle school, I was a bigger fool
I wore a tank top to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call 'em my uncles
They taught me how to smoke herb, I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense, I was Rosemary's baby
And then I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
Hell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see, I pimped 'em
Bitch never had my money, so I never whipped 'em (What's up, ho?)
Wait, see, all the players came and all the players went
A player ain't a gangster, but a player can handle his shit, bitch
You need to get up, get out, get something
Smoke out 'cause it's all about money, money, money
Yeah, I said it, a nigga sportin' plaits and a Braves hat
I hang with Rico Wade 'cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy
I'm true to Organized 'cause they raised me
I'm also down with LaFace 'cause L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me

Yeah, it's real cool gettin' paid fat pockets and all that other fat shit like that, ha-ha"

Screw you, before you
Real niggas said I was cool, now I got you
They envy me 'cause I'm with you
You floss too much
Turn niggas out, one touch
For you, my guns bust
You always said in GOD we trust
It's hard enough to keep counting on you
You cheat with government thugs, got the IRS pounding on you
I think I liked you better when you were illegal
But you had to get professional, musical
Now when we fuck we use prophylactic, hard plastic
Stick you in ATM's, limited cash quick
Said you'd give me luxury, when I asked it
Fucking me, I gave you back shots in ya assets
Promised happiness, but really did nothing for me
I guess bitches like you just grow on trees"

And I'd cry and I'd scream, ""Baby, please don't leave!""
Snatch the keys from your hand, I would squeeze

Like acrobatics, I'm charismatic, my gat is magic
It makes rappers disappear, whisper in your ear, crystal clear
""Come here, let me kiss your tears!""
Everything you fear is here, you ain't gotta search further
The first murder's the worst, now I thirst further
For reverse birth, every verse hurts, every curse word's
Already more offendin' than Eddie Murph's worst
I thirst for blood like a vampire
Any man claimin' his game's tighter IS A GODDAMN LIAR!
I set 'em on fire, retire your train of thought
Drain a quart of blood out ya brain and leave ya insane in the dark

And sprays the town with the MAC, hoodied down

Die in disgrace or face your death through the speaker"

I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs
Which should've been a reason enough for me to get my stuff
And just leave, how come I couldn't see this shit myself?
It's just me, nobody couldn't see the shit I felt
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
To catch me; the minute shit was heated, she just bailed
I'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around, saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down, try to get my feet on solid ground
So for now—"

Big Pun	24	Twinz (Deep Cover ’98)	Capital Punishment	1998	[Verse 3]	"I rub your face off the Earth and curse your family's children
Like Amityville, and drill the nerves in your cavity fillin'

A villain without remorse who's willin' to out your boss
Forever and take all the cheddar like child support"
Big Boi	26	Ova da Wudz	ATLiens	1996	[Verse 3]	"Yeah, uh
It's some hoes in this house, damn right
I'm thinking about the way you skull me, girls be
Sucking me dry like deserts Mojave, Gotti, hotties and honeydips
Liking the way you do me, screw me and make my money flip
Shaking that ass for daddy, putting this gas off in my Cadi-llac
Back, don't ever snap, packing the gats and pimping whores
Hors d'oeuvres, swerve, hit the curb because I'm reckless (Uh)
Back in the days when I was broke I'd snatch your fucking necklace
You ol' pussy-ass nigga... (Yeah) yeah"
Kanye West	5	Real Friends	The Life of Pablo	2016	[Chorus]	"Real friends

A voice quietly tellin' me, ""You gotta come up on some bread""
Don't get it twisted for shit, see, I be mashin' on my own mission
Never dreamin' or wishin' the money that I'm missin'
Heard some niggas doubt, clockin', rakin' in all the dough
And since I'm doin' bad, I gotta jakk for they dough
Called my partners in crime — Kurupt, Nate Dogg and Style
True soldiers from Tha Dogg Pound, puttin' it down
Kick the do' in wit' the gauge and fo'-fo' (Don't move)
Blast a couple of niggas as I style wit' all the dough
Five pounds of coke, two pounds of orange
Now we baggin' it up, and smokin' all night long
I wanna trip, then I didn't have no chip
And my pockets were short, and I started to trip
To maintain waddn't no problem, stopped by my bitch house
She was poppin' with them sales, I don't play that shit! (Bitch!)
And sold five-hundred in cavi, barely happy today
Finna knock her out, and my homie had to say (Well..)"

Son, get that loot quick, spendin' dough like I never had shit
I'm livin' large, pushin' luxury cars
Though that shit is outta reach, anybody in my way gets scarred
Permanently bed-ridden
And if you're pussy, then motherfucker, get in where you fit in
As I walk around the streets
Son, I got mad beef, I'mma blast you before you blast me
That's my philosophy 'cause nowadays you gotta be relentless
Grab my MAC and slap a nigga senseless
Don't try to play me, if you do, you better D.O.A. me
Son, I got 'em shook, grab a little baby for shields
You got drama, run for shelter for real
Pour some beer for the ill, ain't no time to chill
Hit 'em up, 'cause I'm quick to erupt like dicks
Wet 'em up with the MAC, scratch 'em off my list
Show 'em the real meanin' of drama, you never had it

Ain't nuttin' soft or sweet, I lift you off your feet
When I cock back the heat, whole crews retreat"

And I told you to wait
Yeah, I told you to wait
So I'ma need a little more time now
'Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me (Black bodies)

Not a pretty nigga, but my moms think I'm handsome
I hate to hear he say, she say shit
Unless he say she said she on my dick
It's no coincidence niggas who fuck with me get shot up (Blatt)
I do it Cali style, drive by and tear your block up
You soft, duke, you putting up a crazy front
I stay with the MAC 'cause niggas tried to blaze me once
In the hood, they like, ""Damn, 50 really spit it on 'em""
""You heard that shit?"" ""Yeah, 50 really shitted on 'em""
Beef, you don't want none, so don't start none
You're just a small player in this game, play your part, son"

Was the start of somethin good
Where me and my nigga rodes the MARTA, through the hood
Just tryin ta find that hookup
Now everyday we looked up at the ceiling (Yup)
Watchin ceiling fans go around tryin ta catch that feelin
Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes tryin ta find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowin' that we could rock (Uh)
Doin the hole in the wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like freeze, we makin the crowd move but we not makin no G's

The host by far a mostly O.T
With a brand new show but you know how the flow be
'Cause when I swerve, you observe it closely
If you smoke trees, smoke more than an OZ
Mix any kind of dope with me, you OD
You get the CD, LP, C-O-D
Poetry cause you to fully load the V
Drop place to place be crazy over me
Even different nationalities, overseas
However do a don't emcee, you know me

Eminem	15	We Made You	Relapse	2009	[Verse 1]	"Ahem, back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand?
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?
Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
""Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans!""
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just ‘cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then squish it, then pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can, Ken, don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But, Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a two; you're practically a ten
I know you want me, girl, in fact, I see you grin
Now come in, girl"
Nas	9	Letter to the King	LAX	2008	[Verse 2]	"Uhh, word up, Game
Standin' at the pew, panaramic view of the seatin' and greetin'
I've been meanin' to do me some letter readin'
To the King, he forever breathin', your message is never leavin'
Some of your homies phonies, I should've said it when I see them
Them sleazy bastards, some greedy pastors, jerks
Should never be allowed at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta
So people be patient, I know this ghetto grammar
But I'm a street dude, normally I just speak rude
Martin Luther, the martyr, the trooper, hate killed him
Nobel Peace Prize winner, they duplicate your feelin'
As a kid I ain't relate really
I would say your dream speech jokingly, 'til your words awoke in me
First I thought you were passive, soft one who ass kissed
I was young but honest, I was feelin' Muhammad
I ain't even know the strength you had to have to march
You was more than just talk, you the first real Braveheart
We miss you
Feel like King be in me sometimes"
Guru	20	Suckas Need Bodyguards	Hard to Earn	1994	[Verse 3]	"I've been around, punk, but yo, I still feel young
A few of my crew members like to pack guns
I'm high strung, but don't mistake me when I smile
I'll murder an entire rap chart with my freestyle
After the killing, just like Casper, I'm ghost
Fakes thought I was friendly, at their wakes I was host
Toast without a gun, you'd be done
Throw up your hands, bitch, and now you know you stand to lose one
Choose one metaphor and then choose another
Wax that ass like a bully, have you calling your big brother
Although I'm five foot eight, they call me sergeant
Got more hoes on my dick than you can fit in the garden
At Madison Square, I shot a fair one
So many niggas knew me that the kid wouldn't dare run
MCs pay cash to ensure their safety
They know they can't take me, the G-A-N-G, you crazy?
I'll be on them like a message from God
Knowledge of self while fake MCs play hard"
Dr. Dre	1	The Dayz Of Wayback	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Verse 2]	"It was once a time in the days of wayback
When niggas was gettin' jacked
In fact, it was when I used to pass through the
And kickin' ass through a motherfuckin' Compton Massacre
Now, let me tell you a little somethin' about Compton
When I was a kid and puttin' my bid in
Yo, Compton was like still water - extremely calm
Now it's like motherfuckin' Vietnam
Everybody killin', tryin' to make a killin'
Niggas stealin', motherfuckers wheelin' and dealin'
With so many ways to come up
The average nigga didn't give a fuck
About another motherfucker in this game and
Claimin' what he claimin', livin' like he livin', killin' after killin'
Murder was a dirty job, to rob a dead man was the best plan
'Cause a dead man never ran
But now your best friend is your worst friend
Greed, kids to feed, make a me more some of what you holdin'
So, now your shit is stolen and you and your niggas start rollin'
Yo, to get your shit back ain't the word up
Muff? It's more murder, more murder, more murder
They wanna make you think that it's a crack thang or a black thang
Or some niggas in a motherfuckin' gang
But guns and money, they go together like the Ku Klux Klan
A nigga brung up and strung up
Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Rememberin' the days that's past me
Yo, never givin' niggas a chance to rest
The ghetto is like a fuckin' survival test
And number one way for you to pass
Yo, get treated like a king and they'll crown your ass
They never in the wrong though so I made a song so
Motherfuckers would know
If your livin' situations make you wanna get a gat (a gat)
That's 'cause you livin' in the Dayz of Wayback..."
JAY-Z	6	Allure	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 1]	"The allure of breaking the law
Was always too much for me to ever ignore
I've got a thing for the big-body Benzes, it dulls my senses
In love with a V-Dub engine
Man, I'm high off life, fuck it, I'm wasted
Bathing Ape kicks, Audemars Piguet wrist
My women-friends get tennis bracelets
Trips to Venice, get their Winters replaced with
The sun...it ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded
Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it
I put my feet in the footprints left to me
Without saying a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy
Man, my brother hustled so, naturally
Up next was me, but what perplexes me
Shit, I know how this movie ends, still I play
The starring role in ""Hovito's Way"""

And takin’ her straight back to the Motel-8
Yeah, Bizarre's tryna get a lap dance
Off a Xanax and Jack Dan'
Stripper walk by, I'm like ""Goddamn""
She's like ""That's harassment,"" I'm like ""Yeah, and?"" (Woo)
Holy Toledo, it's Miss Ohio
That’s the best ass I’ve seen in a while
We should be datin', she’s from Cleveland
But she's a bengal, this chick is catty
Is that a mini-skirt if it's a maxi?
That's the shortest thing for a dress since an addy (Since an addy)
She said ""Fuck off"" and threw her liquor at me
Then I said, I said"

Da Big Boss Dogg, yeah, I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hangin' out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah, that's the Crip side

I cut so much, you thought I was a DJ *vinyl rewind*

S-N double O-P, D-O double G
I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See, I specialize in makin' all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live (So don't)

And those that did did it by the skin of their hide
Dodgin' that long ride, the four-fifth aimed at 'em
And knew to fall back when them slugs came at 'em
On the real, for me to be here tellin' ya'll this
Is like dice, then I rolled that 456
And never lost ever since, though I took that big pinch
Brother passed away, 24/7 I was bent
Drunk in my pain, a lot of friends went and then came
And those that stayed understood a nigga pain (That's right)
And for a nigga's problems had no one to point the blame (Right)
I was my own worst enemy goin' against the grain
Somewhere along the line, them pieces had to get grabbed
All this money plus family, shit wasn't that bad (That bad)
All you little shorties runnin' 'round like shits sweet
Just remember these words from the M-O-double-B
And it's real"

My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent

Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins

Fuckin' doctor, I ain't understand a damn word he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton, I ain't enlightened
Bitin' into a fuckin' Vicodin like I'm a Viking
Oh, lightning is strikin', it might be a fuckin' sign I need a psychic
Evaluation, fuck Jason, it's Friday the 19th

I keep three hoes in my room at one time
Two nickels and the other's a dime
You wouldn't wanna, keep a hood on her
When I'm dropping that motherfucking wood on her
Cause I perform, a G like Warren
A nigga getting paid off shooting porn

Armani, and Gaultier specs cover my eyes
The definition of jiggy so you best to recognize
At the mall, I'm baggin' up, much more than gear
Victoria, be whisperin' mad Secrets in my ear
She wanted me to knock her in the back of Foot Locker
I chuckled as she kicked more game than soccer
Others try to copy, I see 'em when they mock me
Baseball cap bent, the fresh scent, Issey Miyake
All the way from Green Acres to the Beverly Center
Heads turn, and I'm the main concern when I enter
At Albee Square, niggas wouldn't even dare
With that fake thuggish ruggish when them Brooklyn kids be in there
Sonia Rykiel sweet for my girl
Stylin', on the cell phone smilin', it's my world
Can't forget the Avirex, pocket for the royalty checks
My crew be showin' loyalty, plus utmost respect
Yo son, go pioneer them bimbos, while I get some Timbo's
Later on that night you'll find them nymphos
That's how it goes cause mad heads be in the mall
Let's breeze, we got a show, plus I got another phone call"

Put Compton on my back when you in need of soldiers
At my last show I threw away my N.W.A. gold
I had the whole crowd yellin ""Free Yayo!""
So niggas better get up outta mine
For I creep and turn your projects into Columbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems your lil rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly South

They wanna knock me off the edge like a fuckin' widow's peak, uh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uh
Dear Lord, come save me, the devil's working hard
He probably clockin' double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightenin', so fuckin' frightenin'
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill
I'm standing on a field full of land mines
Doin' the moonwalk, hopin' I blow up in time
'Cause 2012 might not be a fuckin' legend
Tryna be a fuckin' legend, the man of mankind
Who said a Black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party

You know me, I'm the smooth macadamien, gamin' them for my homie
No needing bein' calm if you pack right
And earnin' just enough to keep your sack right
Late nights, I wonder what they gettin' for?
Early mornin' on the corners, what they hittin' for?
Seven young G's put they serve down
In a G ride, east side's where they swerve now
Not thinkin' about what's really goin' on
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone
I spent four years in the county with nothin' but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the Pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make

So ain't no need for your mama to trip
'Cause you's a hustlin'-ass youngster, clockin' your grip"

Brother Com, gotta make our move through
The stylist and violence with vibrance
The sign of times with rhyme shit is timeless
The mind is a terrible thing to spill
Rap life's like a dream that seems for real
A nigga wake up, superstar, with no acres
After travellin the world to see paper's just paper
Streets take ya back and forth like a shaker
I'm a slave to the rhythm's breakin off
I get the job done, but some days I wanna take off
D be like, ""We ain't got no time for that!""
?uestlove said, ""We ain't got no time for that!""
My old bird like, ""We ain't got no time for that!""
So I rhyme when my back hurts
Play the numbers from my grandmother like Kraftwerk
I rock the patchwork fast I'm in to win but then begin to sin
We're in to win with Hen's and Heineken's
Beast for each and greet the meek with speech
To seek and peak cause Pete, shit gets deep
I fuh-fuh-freak, styles that come out
At night, when most cats pull the gun out
Go on and on and, to the break of when the
Sound run out, run out, r-run out
C uhh, yeah"

Hopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play
To the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway
I said, ""Bet you'll never guess in a million years
What I just saw happenin' — and probably still is
Snuck in my crib, some nigga fuckin' my wis'
I saw them, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid
I'ma grab shorty, I need you to grab the nigga for me""
Just when I thought I found love, she shitted on me
Shopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement
Twenty G's on a ring I would've hit her today with
My surprise couldn't match the one she had for me
We pulled up, he was walkin' out the house backwardly
Parked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us
Ran to the side of my house, cocked the heater
Walked to the front, when I talked, he had jumped
Bitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot
Shot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in
Grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend
One between the eye, she's died, by mistake
Must've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face
Heard somebody knock—Horse helped me hide the bodies
Heard si-rens, I guess we goin' out like kamikaze
We surrounded, red lights flashin', who's inside?
Came out a bullhorn, I'm contemplatin' suicide
Horse asked me for the MAC, he gave me dap, one love
Cocked the strap, then he ran out the back
Mad shots, couldn't tell what was goin' on
Sat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms
Pulled her ring out my pocket I was savin'
Put it on her ring finger, cocked the Glock and started prayin'
To Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial
Through you, all things are possible, I know you're listenin'
I never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed
This'd be my fate, such a grotesque murder scene
On that note, same time, the cops busted in
Kissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said ""Amen""
Put the nine to my head, pulled the hammer
Held her close, squeeze the toast
Said to her, ""Now unto God, we elope... we elope"""
OutKast	28	ATLiens	ATLiens	1996	[Chorus]	"Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care

I'm goin' at you, take it to the gats if I have to
It's the hassle, jealous thugs I suppose squeeze
Turn that ass to Swiss cheese, leave permanent holes
And to them hoes, you know how it go, no dough
'Cause they subject to wakin' with cash and go crazy
Yeah, they bangin', baby
Havoc representin' for them niggas that don't trick
Ladyless, just associates
Appropriate, no doubt, but bust it
I love this rap shit, got me fillin' mad clips, but half is
Them fake rappers, but they damn good actors
From population, through the math, I subtract a
You hear no laughter, QBC the thug factor
You niggas ain't worth the punch, back smack ya
Pitbull attack ya, and half-snap ya
Kodak moments I capture
Like an escaped convict
Pearl Harbor, bomb shit
Handle B-I, on some calm shit"
Common	22	The 6th Sense	Like Water for Chocolate	2000	[Verse 1]	"The perseverance of a rebel, I drop heavier levels
It's unseen or heard, a king with words
Can't knock the hustle, but I've seen street dreams deferred
Dark spots in my mind where the scene occurred
Some say I'm too deep, I'm in too deep to sleep
Through me, Muhammad will forever speak
Greet brothers with handshakes on ghetto landscapes
Where a man is determined by how much a man make
Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
With cigarettes in their ear, niggerish they appear
Under the Fubu is a guru, that's untapped
Want to be in the rap race but ain't ran one lap
Ran so far from the streets that you can't come back
You tripping with nowhere to unpack, forgot that"
Future	30	Stick Talk	DS2	2015	[Pre-Chorus]	"Took a shot of Henny, I've been going brazy, brazy

The Game	13	Bulletproof Diaries	LAX	2008	[Verse 1]	"Money in zipped duffle bags, shotgun shells
My killas gorillas, niggas couldn't see 'em with gazelles
Fronting ass niggas, go hang with Pharrell
Trying to be a Cowboy, you catch bullets like Terrell
Owens, call it T.O., he leaking like a project sink
Busted open like a hot dog link
 it gave me time to think, yeah I did my fucking prison thing
Came out still on point, like the RZA rings
I'm from Compton but my inkpen live in Queens
Rep the dub like Wu-Tang, and I got Killa Bees 
Black Wall Mafia, new millenium Genovese
Got a million dollars say LeBron don't win a ring 
I know Kobe, I be on the floor, ""Kobe!""
You know a nigga that can score 81? Show me!
I got a Cuban Link to a fuckin O.G
And nigga you're too close, what the fuck, you trying to blow me? 
This the face off  diamonds all in the charm
 Where you be? 
Where you from?  Californ'
 Me too "

Don't believe the hype, Dre the Chuck D in it
Aftermath, G-Unit, Shady rap politics
Eat this beef shit, load up hollow-tips
Bulls, I cock back, .45, swallow shit
Lift niggas soul up like a hydraulics switch
All I know is gangbangin', bandanas, poppin' clips
Ass out, three-wheelin', bangin' ""2Pacalypse""
Hood rat, model chick, six-four Impala shit
G's up, hoes down, make bitches swallow dick

My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night, he snuck in and said
""We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed""
Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
""After I fuck you in the butt, get some head, bust a nut, get some rest""
The next day, my mother said ""I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid!
The bastard won't even eat nothing, he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom, he's dead!""
""Debbie, don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck
I'll bet you he's fakin' it, I'll bet you
I bet he probably just wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this, of course, unless you object?""

Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rallys, bullshit
Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them white girls before them blunts got crunk
Chunky asses, passes getting throwed like Hail Marys
And they looking like Halle Berrys
So, so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother, James, things changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, ""Momma, I want to sing
But, momma, I want to trick (Trick), and momma, I'm sucking dicks, now""
We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew, we pimps like '82

But I damn near got caught 'cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this before
With a producer who can rap and control the micstro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection
Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
Of what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do"

The most recent was 50 in Angola, that's what's up
Any rapper can get touched, any bitch can get fucked
Under the California sun, Impalas and big trucks
They say Suge got knocked out, but don't play that nigga cheap
'Cause your body might wash up by the courts of Venice Beach
Ain't shit sweet but my Swisher, ain't shit buzzing but my liquor
Cali' chickens go to the A to strip and come back a little thicker
With more ass than Deelishis, that's my flavor of love
We make it rain like Rain Man when he played with The Glove
I'm the King to you pawn niggas, Punisher, Spawn niggas
Playing in green, Paul Pierce to you LeBron niggas
We done barbequed, front and back lawned niggas
Summer Jam, throw your ass off stage, Akon niggas
We drink Kool-Aid with the ice on your arm, nigga
Take that Champion hoodie off in the California sunshine"

Why you playing in the streets? You just a baby"
Eminem	15	White America	The Eminem Show	2002	[Verse 2]	"Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon, baby, Ooh, baby! Look at my sales
Let's do the math: If I was Black, I would've sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Give me the mic, show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was White
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
""Fuck it,"" until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top, every fan Black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every White fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped, sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is it startin' to work to my benefit now? It's—"

Rewind get this dough, I guess it ain't your night
Suckin' me in like a vacuum, I remember
Tellin' my family: ""I'll be back soon""; that was December
'85 and Jay-Z rise 10 years later
Got me wise still can't break my underworld ties
I wear black a lot, in the Ac', act a lot
Got matchin' VCR's, a huge Magnavox
Ten inch, green like spinach, pop wines that's vintage
It's a lot of big money in my sentence
Hittin' towards a mil', lip a, written I kill like that
Check baby one-two cat, yeah, I do that
Ain't no stoppin' the champagne from poppin'
The drawers from droppin', the law from watchin', I hate 'em"
JAY-Z	6	My 1st Song	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 2]	"Like I never rode in a limo
Like I just dropped flows to a demo (Woo)
Like it's '92 again and
And I got O's in the rental (Ugh)
Back in the Stu' again, no problemo
Was a whole lot simple; when you think back
You thought that you would never make it this far; then you—
Take advantage of the luck you handed
Or the talent you been given
Ain't no half-steppin'; ain't no, no slippin'
Ain't no different from a block that's hittin'
Gotta get it while the getting's good
Gotta strike while the iron's hot
When you stop, then you gotta bid it good riddance
Goodbye! This is my second major breakup
My first was with a pager
With a hoopty, a cook-pot, and the game
This one's with the stu', with the stage, with the fortune—
Well, maybe not the fortune—but certainly the fame"

""Fuck Cuzz,"" nah, nigga, motherfuck you

Niggas in New York know how Doggy get down

I got my business in Manhattan, I ain't fuckin' around
I got some butter pecan Puerto Ricans from the Boogie Down (Down)

We don't share the same synonym, fall back (West, west, west)
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack (Ooh-ooh)
My innocence limited, the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did it, in fact (Yeah)
You admitted it once I submitted it, wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now, I can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sinnin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision, Kendrick is master that mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menaces turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction while writing blue magic
Thank God for rap
I would say it got me a plaque, but what's better than that?
The fact it brought me back home"

Give her backshots while she layin' down
Keep the Glock cocked, I don't trust hoes
Top shotter, goin' for the gusto
Like a real dog, got a mutt ho
Get the lo', you a John Doe
Bubble-eye Benz on a ho
Rappin' so pretend, you a ho
Nine-figure nigga, tag a toe
Ain't no tappin' in, better blow
Shorty poppin' pills, but he blessed
Flash a couple M's on my chest
Ain't no sabotagin', lil' finesse
We was in the field, placin' bets
Still gettin' chills in my flesh
Takin' karma, turn it to success
Thoroughbred and Pluto, nothin' less
Twenty drivers parked at the jet
Whip the Phantom to the projects

Knocked a nigga off his feet, but I crawled back

Everything them four walls had taught me, made habits bury deep
That man knew a lot, but not enough to keep me past them streets
My life is a plot, twisted from directions that I can't see
Daddy issues ball across my head, told me, ""Fuck a foul""
I'm teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won't think out loud
A foolish pride, if I lose again, won't go in the house
I stayed outside, laughin' with my friends, they don't know my lifе
Daddy issues made me lеarn losses, I don't take those well
Momma said, ""That boy is exhausted,"" he said, ""Go fuck yourself
If he give up now, that's gon' cost him, life's a bitch
You could be a bitch or step out the margin,"" I got up quick
I'm chargin' baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance

Oh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice
Tactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues"

Ask around who's laid up, sharp and straight up
Mafioso, gettin' niggas' wakes sprayed up
Skies are misty, my life predicted by a gypsy
I'll one day walk into shots, drunk off champagne from Sicily
This be the drama, I'ma pause like a comma in a sentence
Paragraphs indented
Bloodshot red eyes, high, yellow envelopes of lye
Openin' cigars, let tobacco fly
Condos are tune-proof, we're lookin' out the sky's moon roof
Shittin' like gin and prune juice
Yo, the system wants the coon's noose — hang 'em high
Courtrooms filled up
It's off the hook while I just wrote a statement

Each twin grab an arm, pick this nigga up
Nitty turn his face to me and let me wake him up
I throw him up against the wall and put a hole in his face so big
It almost took his whole face off
We got the team positioned, ready for faceoff
We blitz like Dallas in the Super Bowl faceoff
We form like niggas in the yard up north
With long swords, ready for war, who paid cost
To take your life lost, never found again, boss
A job well done, relax, throw back fifths
Of Bacardi Limon, fifteenths of hash get lit (Light it up, son)
Fuckin' with the fabulous Mobb, yeah, you a sick
Lunatic, nigga jump up, but got hit
With MACs and TECs and silencers spit
Shots whiz past your earlobe and shit
That's the sound of a nigga almost felt it
Got you runnin', dodgin', coverin', shelterin'

JAY-Z	6	Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe (Remix)	good kid, m.A.A.d city	2013	[Verse 2]	"Up in the clouds
Me and my spouse
Rumors on the ground gettin' too loud
Please turn them shits down (Down, down)
Can't hear myself think
Turbulence, shit, I almost spilled my drink
In the White House with a mink, runnin' through that bitch
Like it's my house, all up in the hall like a mall
Told you motherfuckers, all I do is ball
No, I don't 'member you, I don't intend to
Empty my memory bank
It's a million dollars in it, baby, Hilary Swank
Sittin' next to Hillary smellin' like dank
Presidential pardon, name one nigga out there harder than him
I'll wait
I've been in my wave like twenty years straight
I've been on my vibe like twenty years straight
Don't fuck up my high (Fuck up my high)
Nights like this, I could fuck up a pie
Still be straight (Still be straight)
Fall back, bitch, I got a lot on my plate
Don't waste my breath
I don't know how many moons a nigga got left
Back to this joint
Smokin' this shit like I'm tryna prove a point
I'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno
Kill my vibe, that's your motherfuckin' funeral
Hahaha"

2Pac	18	Tha’ Lunatic	2Pacalypse Now	1991	[Verse 2]	"Leave me the fuck alone, you gets none of this
It's suicidal, you lose your title like Doug-las
'Cause I'm nothin' nice and, I'm icin' like Tyson
I'm grippin' the mic and my DJ is slicin'
I'm tired of motherfuckers steppin' to me with the same old
Tryin' to do me like Nintendo
How the fuck you think I ever got this far?
By bootin' motherfuckers like a shootin' star
'Cause I'm out to show that I'm a dope MC
Think crack had you fiendin', wait'll they get a load of me
Bitches on my dick like a motherfuckin' condom
Niggas wanna flip, let 'em step, and I'll bomb 'em
See somethin' you want, why don't you come and get it
And then get waxed and taxed, like the government
Then I leave you sittin' there, wonder where your money went
While your bitch is callin' me, tellin' me to come again
Nigga I'm loc'ed, when I smoke, from the indo
But we can be friends though, after you get broke like a window
That's what you provoked, and now you're smoked out
Lookin' like a bitch, 'cause your whole fuckin' posse broke out
Punk motherfucker couldn't roll on
He couldn't hold on, game is too strong, nigga
Leave me the fuck alone, you gets none of this
Feel the wrath, and revenge of the lunatic"
Kurupt	4	Reality	Dogg Food	1995	[Verse 2]	"As complexed as the situation gets
I remain, I maintain, ain't that much strain
To make me twist myself like Kurt Cobain (HA!)
Aw shit! I don't believe this
Some niggas that I fucked wit' tryin' to pull a twist
But ain't that much twistin' in existence
And this is how you show me love
It shows me exactly what money's capable of (That's right)
Now, is it the expenses
That make you wanna catch me slippin' and pay a visit?
'Cause this is for all my homies (All my homies)
For jakkaz only, from ?twip?, to the fools in L.A. that know me
I'm back wit' a fifth of Henn'
Kurupt and Dat Nigga Daz on the mash again"
Big Boi	26	Toilet Tisha	Stankonia	2000	[Verse 2]	"Five thousand, one hundred ten days is a short period of time
A mere fourteen years on this precious mother earth
You see Tisha had issues
And her decision making skills were still in its early stages
You know what I'm talking about
Therefore she could not properly handle a blessing in which
She thought to be an obstacle in her path to adulthood
Pause, Just like a brother with a thousand pauses
Should I, shouldn't I, I can't, I have to, Mama will never see me the same
Daddy and Big Mama I know all of them gonna be ashamed of me
Are just a few thoughts racing through her cranium
As she sits on top of the pale, cold porcelain seat in the rear of the house
The unthinkable moments away from becoming reality, sadly with no clue
And no way of expressing her feelings to her mama or anybody else in her life
Tisha done came to the crossroads and now she got to choose
Fatality, fatality, fatality, fatality"

Big Boi	26	13th Floor/Growing Old	ATLiens	1996	[Verse 2]	"Uhh, born Antwan Patton but my partners they call me Big Boi
It's the nigga the B-I-G, be speaking the truth not talking that shit boy
I'm thinking of checking my traps and busting my raps
And throwing them craps
7 Eleven is no convenience, you pumping your gas but watching your back
For the robbing crew; thinking they're robbing you, you must be cautious
To staying up on your game and pimping these crows, you must be flawless
Like Mortal Kombat, but fucking these wombats got you dizzy
My nigga you know if I wanna be playin
But runnin up on me like you miss me
You catching the wrong vibe, packing your shit and rolling your eyes back
Flexin up on the corner tossin your dice and rollin your Cadillac
But man it seems I'm reaching out and touching the wrong nigga
Don't expect it to be pimping get your index off the trigger
As we bust, us, we leavin em in the dust
So keep that caine up out of your nose
I said my piece and then I hush
As the calendar keeps flippin', niggas dippin'
(""Ninety-six gonna be that year""...)"
Nas	9	Memory Lane (Sittin’ In Da Park)	Illmatic	1994	[Verse 2]	"One for the money
Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God
Check the prognosis — is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama
For real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis; my razor embraces many faces
Your telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic, automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed, so
My pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin' — some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say ""Peace""
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin
Yo, fuck, rap is real Watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes 'cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my vein
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane"
Kendrick Lamar	16	heart pt. 6	GNX	2024	[Verse 1]	"Load up the Pro Tools and press three
Studio filled with Jack In The Box and Pepsis
Niggas watchin' WorldStar videos, not the ESPYs
Laughin' at B. Pumper, stomach turnin', I get up and proceeded to write somethin'
Ab-Soul in the corner mumblin' raps, fumblin' packs of Black & Milds
Crumblin' kush 'til he cracked a smile
His words legendary, wishin' I could rhyme like him
Studied his style to define my pen
That was back when the only goal was to get Jay Rock through the door
Warner Brother Records, hope Naim Ali would let us know
Was excited just to go to them label meetings
Wasn't my record deal, but still, I couldn't beliеve it
Me and Rock inside thе booth hibernatin'
It was simple math, if he made it, that mean I made it
Everything I had was for the team, I remained patient
Grindin' with my brothers, it was us against them, no one above us, bless our hearts"
50 Cent	19	My Toy Soldier	The Massacre	2005	[Outro]	"Yeah!

Snoop Dogg	0	Up Jump tha Boogie	Tha Doggfather	1996	[Chorus]	"Up jump tha boogie to the bang bang boogie

Future & Metro Boomin	32	Seen it All	WE DON’T TRUST YOU	2024	[Chorus]	"Me and my brothers, we puttin' freaks in rotation
Sometimes they move on, they still can't replace
I'll lose a stone and get it replaced the same day
From trappin' out my granny house to rappin' on the stage
I want it all, I know these streets gon' have to feed me
These hoes sit down, I'm lettin' 'em hit it off the whole key
Got rich in this shit, got a clip hold a fifty
You tryna keep up with me, gon' be O-V (Ah)"
Guru	20	In This Life...	The Ownerz	2003	[Verse 1]	"From New York to Cali it remains the same
Bitch niggas always wanna go against the grain
The strong will survive, the weak shall perish
Y'all need more courage, I keep y'all nourished
Get in line, I let you know right now
You need to slow right down or you get blown right now
From what I see it's systematic how we push to addicts
Demographics make the street life hell or drastic
In the hood we see effects of genocide
'Cause if it's on it's on, you know at least 10 men'll ride
But on the other side, corruption runs deep
I'm aware of the conspiracies, discussion is brief
They're building more prisons, spendin less on schools
On the block Smith & Wessons and Teflons rule
It's hard to escape it, certain laws are sacred
In this life my nigga, it's mad hard to make it"

Not positive, who's the best, Pac, Nas and B.I.G.?
Ain't no best, east, west, north, south, flossed out
Greetings, I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts left, chest, face gone
How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage (Uh)
Burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne
I got this locked since '91 (Uh), I am the truest
Name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters, but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame, kept my name in his music, check it"

Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still'll take you down right on your mama couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy

Big Boi	26	Slump	Aquemini	1998	[Verse 2]	"Shit, cops and robbers, niggas be bound to get them dollars and cents
They get in a slump like baseball players when they short on they rent
Anything goin', you ain't knowin' how much money you spent
But in the real world you surrounded by these ladies and gents
Who hang around you 'cause you be buyin' all the weed and all the chicken
Feedin' everybody, smokin' 'em out
When you was broke, though, they was missin'
Now you ridin' 'bout four deep, startin' to tear up your suspension
And your baby mama on child support, my fault, forgot to mention
You don't even have a checking account wasn't thinking about no pension
I used to work at Steak 'N' Ale, Old Gold off in the kitchen
Had determination and graduated, now I got the whole rap world fascinated
I wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so I made it
Continue to sell dope, it's payin' the bills so you gon' do it
But legislation got this new policy: three strikes and you're ruined
Now where your crew at? Yeah"

Who keep 'em honest like us?
Who in alignment like us?
Who gotta heal 'em all? Us (Us)
When there's no one to call us (Us)"

Travis Scott	33	MY EYES	UTOPIA	2023	[Verse]	"Look in my eyes, tell me your tale
Do you see the road, the map to my soul?
Look, tell me the signs whenever the smoke clear out of my face
Am I picture-perfect or do I look fried?
All of that green and yellow, that drip from your eyes is tellin'
Tell you demise, I went to my side
To push back the ceilin' and push back the feelings, I had to decide
I replay them nights, and right by my side, all I see is a city of people that ride wit' me
If they just knew what Scotty would do to jump off the stage and save him a child
The things I created became the most weighted, I gotta find balance and keep me a smile (Hah)
Yeah, yeah
That shit wild, instead I'm a hero
I took it from zero, LaFlame Usain
I run it for miles, this shit wasn't luck
They got me fucked up, I put you on bus and take you around
A couple of guys inside of the school, I gave 'em the tools to get it off ground
They say they the ones when they make the errors
Can't look in the mirror (That shit wild)
I stand on the stage, I give 'em the rage
No turnin' it down, can't tame it, can't follow it
We do in the streets, we do it for keeps
We do it for rights, got fifty-two weeks
This shit ain't for pleasure, I'm comin' to tweak
This shit is forever and infinity
Number eight, yeah, we write it and wrap it around
I take me a bean and I turn to a beast
Bought the crib on a hill, made it harder to reach
Bought a couple more whips 'cause I needed more speed
Bought a couple more watches, I needed more time
Didn't buy the condo, it was smarter to lease
And I bought some more ice 'cause I brought in the heat
Made a cast of my dick, so she never gon' cheat
If I gave you a day in my life or a day in my eyes, don't blink"
Nas	9	Let There Be Light	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Verse 3]	"The son of the audio cassette era, TEC wearer
Bullets and baguettes, Benz Bose Speaker Terror
Deman I get mine till I'm dead, so I can drive somethin' red
Like that horse standing on its hind legs
Since Arnold and Willis in they bunk beds
I wanted bread like Wonder
Not Ned the Wino like the parents of Lionel
Nas is the Ghetto American Idol
No matter what you do you're never getting my title
I can't sound smart 'cause y'all will run away
They say I ain't hungry no more and I don't talk about yay
Like there's no other way for a ex-hustler
Cake getter, ex-wig splitter to touch ya, I beg to differ
When you're four years into the game
We can have a conversation
Eight years in the game, I invite you on vacation
Ten years in the game, after I've enjoyed my fame
Only then I let you pick my brain, niggas"
Kanye West	5	Get Em High	The College Dropout	2004	[Verse 1]	"My flow is in the pocket like wallets, I got the bounce like hydraulics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alcoholics

'Til I built up the nerve to drop my ass up out of college
My teacher said I's a loser, I told her, ""Why don't you kill me?
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna follow
My heart"", and if you follow the charts
Or the plaques or the stacks, you ain't gotta guess who's back, you see?
I'm so Chi' that you thought I was bashful
But this bastard's flow will bash your skull
And I will cut your girl like Pastor Tro'
And I don't usually smoke, but pass the 'dro
And I won't give you that money that you askin' for
Why you think me and Dame cool? We assholes
That's why we hear your music and fast forward
'Cause we don't wanna hear that weak shit no mo'"

Check, one, two and you don't stop
Your head'll bop when I drop my crop of pure bomb
Just like the seashore, I'm calm but wild
With my monotone style
Because I don't need gimmicks
Give me a fly beat and I'm all in it
Word is bond, I go on and on
For you, it's tragic, I got magic like wands
So I'ma end this lecture and I bet ya
Those who kick dirt, in due time, I'm gonna get ya

Any play the sweetest melody the street ever heard
Now bitches sucking on my nouns and I'm eating their verbs
Get full, and niggas, niggas
Pop, pop, lock, lock to the, to the beat, beat
As if pitbulls went out of style, made a vow to myself
If it's for the wealth I'll stop, well put it like this
It's like me selling some dope because my girlfriend wants to shop
Wrong reason, whatever the season, hey winter, spring, summer or fall
I dont stall, slow drag wit' your brain against the wall
Yeah, nigga, naw, we lean to the side don't fall
All y'all fuckboys, tuck toys inside your pants
Just to pull it out, point it at the ground and make a nigga wanna dance

Talking loud talking bout that's gangsta shit"

Out of sight, out of mind, naw dawg, it's not me
I miss you, you on my mind daily
Even though I scribe to a nigga, really, you feel me

Reading ya letters, I see you ain't lose ya sense of humour
Talkin' to you on the phone made my day cooler
Tellin' me, how you duff the COs out
You need to bring your black ass home and cut that bullshit out
I could remember me and Killa used to test our new guns in the projects
Cause that's where police won't come
Illa Ghee, my nigga 'till death do us
You almost home, until then, hold ya head, dunn"

Write to make it right, don't like where I be
I'd like to make it like the sights on TV
Quite the great life, so nice and easy.""
Sí, now you can still die from that
But it's better than not being alive from straps
Agreed, a Mead notebook and a Bic that click when it's pushed
And a wack ass beat
That's a track that's weak that he got last week
'Cause everybody in the stu' was like, ""That's that heat!""
A bass-heavy medley with a sample from the '70s
With a screwed-up hook that went ""Stack that cheese!""
Somethin', somethin', somethin', ""Stack that cheese!""
Mother, sister, cousin, ""Stack that cheese!""
He couldn't think of nothin', ""Stack that cheese!""
He turns down the beat, writer's block impedes
Crying from the next room, a baby in need
Of some Pampers and some food and a place to sleep
That, plus a black Cadillac on D's
Is what keep him on track to be a great MC (Yeah)"

When my cats attack, you got your knot split, ayo

Either fuck with it or don't fuck with it
Catch us in a middle of the crowd crazily bent

We out to win and that's it
We out to win it like this"
Big Boi	26	Tomb of the Boom	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse 6]	"Fourth and goal
Should I take the three-point field goal for the score?
Or should I roll?
Around and take the ball up the middle
The gut, the what? The hole
Cranium overload, overthrowed
Now we got seven more
Points on the board, fa' sho'
B-I-G B-O-I, me, oh, my, I think He's blessin' me
Excelling in harmonious melody, boy we got the recipe
Like Ragu, it's in there, giving you some of the best of me
Playa-pimp-gangsta-poet
We gon' spit it, we gon' show it to your ass
""You're a champion"" were my dad's last words before he passed
But I know one day, we will once more cross paths
They say, ""Big Boi, can you pull it off without your nigga Dre?""
I say, ""People, stop the madness, 'cause me and Dre, we okay""
OutKast: ""Cell Therapy"" to cell division
We done split it down the middle so you can see both the visions
Been spittin' damn near ten years—why the fuck would we be quittin'?
Fuck nigga"

Come through your strip frontin', stuntin', it's something you want
745, chrome spinners, haters hate that I'm winning
Man, I've been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
'Cause I can't control my temper, I'm finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand, homie, I'm down to get it poppin'
Once I squeeze the first shot, you know I ain't stoppin'

Hollow tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smoking, still locing

Around this time, I was spinnin' records at Eve After Dark

Same chalk police used to outline niggas we lost
You understand what I'm sayin'? Shit is crazy, man
Fuck the money, yo, this shit could never change me, man
These new niggas in this bitch could never phase me, man
I know it's strange, but on some real shit, it's plain as day

If I'm faking, I'm Clay Aiken
You ain't 50 and you ain't Game, you lame, you're tame, bitch
You're mild sauce, you ain't ready to make that flame switch
You'll end up in the same situation, same shit
Different day, just with different gangstas in your face, which
Way do you wanna face when your brain's hit pavement?
Think of what you'll say to Pastor Mase and save it
For the day that they got them affidavits waving
In my face, looking for answers, rap sensation
Eminem battles to ward off accusations
That he had somebody blasted, the mask of Jason
Was found at the scene of the task with masking tape
And the victim's penis up his ass, a basket case
And they ask him to clean up his act, you bastards wasting
Too much time, me no kiss ass, and if that's the case then
We ain't going!"

Big Boi	26	SpottieOttieDopaliscious	Aquemini	1998	[Verse 3]	"Yes! When I first met my SpottieOttieDopalicious angel
I can remember that damn thing like yesterday
The way she moved reminded me of a brown stallion horse with skates on, you know?
Smooth, like a hot comb on nappy-ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece, just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes, you dig?
One moment, you frequent the booty clubs, and the next four years, you and somebody's daughter raisin' y'all own young'n
Now, that's a beautiful thang
That's if you're on top of your game and man enough to handle real-life situations, that is
Can't gamble feeding a baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient
But the United Parcel Service and the people at the post office didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now, you back in the trap
Just that: trapped!
Go'n' and marinate on that for a minute"

But sometimes, it's like that I love me more
I love the peace, and I love the war
I love the seas, and I love the shore
No love for no beach; baby, that's law
But she doesn't see, therefore I spoil
I trick, I fall, run up in raw
I love her with all my heart
Every vein, every vessel, every bullet lodged
With every flower that I ever took apart
She said that she would give me greatness, status
Placement above the others
My face would grace covers of the magazines of the hustlers
Paper, the likes of which that I had never seen
Her eyes glow green with the logo of our dreams
The purpose of our scene, an obscene obsession for the bling
She would be my queen, I could be her king, together
She would make me cool, and we would both rule, forever
And I would never feel pain
And never be without pleasure, ever again
And if the rain stops, and everything's dry
She would cry just so I can drink the tears from her eyes
She'd teach me how to fly, even cushion my fall
If my engines ever stall and I plummet from the sky
But she will keep me high, and if I ever die
She would commission monuments on her bosom to him
Or maybe she'd retire as well
A match made in Heaven set the fires in Hell, and I'll be"

We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody
We're just some niggas who're on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic, we rock the mic (Right)
For all my dogs keepin' y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
'Cause it's cool when you cause the cozy condition
In which we create  'cause that's our mission
So listen close to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every day
I woke up around ten o'clock in the morning
I gave myself a stretch up, a morning yawn, and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands upon a cup
And said, ""Um, mirror mirror, on, the wall
Who is the top dog of them all?""
There was a ruffle duffle, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, ""You are, you conceited bastard""
Well, that's true, that's why we never have no beef
So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay 'cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file for my fingernails
I'm true to the style on my behalf
I put the bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean, dry, was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnson's Baby Powder and Cool Water cologne
Now I'm fresh, dressed like a million bucks
Threw on my white socks with my all-blue Chucks
Stepped out the house, stopped short, ""Oh no""
I went back in, ""I forgot my Indo""
Then I dilly (Dally) I ran through a (Alley)
I bumped into this smoker named (Sally) from the (Valley)
This was a girl playing hard to get

She said, um"

It's almost four in the mornin' and you're in a
Nightmare, it's horrible, right there's the coroner
Waiting for ya to turn the corner so he can corner ya
You're a goner, he's onto ya
Out the corner of his cornea, he just saw ya run
All you want is to rest 'cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
Here I sit, while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowin' a Klonopin while I'm noddin' in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn, holding onto the pill bottle, then
Lick my finger and swirl it 'round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at McDonald's with
Blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must've just blacked out again—not again"
Eminem	15	Bad Guy	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Outro]	"So, one last time, I'm back
'Fore it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable;
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
Uh, as we pick up where the last Mathers left off"
Eminem	15	We Made You	Relapse	2009	[Verse 3]	"Damn, girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal, but
Jessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (Blup!)
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
""Lord, help us, he's back in his pink ALF shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!""
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate
Now break it down, girl"

Eric B. & Rakim	14	Relax With Pep	Don’t Sweat the Technique	1992	[Verse 2]	"I enchant a riot with a quiet storm
Is it the way I parlay or the knowledge being born?
All praises due to the magnificent, most high and magnificent
From him, I was sent with intent
To invent new ways for better displays for better days
No more crimes, I got rhymes and it pays
I'm prepared to take mine and get mine
And I can protect mine either with a rhyme or a nine
A silent rage but if amplified
Rhymes multiply, it's hard to provoke when I
Put a mode in effect, the episode's correct
Reload and you don't know what code to respect
I get swift and changeable, adapt and master
But still remaindable, rap gets faster
Reacts and projects, attracts and it get
To the max, it's in depth, it attacks but it's relaxed with pep"

So this about cleanin' up house, my own backyard
Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed
P, how many times ain't you shamed that
Jungle was bustin' his gun to get your weak chain back
They don't respect you, a check's due for me for your fame
Mega, I hope you blow so I'm sayin' your name (Mega, Mega)
Hoes play your position 'cause you'll never be King
Even Jigga want the crown, ""How that sound?"" Poor thing

All you little roaches and rats
Besides my man Ricky, Nas the true ruler is back

For me to twist shit, switch and rip shit the fuck up like The Shining

You think you saw, but death is all around like a ghost town
Perhaps you, know I acts a fool if I have to
Can you comprehend or adapt to?"

Just get a lil head then I let my man fuck 'em, it's nothing
You give her the money to shop for the crib
How you think see get to see me, you watchin' the kids
My man, you won't catch me all emotional and mushy
'Cause I don't get pussy whipped, I whip on pussy

But you can't make a ho a housewife (Wife)"
Eminem	15	Sing for the Moment	The Eminem Show	2002	[Verse 2]	"Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely, 'cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Uh-huh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great (Ugh)
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So, I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, b'
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you (Bitch)"

I'm too persistent, plus I flow too vicious
'Bout to expose you hoes, this shit is too twisted
Rappers be actin' like they rich or somethin'
When they get robbed like a herb, that's what they get for frontin'

You're mediocre son, you're barely average kid
Your style's Chi-Chi, wanna see me crack yo' cabbage kid?

Tryna intrude on the caper, who the hell can relate ta THAT!?

Understand this motherfuckin' G-pack in my hand
Look what happened to San Fran
Young girl hit by policeman
Twelve shots up in her dome, damn
Niggas thought we slept but the architect sent
The Pentagon's from Egypt, government secret
The 99 to 2-G computer shutdown, what now
Extension on Earth, human cutdown
Niggas play with PlayStations, they build a spacestations
On Mars, plottin' civilizations

In time brother, you will discover the light
Some say that God is Black and the devil's White
Well, the devil is wrong and God is what's right
I fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear
The rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear
As a child, given religion with no answer to why
Just told believe in Jesus cause for me he did die
Curiosity killed the catechism
Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to
And became a slave to master self
A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health
My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons
Qur'an and the Bible, to me they all vital
And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys
You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief
But one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em
And use religion as an emblem
When it should be a natural way of life
Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right
That's who got you doing right and got you this far
Whether you say ""in Jesus name"" or ""Hum do Allah""
Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you
You let that show towards others in the things you do

Funny, we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid?

But I don't want it back — ""Yes, you do,"" — no, I don't
""Yes, you do! You're gonna regret it later,"" — no, I won't
""I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the Doctor""
Go ahead, I already talked to Dre yesterday
""Well, I got him on the phone right now!""
() You're lying! How, why now?
What up, Dre?
But Dre, all Shady is, is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
() — fuck this mirror!

Fuck you! Die, you son of a bitch!
""Put the gun down!"" — bye-bye! Boom!
Okay, I'm still alive, — ""So am I too!
You can't kill a spirit even if you tried to
Ha-ha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?
You remember that night you
Prayed to God you'd give anything to get a record deal? Well, Dre signed you
This is what you wanted your whole life, Marshall, right? Ooh
Look at this house, look at these cars: they're so nice, woo!
Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too?
That you just now seeing the downside to
Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too
Ain't even sure if your kids like you
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without NyQuil
Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle

50 Cent	19	Position of Power	The Massacre	2005	[Verse 1]	"I come through your hood, stuntin' in my yellow Lam'
Murcielago, top down, nigga damn
I'm the biggest crook from New York since Son of Sam
Cruising, bumping Buck's shit, Ruger in my hand
Thinking the East ain't enough, it's time to expand
I plan to head out West and plant my feet down
A nigga big as King Kong in the street now
I do a little house shopping, and buy me a crib
It's palm trees and pretty bitches out in Cali kid
I touch the Hollywood paper, go and shoot me some flicks
Have some supermodel bitches come and suck on some dick
Mama'd turn in her grave if I married a white chick
But Becky'll suck the chrome off a Chevy and shit
Niggas be wearing fake shines, I'm rocking a lil' charm
30 carats on the pinky, kiss the ring on the Don
Crack open that Cali bud, stuff the weed in the palm"
The Game	13	Special	The Documentary	2005	[Verse 3]	"Let me tell you 'bout the birds and bees
How I stand on the block all day and flip birds and ki's
Your boyfriend don't like me, cause he don't get a fourth of my cheese
And you can take back the Porsche and his keys
Hop in the Range Rover, you ain't gotta force him to leave
I got a chrome four-four in my jeans
You got Gucci frames coverin the mark on your face
Cause he don't want you to leave, and I don't want you to stay
Sometimes I wanna snatch that nigga out his CLK
I know he treatin you the way K-Ci did Mary J
I wanna, ease your pain, kick off your Louis sandals
Let me, wipe your tears with my G-Unit bandana
You make me wanna peel you out them jeans when you rockin them
It's ""Me & My Girlfriend"" like 2Pac and them
Jay-Z and Beyonce, or Bobby and Whitney
We the 0-5 Bonnie and Clyde, feel me?"

JAY-Z	6	Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)	Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life	1998	[Verse 1]	"From standin' on the corners, boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
From droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2
Y'all niggas get ready!"

Future	30	Everyday Hustle	WE DON’T TRUST YOU	2024	[Verse 3]	"Fightin' for your life, spin by the hospital
Bare-faced just like I'm lil' Critter
Body snatchers, wig splitters, cap peelers, gravediggers, snake niggas
Ain't nobody safe, nigga
Meet me at the nearest coke spot
Middle of the slums, standin' at the boat dock
Loadin' up the cash, move it in the U-Haul
Went inside my bag, went and took a roof off
Crash dummy, goin' retarded, spendin' cash on it
Smashin' in a Demon, still'll smash a European
Gold-diggin' bitches, you can't tell a nigga shit
He just got his first wish, can't tell these lil' niggas shit
Tryna put him on some game, you better put him on a hit
Livin' in the trenches, it's survival of the fittest
Thirty milligrams, niggas rather take the fent'
Niggas got it out the mud, it's codeine when you piss
Drop a brick in the toilet, he ain't talkin' 'bout shit
Drop a brick in the toilet, he ain't talkin' 'bout shit"
Dr. Dre	1	Bang Bang	2001	1999	[Verse 1]	"Everyday it's the same thing, L.A. ain't changed
Niggas still playa hating, but Dre ain't changed
I'm just a lot smarter now
Cause these niggas is banging ten times harder now
Niggas bringing they ass up in the wrong part of town
Better turn their car around
Rolling the window down
(Nah, get the fuck out!)
Johnny got a shotgun
And he ain't even strong enough to cock one
Fuck trying to job hunt
Niggas got AK's
Niggas is way crazier than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days
Niggas spray strays and shoot without looking
Niggas walk by and blast, without leaving a footprint
I think the attitudes are twice as worst
It takes half the time to get your whole life reversed
Always trying to play Rambo with they ammo
Make a nigga wanna stay in family mode"

Watchin' Bonnie and Clyde, pretendin' to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand, sayin', ""Let me see that clip""
Shopping sprees, pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor, but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick, let me see, that's it
It was the cheese, helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin' they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed-out buggy
And then they got fuzzy, and they don't remember that
And I don't remember you"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	The Punisher	Don’t Sweat the Technique	1992	[Verse 2]	"I hold the mic as hostage, MC's as ransom
Rhymes'll punish 'em 'cause they don't understand 'em
I heat up his brain, then explain that I hand him
A red-hot microphone... that's how I brand 'em
Rhymes fall in formation, unite and ignite
Like a platoon puttin' bullet wounds in the mic
If ya curse me, it ain't no mercy
Give 'em an autopsy, killed by versin' me
I took a kid and cut off his eyelids
Killin' him slow so he could see what I did
And if he don't understand what I said
I'm pushin' his eyeballs wayyyy to the back of his head
So he can see what he's gettin' into
A part of the mind that he never been through
A journey is comin' 'cause ya gettin' sent to
A place harder to find, but it's all in the mental
I run a brain scan to locate his game plan
When I'm through with his brain, he ain't the same man
Did he lose his mind or lost in his mind?
But this ain't the lost and found because ya can't find
Your foundation, coastin'
Your mind is driftin' in slow motion... frozen
Looks like another murder at the Mardi Gras, B
Too late to send out a search party
Once ya out of ya head, then ya can't get back
I give him a map, but he still get trapped
So prepare the chamber, the torture's comin' up
Trip through the mind, at the end you'll find it's The Punisher!
Kill 'em again!"

Common	22	They Say	Be	2005	[Verse 1]	"They say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin' Derick, ""Tell Cara get us a show""
Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man ain't necessarily the nigga with dough
They say ""You went wild"", yeah, that's what they say
My niggas couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray
Paintin' a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say ""Dope is sour, so it's homework and hood crimes""
I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye
They never could say, tell 'em, J"

In the bathroom sweatin' with her ass up

We had chemistry cause she was a Cancer
Thought forever it would last for
But forever move faster, so I had to
() Still I gotta pause
When I think about her in them draws
() And uh, ooh baby she liked it raw and
Like rain when she came it poured

Down through the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid and (Pew!)
Out through China, nearly misses airliners
Magnified times five, this was pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze (Woo!)
Now, that's important to say
'Cause even with all that, most of us don't want it to fade
We want it to braid
Meaning we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called, and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair, put him back in his cage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gon' clap, and they ain't gon' praise (Uh)
They want everything back (Back) that they've paid
'Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim

First rule of war, you find an act on her

When you hustle, always make it fancy
The signal's far from what you can be

God bless the dead and let Biggie possess the pencil lead
They called me a sped and said that I had a messed up head
'Cause I said, ""Motherfuck school,"" and instead went to special ed
Sippin' Bacardi and lime I start to recollect on the time
That I startled my mom and had her scared to death
Word to Method Man
She heard some Wu-Tang coming from towards the patio
She was like, ""What the heck was that?""
She went to check on the noise and go inspect the deck
Then I jumped out with a sword and yelled, ""Protect your neck""
Now bow to the Lord, hold up, no, better yet, kneel
Better yet, get down on all fours and take a vow to always
Rejoice in the sound of my voice, but you don't have a choice
Just a third of my will will overpower yours
Using about a fourth to create the amount of force
It'll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of Tylenol
Enter my house of horrors with a thousand floors
Got a crown of thorns, but it won't fit around the horns
But I'ma keep it a buck like a dollar store
I'm more than you bargained for and I am far more worse
Than a forty-some bar Lord Jamar verse
Nothing means more than respect, so when I curse
You could say I swore to protect
My image, I have zero time or regard for
A never-was, been claiming rap when it's not yours
If it was anyone's house, G Rap and Rakim would be havin' you mop floors
Run-DMC would be havin' you cleanin' sinks
Yeah, your group was off the chain, but you were the weakest link
Rest of these youngins of mine
Time to start throwing some shade, this time I'm shutting the blinds
'Cause when I'm looking at y'all, shit, it's no wonder it's why
I need a visor, 'cause y'all are just sons in my eyes
Born a cynic and more demented than an orphanage with a morgue up in it
Next door to an abortion clinic
Newborn infants tortured and tormented
With their foreheads dented when they drop 'cause the floor's cemented
Their corpses get ornamented
The coroner with a storage bin rented
To store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin'
Distorted, twisted, this isn't no storybook ending
This is only the beginning
So, Lord, forgive me, I'm hearing voices
I can't ignore them anymore, they're winning"

Damn, niggas switching sides on niggas just like that
You know me, I stay with a bitch on her knees
And give guns away in the hood like it's government cheese
Spray off Suzukis, eleven hundred CC's
No plate on the back, straight squeezing the MAC
In the hood, they identify niggas by they cars
So I switch up whips to stay off the radar

Last name was English, and the first name Olde
But Gold couldn't take the dick, it made me lazy

Now me and Dainy, we been together ever since
Our love combines to form a science, what is this?
I bust her cherry, took her virginity in '91 (Word)
Now that she's open, everybody want to tap somethin'
Go get your own, don't make me have to fuckin' clap somethin'
I love my shorty more than life, now ain't that somethin'?
To love you, Dainy, more than livin' itself
Even though my friends tell me she ain't good for my health
When I go pick her up, they tell me, ""Put her back on the shelf""
They say, ""Yo, P! She only wants you for one thing — that's your wealth""
But I don't pay attention, 'cause she's my baby, the Dainy
You know she drive me crazy, she's my number one lady
Met her back in '89, now she's 22, actin' like she 40 (Word)

Hennessy raps, we like the Phantom
Running you up out of the spot in which you standin'
Never second-guess a cat who hold gat
Concealed, but easily revealed if that's
Body casting raps to get your back snapped in half and severed
Impossible pain beyond measure
Shiesty living brought him to his last prayer (Prayer)
Life changed around quick with one stare (Stare)
Face full of fear, conquering your ice grill (Grill)
Drowsiness, put him to sleep like NyQuil (NyQuil)
Given a overdose of this rap potent
Potentially dangerous, fatally left open
For the vultures, scavengers, that's EMS
Funeral homes anticipating your death
That's the dead truth, check in the morgue, you'll find proof
Enough to make you think and stop before your ship sink

Fuck a honey dip.. cause I got money to get
Ain't no books, ain't no help, ain't no role to this
Stay focused young homey, that's the code to this
Keep a strap in ya pocket when you trip through the towns
There's a million motherfuckers tryna get you down
A lot of pain in this game, cocaine is the thang
If ya money right then you might get you a chain
But if ya money is low, there's only one way to go
Jack a rapper at a local rap radio show
So mean, so green, crip back to the block
Then brag to the homies, show 'em what you got
It's a gangsta jack (gangsta jack), in gangsta black (black)
And they thought we just gangsta rapped
Yeah nigga, we take your snaps
Your shooby dooby, hooroobies, and your Scooby snacks (It's like that?)

Guru	20	Brainstorm	Hard to Earn	1994	[Verse 1]	"One, two, check
I get down and dirty and my sounds are worthy of respect
So I'ma flex my text just like a major takeover
Chumps pass the mic over
Growin' more and more nervous when I serve this ass whoopin'
Comin' straight out of Brooklyn, baldhead from the old school
Born to rule with more class than Billy Dee
To a pussy MC, you know, a wuss MC
I'm like his worst nightmare when I'm on my killing spree
Pick the vic', who will it be?
Your vote may hold the key
It's up to you, tell us true
Who'll be herb of the day?
And when you fake, you break
When suckers choose, they lose
I'm like lethal to you and your people
It's like an outrage when punks step on stage
With the weak show, weak flow, and still make dough
So I'ma take dough from 'em and then son 'em
Teach 'em how to really get biz like this
Me and my gang's gonna swarm

Anything less than the best is blasphemy
So ask for me - when you wanna get spliffted
I'm not Keith Murray but I'll Get Ya Lifted
Terrific, cause this is just the linguistics
This shit's cannibalistic, so I mixed it and twisted
With the berries and cherries, the high berries
The aura is horror, man this shit is so scary!

Speeches I prepared that I never spoke

From stories that I heard, I'm just like you, nigga
Must've been some pain in your past, too
Must've been a karma that was past due
Must it be the energy that passed through
Must've been a pastor, many snafus
Started a good man, you married my mama
I was in her belly, you hurried that Summer
She had two kids from a previous mister
One family, I don't believe in half-sisters
Never treated my brother like a step, Pop
Remembered the many lessons when we stepped out"

I went to 20 funerals by the age of 19
Then I went to college, basketball was my dream
Quit the team, 'cause I'd rather shoot rock with the fiends
Wanted to be Freeway Rick
He showed me how to turn a stolen 5.0 into a brick
Bought a Cadillac, thought I was rich, bangin' DJ Quik
On Crenshaw got jacked for my shit
Took a long chronic hit, and thought about the time
When I was 12 years old and I emptied my first clip
Hit my first switch, same night fucked my first bitch
Thought I was dreamin 'til I pinched her tits
She caught a stray bullet ridin' shotgun in my shit
So I got her name tatted in (Old English)"

My daughter pass it onto the next generation
Throwing carnations at my tombstone
In my new home, meet Mom's in my Yves Saint Laurent suit on
Then we do a dance
Like my man Luther jam, but my verse came first
I stole change out her purse, now I wanna dig her up
Outta the earth, too morbid, lean forward
Toward a new paragraph, Blue carrots, D-class
Strictly that kush in the weed bags
Tryna' figure out what Barry Gordie had put in production
Studio's smokey now, hard like David Ruffin
Hit a spliff through a seance, and uh, play on, playa"

I said, ""Excuse me, why you tryin' to rob me?""
He had the nerve to say I had a curfew (Do you know what time it is?)
Get out the car or I'll hurt you (Get out the fucking car, or I'll hurt you)
So here I go, I better make my mind up
Pick my nine up or hit the line-up
I chose B, stepped into the streets
The first cop grabbed me, the other ripped my seat
They grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete (Ayy, man, ayo, ayy, man, just come on)
(What you doin man?) They tried to frame me
They tried to say I had some dope in the back seat
But I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend
My homie panicked (I'm out), he tried to run (Freeze, nigga)
I heard a bullet fire from the cop's gun
My homie dropped, so I hit the cop
I kept swingin', yo, I couldn't stop
Before I knew it, I was beatin' the cop senseless
The other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless
Now I'm against this cop who was racist
Givin' him a taste of trading places
And all this 'cause the peckerwood was tryin' this
Frame up, but I came up
Now they claimin' that I'm violent"

Cause a prostitute sucking dick in the hallway
Little Caesar's never sending pizza out y'all way
Papa Johns never get delivered where y'all stayed
The ghetto was a physical manifestation
Of hate in a place where ethnicity determines your placement
A place that defines your station
Remind you niggas your  place is the basement
White people in the attic
Niggas selling dope, White people is the addicts
White folks act like they ain't show us how to traffic
All that dope to China, you don't call that trappin'?
Breaking Bad, learned that from a TV
So don't say it's politics when you see me
When you gon' apologize for your CD

Oh shit, 2Pacalypse is back and strapped
Attackin' the packs, I’m kickin' the facts on stacks of raps
And those that max, relax, and let the Blacks get jack
Are gettin' taxed, by packs and packs of angry Blacks
I'm ready to go, I'm rippin' the shows
Hittin' the door, gettin' the hoes, clothes
Pumpin' the funk, thanks to the Hump, 'cause the nose knows
Check the pose, froze when you see me close
Punks, you gonna roast, hopes in a cloud of smoke
Broke, choked on some potent dank smoke
Wrote rhymes that'll bring me bank notes
Nope, I ain't the type of fella that you're used to
Ki-Ki-Ki-Kickin' the funky flava, pumpin' the juice with dope producers
Run for cover when you hear the bass drum

Something wicked this way comes (Ruthless, come, come)
Ruthless, come, come"

Switched up the number, I can't be bothered
I cannot blame you for havin' an angle
I ain't got no issues, I'm just doin' my thing
Hope you're doin' your thing, too
I'm a deadbeat cousin, I hate family reunions
Fuck the church up by drinkin' at the communion
Spillin' free wine, now my tux is ruined
In town for a day, what the fuck we doin'?
Who your real friends? We all came from the bottom
I'm always blamin' you, but what's sad, you not the problem
Damn, I forgot to call her, shit, I thought it was Thursday
Why you wait a week to call my phone in the first place?
When was the last time I remembered a birthday?
When was the last time I wasn't in a hurry? Uh"

Had to cuss my mama out, she said get a job, get up off yo ass
Now just relax my nigga, picture me rollin' down Compton Boulevard
With a chopper on my lap, now repost that my nigga
Don't make me DM your BM, she wanna see him cause he win whatever he in
Park a Bugatti at my mama house
They ain't even payin' rent, livin' sugar free
I'm just a hood nigga, all I wanna do is buy swishers
Take pictures while I'm fucking on these bitches
Hittin' switches while I'm dippin'
Red Cup full of betchu can't kill it
Three wheelin' and I bet I won't spill it
Not one drip
Been driving through Compton all day ain't got sweated by one Crip

On the flow from the cops with wings on your back

Phony niggas walk around, tryna be your clone
They really fear you, when you was at home, they was pale
That's why they wanna see you either dead or in jail
By the time you hear this rhyme, you'll probably be locked up
Tried to hide, somewhere along the lines, your plans slipped up
Got caught up in a crime that you can't take back
Reminiscin' how I used to pick you up in the Ac'
Years ago, when we was younger
Seemed the hood took us under very deep
Wonderin' who snitchin' got me losin lots of sleep at night
You know my mouth is tight
I never sang to the cops 'cause that shit ain't right!
Sometimes, I stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack
Damn! Why the situation go down like that?
It'll be a long time before the heat dies down
And a couple of years 'fore we see you around
But 'til then, maintain and keep your story the same
The cops is grabbin' wrong niggas, lookin' for someone to blame
They harassin', strugglin' to find the truth
There's a chance ya case'll get thrown out 'cause they ain't got no proof
To say you're guilty, your fingerprints filthy
Deliver me the gun, I'll tie it to a brick and throw it in the river
Make sure it sinks to the bottom
Outsmart police, snuck you out the projects, we got 'em!

I'll put it on his ass 'cause he's bigger
Then worry about the other three niggas
All of them ran to get backup
That's twelve more niggas I'ma stack up
Opened up the trunk in a rage
And loaded up my goddamn twelve gauge
If the punk don't keep ya
I'll be forced to hit ya with the street sweeper
Your ass shouldn't a started no static, G
Twelve gunshots automatically
I ain't goin' out like no sucker
I'm goin' out like a crazy motherfucker
Everybody knows that I ain't got it all
And I don't give a fuck about none of y'all

Man, you seen it all before, you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls, so you know who did it
You know you with it, girl, don't front, oh no, you didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls? Nicole, you kiddin'?
I'll pee on Rihanna, see man, I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room, crazy-gluin' Madonna
To the La-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two, then sit on her
Imagine the visual for that, man, who would've thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick, unleashing his vengeance
But the chick's so old, she looks like she outlived a life sentence

In tangible goods, platinum Rolex'd it
We don't lease, we buy the whole car, as you should
My confederation, dead a nation
Explode on detonation, overload the mind of a said patient
When it boils to steam, it comes to it
We all fiends, gotta do it: even righteous minds go through this
True this, the streets school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and watch for intruders

Working like a... hmm... reverse archaeologist
Except his buried treasure was sunshine
So when some shined through a hole that he had drove
It reflected off the gold and almost made son blind
He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
Pulled hisself up out of his own grave and looked at the time
On the watch that had stopped six months after the shots
That'd got him in the box; wringing Henny out his socks
Figured it was hours because he wasn't older
Used some flowers to brush the dirt up off his shoulder
So, with a right hand that was all bones
And no reason to stay, he decided to walk home
So he..."

Havoc	7	What’s Ya Poison	Murda Muzik	1999	[Verse 2]	"How you want it, bent, ski'd or straight blunted?
Medium rare, raw? Havoc just over done it
And while you sittin' there whisperin', like a little girl
Fuck, waitin' around 'til the dutchie gets twirled
We going at you, not 'cause we want to, 'cause we have to
Revoke situation that you couldn't last through
If I can't have it all, then I don't want it at all
Off top serious dog, I'm out for the brawl
Battle the world, shit I kick'll dazzle your girl
Handle the bitch
Can't? Then take this referral
Hit 'em with the pink slip, get 'em bent to earl
Hennessy got my mind locked, tight in a curl
Hold it down like Saddam, you can't search my crib
Even with dirty worms I'ma still appear"

How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends"

Jay-Z	12	Monster	My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy	2010	[Verse 3]	"Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question, what do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfuckin' monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill a block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up"
The Game	13	Dreams	The Documentary	2005	[Verse 3]	"The dream of Huey Newton, that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin' you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin' on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
'Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece, like a Catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend has just begun"
JAY-Z	6	Legacy	4:44	2017	[Chorus]	"Legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

Got the vision and I made that clear (Clear)

I'm the one, that's why they tryna hurt the kid (Kid)
I'm the one, JH, with the braids, with the lights
With the ike and the smoke, but I can't stay away
See this life? Man, I can't stay away
Find a vice, man, I can't stay away
Find it hard, why I can't play it safe?
Seen the top ten pen list, I don't even know how they could pin this
Knowin' that I'm the human Pinterest
Need true love but I know true love's like a friendship
But even Titanic had an endin'
I rock the boat with ice so expensive
Hair long, not no extensions
Money long, shit is extended
She need me now, she need me a pendant
I said you need me now, I ain't finished, huh"
Eminem	15	Without Me	The Eminem Show	2002	[Chorus]	"Now, this looks like a job for me

Eminem	15	Sing for the Moment	The Eminem Show	2002	[Verse 1]	"These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problemed child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad, so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, durags, and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go"

Or never understood love 'til you lost one?
Where your heart at?

Where your heart at? Brave-hearted

Niggas layin' on they death bed tryna match me
Oh my God, I'm 'bout to do the fool

Switch both lanes, the engine sound like the zoo
Need a fee just to breathe, bitch, I can't talk to you
It's the Ben Frank murderer

Who is he? Free lunch, hmm, Kraft Services
Throw your ass out this rental if I smell nervousness
Hey now, say now, let me pop my shit

A monster about to come alive again
Soon as I pull up and park the Benz
We get this bitch shaking like Parkinson's
Take my number and lock it in
Indian hair, no moccasins
It's too many hoes in this house of sin
Real nigga back in the house again
Black Timbs all on your couch again
Black dick all in your spouse again
And I know she like chocolate men
She got more niggas off than Cochran, hah!"
André 3000	27	Spread	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Chorus 1]	"I don't want to move too fast, but

Snoop Dogg	0	Can U Control Yo Hoe	R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece	2004	[Verse]	"I went to your house
Your girl came in and started cussin' you out
You shoulda slapped her in the face
I wanted to tell you, but it wasn't my place
I kept on the low
Cause I knew that you was gonna check that ho
But instead you was quiet as a mouse
Made me start to think that it wasn't your house
Cause she was acting like a nut
You got the kind of bitch that will kick your butt
What kind of pimp holds back
Never met a bitch that a pimp can't slap
What's wrong with the pimpin'
Why you gettin' a whippin'
All I see is simpetttes"
Travis Scott	33	Pray 4 Love	Rodeo	2015	[Verse 1]	"Pray for who lost they fate and died too young, pray for the ones I hate, the ones I love
Pray for my liver when I'm off in this club, I pray that the demons go away, they hauntin' us
Man, I can't take no more of this lifestyle we been livin'
Man, I can't take no more of the white powers in position
Gotta grab up J-Will, gotta scoop up J-Rich, told CHASE we ain't goin' back, you know we gotta hitch
I mean, I'm aggravated, agitated, I admit, intoxicated, animated, got me feelin' kinda lit
Contemplatin', fornicatin', might as well fuck up some shit
They lookin' at me way too crazy, got me feelin' communist
But I'm just tryna save the throne, pray for BONES, pray for Stix
If my album never sell, then we gon' hit that lick
Tell Lamar, call up Cash, tell him, ""Buzz me at the Ritz""
It's the weekend, we off the deep end, you need to pray for us"
Nas	9	Got Ur Self a Gun	Stillmatic	2001	[Verse 1]	"My first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome, I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better? The world is still mine
Tattoo's real, with ""God's Son"" across the belly, the boss of rap
You saw me in Belly with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames could huddle, your team's shook
Y'all feel the wrath of a killer, 'cause this is my football field
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel
But the QB don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast 'cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody"
MC Ren	17	Approach to Danger	Efil4zaggin	1991	[Verse 1]	"You can approach, but the danger light is blinkin
A self-desctruct button is activated when I'm thinkin
This is a tribulation, the weak is judged
The prophecy was fulfilled, cause I never budge
I took up the tools, crucifixion was the extreme
They're seein doubles of me, but it wasn't a dream
One vision was of life, the other was death
And life didn't give a fuck if death took your last breath
So you burn in my pit that I call hell
Where you got sent, because your shit don't sell
My twenty-twenty was blurry from the smoke
Of the niggas that I burned and tormented but I didn't choke
I started doing them, I kept on doing them, two of them
Shoot them up until that nigga Ren was through with them
And my presence to the suckers was of a stranger
But fuck it, they can approach to the danger"

Nas	9	We Major	Late Registration	2005	[Verse 2]	"I heard the beat and I ain't know what to write
First line—should it be about the hoes or the ice?
Four-fours or Black Christ? Both flows'd be nice
Rap about big paper or the black man plight
At the studio console, asked my man to the right
""What this verse sound like? Should I freestyle or write?
He said, ""Nas, what the fans want is Illmatic, still""
Looked at the pad and pencil, and jotted what I feel
Been like twelve years since a nigga first signed
Now, I'm a free agent, and I'm thinking it's time
To build my very own Motown
'Cause rappers be deprived of executive nine-to-fives
And it hurts to see these companies be stealing the life
And I love to give my blood, sweat and tears to the mic
So y'all copped the LPs and y'all fiends got dealt
I'm Jesse Jackson on the balcony when King got killed
I survived the livest niggas around
Lasted longer than more than half of you clowns
Look, I used to cook before I had the game took
Either way, my change came like Sam Cooke"
Kendrick Lamar	16	GOD.	DAMN.	2017	[Bridge]	"I don't rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit
Cannonballs to ignite shit, morning to the night shift
I'm on, I ain't sorry for it
Asked for a piece of mind, you charged me for it
I wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
I'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
I got a bad habit, levitatin', duckin' haters
Oh my! My heart is rich, my heart is famous"

It probably wouldn't stop, talk shit and get socked
How ya hang em? Know a realer nigga? You could bring him
If I don't represent the shit, I'll kick it, we could sway him
Hunh! As if I know ya, then I could show ya
But if I don't know, I gotta .44 fo' ya
So, so peep game, at point blank range
The fame can't change what the game maintains
Strange! Went against the grain, aw shit!
Flick or no flick I trips for no bitch
Catch up on your pimpin', I ain't simpin', I'm a diss her
Couldn't be my sister if she's actin' like I missed her
Tell me why they, tell me why they, tell me why they play me
Don't these niggas know that neither one of y'all can fade me
I ain't big, I ain't buff, I ain't deisel
But fuck with 2Pac and pop goes the weasel
Me and Threat made a bet on how many fellas
Would jock a mothafuckin' real nigga 'cause they jealous
They do it for the fame, explain, insane

Sorry to hear that, my guess is you got work at the hotel
I'll take care of that, you'll soon see
Now please give me the room key

So please, would you put your hand back in sight?
They don't like to see me nervous, you can understand that, right?
You draw, better be Picasso—you know, the best
'Cause if this is not so, ah, God bless
You leave me no choice, I'll leave you no voice
Believe you me, son
I hate to do it just as bad as you hate to see it done
Now calm your boys

Trying not to scuff my Nike Air checks again
It's funny how niggas be the best of friends
And fall out over pussy and wanna dead they man
One of my niggas in the grave the other one in the pen
She fucking my enemies inside my homeboy's Benz

He got a cousin named Jason that rock the Gary Payton
Now the same trifling bitch is a HIV patient, true story"

Pack a gat and a vest under my clothes when I dress
Here's hopin' I die the way I lived, straight thuggin'
Huggin' my trigger for all them niggas that was buggin'
My homie told me once, ""Don't you trust them other suckers
They front like they your homies, but they phony motherfuckers""
And even if I did die young, who'd care?
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
Got homies in my head that done passed away screamin' ""Please!""

All I can do is get my grind on

Trickin' paper on a unh... Captain Save-a-ohhh
I've never been.. the type of nigga..
To take.. a broad to the courts
As a shorty I was always into sports
Now I talk to drums and walk in slums and thoughts that's ohhh
Instinct to hustle-divided by the struggle
Plus a couple of scuffle's and up to high shuffle
Even when it sound muffled..
I bust through.. narrow gates..
With king-sized thoughts that's sparrow shaped
Before I came up I had to elevate
Let a nigga move where he wanna move up to
You don't like how I'm livin... well fuck ohhh
I stuck to what I was on... a star is born on a cusp
Many angel's fell to the dust
Leavin' me to trust... only a ohhh
Leavin' me to trust y'all only a ohhh
Leavin' me to trust in a - ahh ohhh ohhh ohhh
Ohhh
Yo"
Common	22	Love Is…	Be	2005	[Verse 3]	"Some say that I'm a dreamer 'cause I talk about it often
Seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin
We walk and stand in, fall in it
With the right companion we all in it
Mary sang a song about it, having broad limits
In the game of life, it's the scrimmage
Reminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days
A letter to the people, love always, yeah"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Institutionalized	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 2]	"""Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
The constant big money talk 'bout the mansion and foreign whips
The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
One more sucker wavin' with a flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
Remember steal from the rich and givin' it back to the poor?
Well, that's me at these awards""
I guess my grandmama was warnin' a boy

Lupe Fiasco	23	MS. MURAL	DRILL MUSIC IN ZION	2022	[Verse 2]	"""I appreciate the visit, this isn't normally allowed""
""Do you consider yourself wild or conforming to a style?""
The patron pointed at a pile, ""Are those rejections or mistakes?""
The painter said, ""That is not for question or debate
Most of what we know as art is the projection of a faith
The product of a Pontiff or the election of a saint
A gift from the read for the digestion of the can't
A visual garnish for the confessions of the frank
Displays of physical carnage make connections to the ranks
Goes over very well with South Americans and Yanks
Not to sound shamanistic, but there's medicine in paint
It gets kinetic if you let it, there's a fetish in its strength
Martyrdom will call, Russian roulette is in the flanks
And most would pull the trigger if the weapon's full of blanks
But when there's a pool of sharks and you step into the tank
That's the pool of art that got 'em headed to the plank
But they fell for the deceptiveness of the secularist's complaint
The upheaval of the cathedral into the edifice of bank
That pile over there is just the evidence of angst
The failed revival of a perfectionist when his efforts have just sank
A selection of the waste that lacks direction or a base
You lose all of the plots for the affections of a race
Man does not become superior 'cause you connect him to a cape
Nor does become inferior because you connect him to a ape
I never wanted my life to be a collection of some dates
And holiday my days away and intellectually sedate
It's not really a beef but conceptually it's steak
Like do genitals and gender roles successfully conflate?
The current art world is just competitively opaque
It never ceases to amaze, my mouth is medically agape
One day its raising up the brand, the next it's shredding it to flakes
And the velocity of trends is what referees the pace
Professionally accept what ethically I hate
So in all of my work, you see this wrestling with fate
Deceiving in the brushstrokes how aggressively I strafe
Less like putting on some makeup, more like severing a face""
""Wow,"" said the patron with a smile
""That's the most interesting diatribe I've heard in a while
How you articulated the nature and put it all on trial
Took it up to Heaven, then put it on the ground""
The painter asked the patron, ""Can you stand up on the pile?
I've had a flash of inspiration, my creativeness aroused""
The model took its place, the painter grabbed a lighter
Doused the shit in gasoline and set it all on fire"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	Don’t Sweat the Technique	Don’t Sweat the Technique	1992	[Verse 1]	"Let's trace the hits and check the file
Let's see who bit to detect the style
I flip the script so they can't get foul
At least not now, it'll take a while
I change the pace to complete the beat
I drop the bass 'til MCs get weak
For every word they trace, it's a scar they keep
'Cause when I speak, they freak to sweat the technique
I made my debut in '86
With a melody and a President's mix
And now I stay on target and refuse to miss
And I still make hits with beats
Parties, clubs, in the cars and jeeps
My underground sound vibrates the streets
MCs wanna beef, then I play for keeps
When they sweat the technique"
Kanye West	5	Blood On the Leaves	Yeezus	2013	[Chorus 1]	"We could've been somebody
'Stead, you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you were screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happenin'"
The Game	13	Compton	Doctor’s Advocate	2006	[Verse 3]	"Welcome to the city of G's
Where we eat fried chicken, rice, and black-eyed peas

Cause we Ruthless, like Will before the Black Eyed Peas
Fuck all rappers, look at all the hate I see
I'm sick, you can't get rid of me, I'm HIV
Nigga get another job, hip-hop is not hiring
I'm the reason Dre feel comfortable retiring
I just might put out ""Detox"" myself
Smoke so much, I check in detox myself
One man army, took out Reeboks myself
45 in my khakis gotta watch my health
I'm so hard nigga, Glock 17 quick draw nigga
Like the old me, 17, sippin malt liquor
All black khaki suit, all black Converse
Nigga Imma keep on stomping coming Straight Outta"

But I'm close to the edge and she pushin' me Lord
The body language don' got a nigga stiff as a sword
So she can't be an angel, this bitch is a fraud
Head probably sent a nigga on a trip to the morgue
Pussy good enough to drive out to Michigan for it
As soon as I hit the door she's squeezin' my arm
Hoppin' all on a nigga like Christina Milion
It might take a couple rounds to make me get her calm
But when she does go to sleep she gon' need a alarm 'cause I'm gone
She wanna be with a Don but I'm stuck in so I'ma keep it 'bout me on this song ain't nuttin' wrong
With a little bumpin' and grindin'
Especially if if they got somethin' behind 'em
I'm high as hell, pissy drunk when I climb in, high in every function that I'm in"

My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldn't sleep cause on the real he had five kids
Live nig's, real niggas express and taste it
At crap games, black dames and big faces
Cases in court, fam' showing love and support
You and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport
As men we were taught to hold it in
That's why we don't know how 'til we older men (Yeah)
If love is a place I'ma go again
At least now, now I know to go within
At times it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then you're home again
I've seen love make a nigga soul pretend
Like a story that he don't want to end, yo"

Lately I been thinking 'bout this side

I gotta get back on this side
Really miss the feeling of the late nights
Shit we used to do around midnight
Hangin' on the corner, had shit tight

He was too involved with the street life
Only way to live on this side"

You know who I am you know my motherfuckin' name

Ice chain, Carti lens, and a knapsack
Always said if I rapped, I'd say somethin' significant
But now, I'm rapping 'bout money, hoes, and rims again

Big-face hundreds and whatever other synonyms
Strippers named ""Cinnamon,"" more chips than Pentium

I'm getting rid of muthafuckas as if they was a foreigner
Show no grief to pretend when I sin
I punch you can block it but I'ma still get in
This ain't a TKO in the first
But it's some shit from a nigga in black and much worse
Than a beating from Tyson 'cause Ren is not nice and
Your ass is better off just rolling a dice and
Finding you a number for luck
'Cause you will need it when you see I don't give a fuck
My identity, and the shit is getting shown
Without a video I'm still getting known 
I'm at a show then my picture is taken
One click of the flash and punk niggas are breakin'
To the door, tryin' to join my fan club
Lip-syncin' over one of my dubs
An instrumental will scratch for the moment
Until I fuck up the so called opponent
That's standing in the zone of the twilight
Saying, ""How in the fuck did he get mixed up in my fight?""
It wasn't a mistake, it was a set-up
So until I'm finished pumpin' my lyrics, you should shut up
And don't attempt to speak
Because it's bad enough you're rollin' up shit creek
With a nigga like Ren about the hit
Now let me hear you muthafuckas talk some more shit
Or I'ma bust your ass in the mouth
Yo, unless you're saying, ""Compton's in the house"""

Loving you is loving me"
Dr. Dre	1	Express Yourself (Extended Mix)	Straight Outta Compton	1988	[Verse 1]	"I'm expressin' with my full capabilities
Now I'm livin' in correctional facilities
'Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight, meditate, like a Buddhist
I'm droppin' flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he said it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat, and it'll make ya think
Some suckers just tickle me pink, to my stomach
'Cause they don't flow like this one
You know what, I won't hesitate to dis one or two before I'm through
So don't try to sing this
Some drop science, well I'm droppin' English
Even if Yella, makes it a-capella
I still express, yo I don't smoke weed or sess
'Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage nothin'
But makin' a sucker and you equal
Don't be another sequel"
Kendrick Lamar	16	tv off	GNX	2024	[Chorus]	"Mustard
Niggas actin' bad, but somebody gotta do it
Got my foot up on the gas, but somebody gotta do it
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off
Huh, turn his TV off, turn his TV off"
Prodigy	8	[Just Step Prelude]	The Infamous	1995	[Verse 2]	"Son, I got plans, power movements, get on some rude shit
I keep livin' like this, I might lose it
My man's comin' home from doin' long-ass bids
What up, Kiko? I ain't seen your ass since we was kids
It's all strange; my niggas locked down thinkin' long range
And see their names in the Daily News, third page
They sent a kite to my nigga Killa
It only took one sword to put seven holes in his squealer
A 3-to-9 spendin' most of his time inside the bing
Reclined, and still came home with his shine"
Nas	9	Last Words	Nastradamus	1999	[Chorus]	"These are last words of a hanging slave
How could I forget this
I rob you, put you on my hit list
Under my nails are dirty look at the grime
My burnt lips from the roach clips
How can I shine
Being broke and bag a dope bitch
Powerful minds, we brave men
I blow smoke and I'ma keep sayin'"
Nate Dogg	3	Bitch Please 2	The Marshall Mathers LP	2000	[Chorus]	"And you don't really wanna fuck with me
Only nigga that I trust is me
Fuck around and make me bust this heat"
Rakim	10	It’s Been a Long Time (Suave House Mix)	The 18th Letter	1997	[Verse 3]	"When I flow at night, I show them new heights, I go to write
They know I strike with new prototypes to blow the mic
Critics and biters, don't know where my source of light is
Still leave authors and writers with arthritis
Cursed kids like the Pyramids when they found the style
First to ever let a rhyme flow down the Nile
The rebirth of hip-hop'll be dropped now
Cause the crowd didn't hear the original in a while
So be alarmed, what you bout to see is the bomb
Like, 3-D in 'Nam, vivid like CD-Rom
Info kept like ""internet.com""
My note-book's my bond like the Holy Qu'ran
Since I came in the door, said it before
But no I ain't down with Eric B. no more
At night the open mic be inviting me to rhyme
So, yo, I'm online: it's been a long time"
Guru	20	B.I. vs. Friendship	Moment of Truth	1998	[Verse 1]	"Son you're supposed to be my man, but you ain't wise enough to realize
This is B.I., see I wanna taste the whole cake
Some things in this industry, shit be so fake
Make no mistake, if you're my man you'd understand
About the plan, to stack hundreds of grands (That's right!)
And how to stand, on much more acres of land
And to expand from the days of goin hand to hand
So like I was CEO I do my thing son
And turn this underground rap thing to my kingdom
Release a fistful, of rhymes for the fiscal year
MC's are wishful fuckin with this here
They stuck with the tear, for fear they foresake a brother's love
It's clear -- I'd have to be the better man I'm thinkin
The 7th Letter Man ain't got no time for petty speakin (uhh)
So we go our seperate ways I see the fork in the road
I know I blessed you with a portion of gold
And some good fortune to hold, so KEEP THAT
While I keep it movin, just like truckloads
Of interstate cargo, taxin niggas like U.S. embargoes
You my man like I said so all the best
You shoulda known we do shit differently than all of the rest
Can't afford to let a link be, loose in the chain
It's time for us to get mad more, juice in the game
You're buggin son (that's right) that's word to Billy and Fame
So I'mma state again, that we play to win (Yeah!)
So I don't care what you say to her or say to him
The object son, is to excel and lead
And niggas be bluffin', fallin' for nothin but greed"
Sleepy Brown	29	Church	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Chorus]	"Sometimes life can keep you down
With your face all in the dirt
Now if you feel that left behind
Need to get up and go to church
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Church)"
Big Boi	26	Rosa Parks	Aquemini	1998	[Verse 1]	"Many a day has passed, the night has gone by
But still I find the time to put that bump off in your eye
Total chaos, for these playas, thought we was absent
We takin' another route to represent the Dungeon Family
Like Great Day, me and my nigga decide to take the back way
We stabbin' every city then we headed to that Bat cave
ATL, Georgia, what do we do for ya?
Bulldoggin' hoes like them Georgetown Hoyas
Boy, you sounding silly, think my Brougham ain't sittin' pretty
Doing doughnuts 'round you suckas like them circles around titties
Damn, we, the committee, gon' burn it down
But us gon' bust you in the mouth with the chorus now, say"
JAY-Z	6	Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)	Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life	1998	[Verse 2]	"I flow for those 'dro'ed out
All my niggas locked down in the 10 by four, controllin' the house
We live in hard knocks
We don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back
Daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision, mama
I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot
Sleepin' on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type Braille
I'm tight grill with the phony
Rappers, y'all might feel we homies
I'm like, ""Still, y'all don't know me.""
Shit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
I'm tryna murder everything movin' – feel me?"
Eminem	15	So Far...	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 3]	"I'm tryin' to be low-key, hopefully nobody notices me
In produce, hunched over, giant nosebleed
Ogre style as I mosey over to the frozen aisle
By the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
Embarrassed, I just did Comerica with Hova
The show's over, I'm hidin' in Kroger, buyin' groceries
He just had front-row seats
Told me to sign this poster, then insults me
""Wow! Up close didn't know you had crow's feet!""
I'm at a crossroads, lost, still shoppin' at Costco's
Sloppy Joe's, bulk waffles
Got caught pickin' my nose (Agh!)
Look over, see these two hot hoes
Finger still up one of my nostrils
Right next to 'em, stuck at the light, the fuckin' shit's
Takin' forever to change, it's stuck, these bitches are lovin' it
Rubbin' it in, chucklin', couldn't do nothin'
Play it off, ""What you bumpin'?""
""Trunk Muzik, Yelawolf's better,"" fuckin' bitch!
They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it
The pressure, they want me to follow up with
Another one, after Recovery was so highly coveted
But what good is a fuckin' recovery if I fumble it?
'Cause I'ma drop the ball if I don't get a grip
Hoppin' out shrubbery on you sons of bitches
Wrong subdivision to fuck with, bitch
Quit snappin' fuckin' pictures of my kids
I love my city, but you pushed me to the limit—what a pity!
The shit I complain about
It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's rainin' out
Kool-Aid stain on the couch, I'll never get it out
But bitch, I got an elevator in my house
Ants and a mouse—I'm livin' the dream!"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Count Me Out	Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers	2022	[Verse 1]	"One of these lives, I'ma make things right
With the wrongs I've done, that's when I unite
With the Father, Son, 'til then, I fight
Rain on me, put the blame on me
Got guilt, got hurt, got shame on me
Got six magazines that's aimed at me
Done every magazine, what's fame to me?
(And I'm tripping and falling)
It's a game to me, where the bedroom at?
Sleep, I ain't nevеr had affairs with that
What's fair when the hearts and thе words don't reach?
What's fair when the money don't take things back?
It's rare when somebody take your dreams back
(And I'm tripping and falling)
I care too much, wanna share too much, in my head too much
I shut down too, I ain't there too much
I'm a complex soul, they layered me up
Then broke me down, and morality's dust, I lack in trust
(And I'm tripping and falling)
This time around, I trust myself
Please everybody else but myself
All else fails, I was myself
Outdone fear, outdone myself
This year, you better one yourself
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Masks on the babies, mask on an opp
Wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shop
But a mask won't hide who you are inside
Look around, the reality's carved in lies
Wipe my ego, dodge my pride
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Look myself in the mirror
Amityville, ain't seen nothin' scarier
I fought like a pitbull terrier
Blood I shed could fill up aquariums
Tell all my angels, ""Carry 'em""
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Every emotion been deprived
Even my strong points couldn't survive
If I didn't learn to love myself, forgive myself a hundred times, dawg"
Daz Dillinger	2	For All My Niggaz & Bitches	Doggystyle	1993	[Outro]	"Now all the bitches and the niggas
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
To all my niggas and my bitches

To all my niggas and my bitches
Wave your motherfuckin' hands in the air
And if you don't give a fuck like we don't give a fuck
Keep your motherfuckin' fingers in the air"

Rakim	10	All Night Long	The Master	1999	[Chorus]	"So if you love to get your party on
And you feel that your game is strong
And you get mad when the broads is gone
You like it all-night-long
And when they love it when the place is warm
And they go out for their favorite song
They hate when the player game is wrong
They like it all-night-long"
Big Boi	26	Roses	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Outro]	"Crazy bitch

You know you fucked up when you let my mind creep
Deeper than the page of a book, let me look
You let me hit the stage, now I got my folks hooked
Like, deep, you wanna go deep, I'll take you deep
You know you fucked up when you let my mind creep
Deeper than the page of a book, let me look
You let me hit the stage, now I got my folks hooked

Extra, extra, extraterrestrial (Skrrt, yeah)"
Common	22	Geto Heaven Part Two	Like Water for Chocolate	2000	[Verse 2]	"Love, your happiness don't begin with a man
Strong woman, why should you depend on a man?
I understand you want a man that's resourceful
If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you
Talking to a friend, about what love is
Her man didn't love her, 'cause he didn't love his
Hugged her from afar, said what I felt
You'll never find a man, till you find yourself
Time helps mistakes, you can learn from
'Cause one man fucked up, men you shouldn't turn from
You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too
At that destination, a king will anoint you
Going through the storm, anybody seems warm
That relationship died, for you to be born, you worth more
Than anything you could cop at a store
For you to grow, he had to go, so what you stopping him for?
Not even I could ignore being alone is hard
Find heaven in yourself and God"

Havoc	7	Get Dealt With	Hell On Earth	1996	[Verse 2]	"Yo, if it ain't drama, money or bum, broke bitches
Simple-minded niggas out for Havoc position
That's opposition, wettin' me calm edition
Suddenly and outta the blue and now I see
Find myself by myself and rollin' mad trees
Paranoid on point and now I see who's who
Distinguish fake ones outta the immediate crew
Life, I take one if you jeopardize mine, duke
You're small, minute, got a deck to deal with aces up
You overbidded and in the Bridge, you got stuck
This ain't a card game, but in perspective, it's the same
Put two and two together, Mobb Deep with one name
Contain drama like Outbreak
You order drama, we outtake, then take you out
Keep it real and throw the fake out
Raise the stakes up, hit you up from the waist up
That's how it is and how it is is kinda fucked up
But our beats bangin', got your whole clique singin'
On a corner while it's rainin', four pound left ya ears ringin'
Delete those and keep my shit discrete
Niggas is trash rhymin', totally offbeat
And outta sync with they life, E&J been tight
Nigga, slow your roll
You're speedin', now you bleedin' tonight for no reason
Wanna be macks and thugs, get smacked, show no love
Crush your team like a bear hug
The Infamous'll do dirt that'll smear like mud
New York, New Yitty, Queens, I feel no pity, no remorse
Takin' it to the source of course
Where that ass, thug real, kid, it's only your mask
That you wear, take off, cop out, feel the blast
Who on top of boom, gat-for-gat
And all the wolves got the drop on you
And let the nickel-nine pop on you"
Nas	9	Life We Chose	Nastradamus	1999	[Chorus]	"It's the life we chose, where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
And the only way out, is death or going broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it
And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..
This life is the only life I know..."

Stand alone, provide my own supper
Tell ya baby momma stop comin' around here or I'm gon' fuck her
Don't try to take up for them lames around you
He'll get shots for free like I flagrant fouled you
I'm on the road blowin' grade A haze and brown (Uh huh)
Got niggas runnin' like the KKK's around (Yea!)
My album's comin', a new year's approachin'
My buzz gettin' bigger, a few ears is open
Can your team play in the game, without you there to coach 'em?
There's a very fine line between a pool and a ocean
Sometimes I'm in Atlanta where they Bankhead bounce
And you could come, but after you give Banks head, bounce (Bounce)
These niggas really want war, 'cause if so put on your vest
'Cause all you gotta do is say yes"
Travis Scott	33	first take	Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight	2016	[Chorus]	"Don't like what I saw

You that faggot-ass nigga tryna pull me back, right?
When my joint get to bumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at your bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me, ""Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate, then let 'em hate, and watch the money pile up""
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be"

Up in the air with the pedal on the flizzor
Bandana tied around the rear view mirror

Cryin', lookin' at my niece's and my nephew picture
They say don't let this cruel world get ya
Kinda suspicious, swearin' one day you might leave me
For somebody that's richer
Twist the cap off the bottle, I take a sip and see tomorrow
Gotta make it if I have to beg or borrow
Readin' love letters; late night, locked down and quiet
If brothers don't receive they mail, best believe we riot
Eatin' Jack-Mack, starin' at the walls of silence
Inside this cage where they capture all my rage and violence
In time I learned a few lessons, never fall for riches
Apologies to my true sisters, far from bitches
Help me raise my Black nation, reparations are due
It's true, caught up in this world I took advantage of you
So tell the babies how I love them, precious boys and girls
Born black in this white man's world—and all I heard was"
Gang Starr	21	Mostly Tha Voice	Hard to Earn	1994	[Chorus]	"Still, it's mostly the voice that gets you up

Hattie McDaniel got a Oscar
For playing Mammy in ""Gone with the Wind""

I said I dip, dive, what can I say?
Niggas need to stop fuckin' with O.J
Some niggas bang Blood, some niggas bang Crip
And bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
I had a dream of hoes, I had to screen my hoes
I seen my hoes in all kinds of clothes
Lil' Almond Joy, I truly enjoy
If you blew my balls right through my drawers
Come back to the mansion, chill at the spot
From the way she was blowin', I know she does it a lot
I have a eight-and-a-half, nine-and-three-quarters
The ho started callin' when I started boss ballin'
Gimme some head, gimme some ass (Uh-huh)
Gimme some cash, pass it to Daz
Pass it to Snoop, or pass it to Nate
See hoes eat dick like eggs and steak

Headed for them packed jails, or maybe it's a hearse
My only way to stack mail is out here doin' dirt
But my decision's do or die, been hustlin' since junior high
No time for askin' why, gettin' high, gettin' mine
Put away my .9 'cause these times call for four-five shells
'Cause life is hell and everybody dies
What about these niggas I despise
Them loud talkin', cowards shootin' guns into crowds, jeopardizin' lives
Shoot 'em right between them niggas' eyes, it's time to realize
Follow the rules or follow them fools that die

Niggas confused, quit tryna  be an O.G. and pay your dues
If you choose to apply yourself, go with the grain
Then come the riches and the bitches and the fame, heavy in the game"

You's a bad girl, gotta spank ya
And gotta thank ya for that head clinic
Explicit, hella photogenic
And tell your friends where the dick's at
Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soulmate
Before you kiss 'em, use Colgate
She swallowed it, yeah, the bitch took the whole eight
And ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it
And Hittman hit it; damn, bitches

Common	22	It’s Your World (Part 1 & 2)	Be	2005	[Verse 1]	"Night blows, stoves don't work, hoes at work
A warrior, so I wear 'em on my shirt
Wish I was free as Che was, I spend a day buzzed
Trippin' on heights, wishin' for Nikes in different flavors
The age of Kane and Big Daddy, short-body Caddies
Uncles named Larry, that really never grabbed me
My mother gave birth but she really never had me
Left to the hood to play daddy
Raised by niggas named Butch, Scoot or Bae-Bae
With weight so they weigh they status on the streets
License plates that say they, motto
This is Chicago in the heyday
Similar to Good Times, I guess that I was JJ
A skinny nigga, young girls with Penny figures
So many niggas, stacked upon each other
It's the black upon each other that we love so much
Wonder how many of us these drugs gonna touch
Used to gangbang, ain't really thug that much
Rather have some thick broads and a dutch to clutch
Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years
My college career got downed with a couple of beers
Came back home, now I gotta pay back loans
Same nigga, same block, same shit they on
Only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome
In my defense, yo, I had to hit that zone
Man to man, I'm good workin' with my hands
My generation never understood workin' for the man
And, of being broke I ain't a fan
Now I stand in the same spot as my old man
My life I planned not to be on this corner
I still wanna see California
But this is my world"
Snoop Dogg	0	Ups & Downs	R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece	2004	[Chorus]	"There will be ups and downs, smiles and frowns

Nas	9	2nd Childhood	Stillmatic	2001	[Verse 1]	"Yo, explode, my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers
Was years back, before Nasir would explore a career in rap
As a music dude, I mastered this Rubik's Cube
Godzilla, fought Gargantua, eyes glued to the tube
Was a long time ago, John Boy Ice
Geronimo po-lice jumpin' out Chryslers, e-z wider paper
Pops puffin' his cess, punchin' his chest like a gorilla
Outside was psychos, killers
Saw Divine, Goon, and Chongo, Lil' Turkey
R.I.P. Tyrone, 'member no cursin' front of Ms. Vercey
Big Percy, Crazy Paul, the Sledge Sisters
My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean
I knew all that I'd seen had meant somethin'
Learned early to fear none, little Nas was huntin'
Livin' carefree laughin', got jokes on the daily
Y'all actin' like some old folks, y'all don't hear me
Yo, I'm in my second childhood"
Big Boi	26	Xplosion	Stankonia	2000	[Verse 3]	"With a one-two punch, B-Real and André drop they verses
Your homeboy Daddy Fat Sax playin' clean-up, so it worsens
People and persons on the opposite teams, oh, yes, its curtains
No bullets burpin', oh, just lyrically twerking, oh
Making a statement when you freestyle and your mind is in a free state
It's kinda hard to execute when you ain't feeling it that day
Jumpin' the gun and rushing your flow
Babbling on the mikie like auctioneer
Got the public's ears fucked up, can't hear
Atlanta, Georgia where y'all at? (right here)
OutKast this Dirty South to death the Dungeon Family Camp
Got this thang licked like stamps and nine-volt battery end caps
Making that music that make your neck hurt
And the beats that bother your back in my Cadillac
Six woofers and four amps
Lo pro vogues on swole, with the carriage lamps
Diamond tucked velour pistol in my lap
Come in peace, but then explode like boobie traps"

I can go from car to car, these bitches quarter million at least
Two thousand for the shoes, I keep some shit on my feet

No policing me, I got the beast in me, I gotta holla
Keep the decency and make them TNT my product
I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator, energizer
Inner city bullet flyin' 'til that bitch on auto pilot

All I care about is wearing out your area
And airing out your upper body
When I catch ya walking out your parents' house
(Don't get it fucked up!) Homie got fucked up
Tryna park his tour bus, not knowing what's what
Or who's who, living in the L.A. County zoo
Pick them off like a big dog, motherfucker, woof!
Once upon a time, I shot a nigga on accident (Boom, boom, boom)
I tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicing (Boom, boom, boom)
That's when I realized banging wasn't for everybody
Switch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me
They liable to bury him, they nominated six to carry him
They worry him to death, but he no vegetarian
The beef is on his breath, inheriting the drama better than
A great white, nigga, this is life in my aquarium"

Fresh, uh-huh—yes, she is
Had a feeling that it would be a day like this
The orchestra in my mind, don't play like this, naw
But I'm prepared for it, got a little rare for it
Brushed off my Airs, even cut my hair for it
'Cause normally I don't care for it
Don't even be looking for light like that, then there go it
Yeah, right over there, so I prepared to pour it
Little scared, my stare lowered, momma said have no fear
Plus I'm already out of my chair
Gather up my Airs on my square from here forward
It's nothing, right
So here go it, whispered in her ear
It's kinda crowded in here, would she care to blow it

I'mma drink away the pain until the brain get numb
Can't take all my dogs gettin' lost in the fog
Never, to return I guess they heard God's call
And naythin' don't surprise me now
Prepare for the worst, and never believe the silver line clouds
Scrutinize crowds
My surroundings
Get suspect we start four-poundin' shit
Picture me up in the mix
With the next man broke and is on my dick
A good man of plenty but an enemy it was clear
I just be another problem that he feenin' to fix
But I, can't have that
Pull out, I try to grab that
Caught one niggas like Mahadat"

Hangin’ out the window, they don’t care no more

Big L	25	Casualties of a Dice Game	The Big Picture	2000	[Verse]	"Me and my man was cruising through the streets and everything was flowing nice
The corner's crowded, niggas must be rolling dice
I parked the ride so my nigga Iroc can crash the lye spot
And I'ma gamble until he come back - why not?
Click-clack, cock the gat back, gotta be strapped
The game was mad packed, mad cats pockets was fat
They playing cee-lo, my dick get hard when I see dough
I bets nothing less than a G yo, you know my steelo
First I was losing then I started throwing headcrack
After headcrack, got my bread back, jumped in my red Ac'
I'm waitin for my nigga to come out of the spot
I see niggas starting to plot and I'm far from my block
Finally he walked out, told him, ""Hop the fuck in""
On my face he saw the grin and said, ""How much did you win?""
I estimated about, 45 maybe 50 G's
My man was hungry so I dropped him off at Mickey D's
Now I'm alone, heading home to rest my dome
Spotted some niggas trailing so I picked up the phone
Called Bones, I said, ""Yo son, I'm on the run, need your help before I get done
Meet me downstairs, bring your big gun""
I don't believe this, this nigga said he can't make it
Cause some bitch is in his house butt-naked
And then he hung up and this supposed to be my man and he don't give a fuck
That duck sold me out just to get a nut, what?
I'm cruising fast and they still behind me
The same nigga who I won the money from and his grimy crimey
It's about to get real hasty, grabbed the steel, took it off safety
'Cause I refuse to let these niggas waste me
I started to cruise fast, then stopped short and made 'em crash
And now them fags is all bloody from the shattered glass
And one of them had passed, when his face smashed the dash
I was injured too, leaking with a deep gash
I ain't panicked, I was quite calm
Couldn't use the right arm, so I grabbed the gat with the left
Walked up to the car the creep was stuck in the seat
Looked at him, shook my head then started bucking my heat
It's over now 'cause both of these motherfuckers asleep
I think I'm dying, I'm feeling weak out on my feet
But before I got some medical help, I had to catch a cab first
To one-forty-first and Bradhurst
That's where Bones live, walked in the building, staggering
Lookin tore down, shot his door down and beat his whore down
From the look in my eye, he knew he would die
Started to cry, stuck the gat to his head and said, ""Why?""
Then he offered me all of his cheese
Then dropped to his knees and begged me please not to squeeze
Then his brains got blast out, he's ass-out, then I dashed out
Into the streets covered with blood, about to pass out
The hospital's up, a couple of blocks, I'm on my way but
Damn, here comes a couple of cops; I pulled out
And started blowing they started blowing back I'm going all out
I ain't holding back, I been to jail once and I ain't goin back
I kept shooting, one shot caught a cop dead in his top
The other pig ducked behind a big truck
I was bleeding real bad and couldn't stop it
But still had the fifty thou' profit in my pockets
The coast was clear, so I jetted to a park that was near
Seen kids playing everywhere then threw the cash in the air
I watched all of them, run for their share
And all I can do was stare, I got weak and fell on my rear
Now I can hear the sirens, that means here comes the Jakes
But it's too late, I'm knocking on the pearly gates"
The Game	13	Crenshaw/80s and Cocaine	The Documentary 2.5	2015	[Verse 1]	"Parked at the light, give a fuck about a bitch nigga
Only nigga worth six figures that still click triggers

Riding through South Central in the 'Wood like I should
But I'm a Compton nigga, west side monster nigga
You should know by now, I fuck with all kinds of niggas
Call Big-U and we gon' see 'bout that vagina in you
You don't bang huh? Yea, that's that out-of-towner in you
My niggas eat late night, Mel's Diner menu
You a shooter? Better have that North Carolina in you
I had wolves at all kinds of venues
Dub's show I let the snub show, shall I continue?
Fuckin' niggas up like it's '05

Like Dr. Frankenstein of arts and crafts
Now could we make a, a difference
Antwan Patton and André Benjamin
Been jammin' for you crabbing rap niggas and journalists
That's quick to misprint public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears and think it's dismissed
Part two, the sequel, all-new 'Kast, just ain't the same
Gang of nerds on the internet slandering your name
Behind that screen name, they're lame and their life is pretty plain
M&M's with no nuts, won't show up face-to-face Straight bitch-made, like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Address it on a case-by-case basis like the judge
What about these lyin' ass hoes tryin' to plot
Or these niggas on the block who want the queen

But even she can walk, we'll miss her, we ain't gon' fake it
But God don't make mistakes, must be something bigger waiting"

Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was nine, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At twenty-nine, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert

Pull in the ring, repeatin and sayin the same thing
Xerox, zero, no match, you ditto
Copy machine, couldn't reprint my litto
My new style, that I produce now's beyond two-thou'
I knew how, since a juvenile, to make a ka-pow
When the night's fallin, I can hear the mic callin
I like ballin, I cut back like Mike Jordan
This is for y'all while I'm spittin literatures
Lyrics'll ball like Allen Iverson dribble the ball
They hopeless - whoever approaches my high explosives
My vision sadicious, and freestyle's ferocious

Don't amount to half of this shit I done did to you
Violated and tiptoed into a crib or two
I've come clean to be a bigger individual
Even though you're busy boo, the evening's when I visit you
Kinda makes me feel lucky, 'cause I see niggas
When you tease 'em with your physical

About these young brothers, from the City of Wind
Like juice and gin, in the city we blend
Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims
Y'all know the Sprewells and trucks that's detailed
Heartless females that wanna ride in em
Felt the southside venom in raw hides and denim
Pimp minds collide wit em, a system that tries victims
We living in, my man in the fast lane pivoting
On the block white is selling like Eminem
On the block it ""Jump Off"" like Kim and them
On the block it's hot, you can feel it, in your skin and then
Shorties get the game but no instructions to assembling
Eyes bright, it seems like the fight is dimming them
Call my man cuzzo, like I'm kin to him
He trying to stay straight, the streets is bending him"

For being jealous of a brother when he rise
I can see it in your eyes, you wanna see a young playa fallin'
They hate to see a nigga ballin'
Some of you suckers is rotten, plottin' on what I got
And then you wonder why I shot him (Booyeah)
Stop givin' game for free, you wanna hang with me
Like being a thug is the thang to be
But I got love for my homies, the G's and macks
And if you're Black, you better stay strapped
Nigga, fuck the world!"

You think she gon' stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars, hurt?
You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalized without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood, is it worth the time?
Like, who got your best interest?
Like, how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you?
And who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
Revenge on your mind when it's mentioned
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes, but your peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say;"
Big Boi	26	Gasoline Dreams	Stankonia	2000	[Verse 2]	"It's shitty like Ricky Stratton got a million bucks
My cousin Ricky Walker got ten years doing Fed time

That's if you're racist or you're crooked
Arrest me for this dope, I didn't weight it up or cook it
You gotta charge the world 'cause over a million people took it
Look at me, I'm out of your jurisdiction, now you're lookin' stupid
Officer, get off me, sir
Don't make me call L.A.—he'll have you walking, sir
A couple of months ago, they gave OutKast the key to the city
But I still gotta pay my taxes, and they give us no pity
About these youngsters amongst us
You think they respect the law?
They think they monsters, they love us, reality rappin'
And giving the youth the truth from this booth
And when we on stage, we scream
Don't everybody, everybody..."

Nas	9	One Mic	Stillmatic	2001	[Verse 2]	"All I need is one blunt, one page and one pen
One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me, fuck all of them
Jesus died at age thirty-three, there's thirty-three shots
From twin Glocks, there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
Which means one of my guns was holdin' seventeen
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, two mini nines
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way, they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now"

I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make
County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else"

Eminem	15	As the World Turns	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Verse 1]	"I hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsidaz, baby, and we suin' the courts
'Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
Yo, they never should've booted me outta reform school (Uh-uh)
Deformed fool, takin' a shit in the warm pool
'Til they threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said, ""It wasn't me, I got a twin""
Oh my God, it's you, not again (Ahh)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
'Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll pass the test guessin'
And all the other kids said, ""Eminem is a thizz head
He'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is Phys Ed""
Maybe true, 'til I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she need a Slim Fast
(Who, me?) Yeah, bitch, you so big
You walked into Vic Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
(Well, I have never)
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
(Wait, wait, wait, wait)
I felt the evilness and started transformin' (Rrrahh)
It began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheerin' fans swarmin'
Grabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground (Come here, bitch)
And took her up to the highest divin' board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly-flop"

Big Pun	24	You Came Up	Capital Punishment	1998	[Verse 2]	"Ay-yo, ain't nothin' changed, I'm still the same
The way you remembered me, since the centipede
Harder, big blacker, back in the 70's
Try to remember me from my aggressive will
The way I kept it real is more important than any record deal
I used to chill on the block with Cuban and Seis
I still do, but now it's in the blue convertible eight-- fifty
My true niggas'll always be wit' me
The shifty kiss me, tell me they miss me, then try to diss me
'Cause I'm a rispy, crispy for life, sixtie's the price
Another fifty for the Cuban twisted in ice
Niggas is sheist, but I psych 'em out
Though they like to doubt
I make 'em all believers, once I let the Tyson out
'Cause I can vouch for only a few, only the crew
From the old school, I consider loyally true
I morally grew from a fool to a scholar
Follow the rules on how to spot a plotter
That's cool for a dollar
I wanna holla at my peeps that's reppin' the streets
Wrestlin' the beast of chest, restin' in peace
Blessin' my seeds and watchin' over us

Reflex sets the pitch, vocals rip through projects
Crazy shouts are heard all around

I got some brand new Timbs, so MCs sing new hymns
You better repent, come correct or represent
Or get stomped, smacked and slapped, cap peeled back
I got you open and now you cling to my sack
Get off, hands off, stay off, you're way off
You rookie motherfuckers, it's the finals, not the playoffs
I'll break you up into particles
To small pieces because your brain is miniscule
You little fool, come learn the tools of the trade
I made the rules, so go to school and get played
Just when you're thinkin' that your jam is hot
Up steps the niggas who be blowin' up the spot"

Little rapper turn it out because I'm very plugged
I convert, I can work anywhere in the world
You can ask my brother Hugg
He'll concur that I'm serious with the words
To the man up above, thank you very much
That I got what I got and I'm at where I'm at
Like an ""a"" in a circle, with a pay, lil Urkel
What they say when they see lil G
From the F to the F with the amazing verbals
While they race in a circle like they racing a gerbil
I race in a circle like I'm racing a horse
I'm racing a Porsche, while they racing in place
They race in a cage, I race on a course

I am still a raisin in the sun, raging against the machine"
Dr. Dre	1	Still D.R.E.	2001	1999	[Verse 1]	"It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga, my last album was 
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
()
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leaves, still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still"

Big Boi	26	Mainstream	ATLiens	1996	[Verse 4]	"Everybody's a player, wearing them Kangols on their head
Thinking it's all about your clothes, nigga, it's all about your self
The way you feel about your life, the times that you done shared with
Your friends and family, up and down like hoes give head
To dicks, oh, six, serving them in the mix, but ain't no mystery
You know the history about this clique, bitch
Oh, what, you want me to call you slut?
But why you fucking all them niggas letting them all up in your guts
But see that AIDS I'm afraid I think that's why I play the quiet role
I lay in the cut, every month thinking I'll let that fire roll
Like chimneys, and smoke signals, maybe peace pipes even
My partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven
In the mainstream, home team bangin' 'em with these hits
In the mix (Mix), flowing like some motherfucking swordfish"

My spirit's awakened, my brain is asleep
I got a new temperature
Sharpenin' multiple swords in the faith I believe
I think about Robert Kelly
If he weren't molested, I wonder if life'd fail him
I wonder if Oprah found closure
The way that she postered the hurt that a woman carries
My mother abused young
Like all of the mothers back where we from
SSI bury family members
At the repass, they servin' Popeyes chicken
What you know about Black trauma?
F&Ns, kickin' back is another genre
Tyler Perry, the face of a thousand rappers
Using violence to cover what really happen
I know somebody's listenin'
Past life regressions to know my conditions
It's based off experience
Karma for karma, my habits insensitive
Watchin' my cousin struggle with addiction
Then watchin' her firstborn make a million
And both of them off the grid for forgiveness
I'm sacrificin' myself to start the healin' and..."

I done came through the block in everything that's fly
I'm like Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga, I get my ""By any means"" on whenever there's a drought
Get your umbrellas out because that's when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game
I just rolled the dice, trying to get some change
And I'd do it twice, ain't no sense in me
Lying as if I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains
Hope you don't think users are the only abusers
Niggas getting high within the game
If you do then, how would you explain?
I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins
I got a hustler spirit, nigga, period
Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go, you are what you are player
And you can try to change but that's just the top layer
Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here
Only God can judge me, so I'm gone
Either love me, or leave me alone"

They've got no name, so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However, I do show some respect to few
This ecstasy's got me standin' next to you
Gettin' sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the morning like, ""Yo, what the fuck we'd do?""
I gotta go, bitch, you know I got stuff to do
‘Cause if I get caught cheatin', then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run, these drugs are probably
Gonna catch up sooner or later, but fuck it, I'm on one
So let's enjoy, let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'Til we walk around lookin' like some wind-up dolls
Shit's stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm gonna try to find some more"

Peep the fiend shootin diesel in his arm in the alley (Ahhhhh)
Look at the chrome spinner spinnin on that black Denali (Wooo)

You know not to do good now"
Rakim	10	Real Shit	The Master	1999	[Verse 2]	"Here we come now, turntable spin like a merry-go-round
Never slow down, depending on how good your stereo sounds
Set it, up in the hood where we go surround
Tearin' through towns, turn 'em into burial grounds
This is the track that made Theodore wanna scratch
The track that caused the first kid to spin on his back
And then we saw, kids spray-painting the wall
While some of y'all was waitin' for war breakin' the law
It's no antidote it's what you can't provoke
So just relax with your girls or your mans and smoke
And take a real hit, soon as it bang you feel quick
It's real thick, this is that ol' real shit
This is the description of designs for you to listen to
Reminiscin' the times and nothin' in particular
Keep you goin' just like a whole pot of coffee
Have you and your shorty doin' 80 in a 40"

Kanye West	5	Good Morning	Graduation	2007	[Verse 2]	"Good mornin', on this day we become legendary
Everythin' we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary

But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came

Pushin you to do no wrong, praying for you that you live long
Nobody kill my baby, but she know her baby crazy
In and out of jail, mom's screamin', ""God take me!""
This is your pop, chip off the old block that made him
The man of the house, mom and pops separatin'
Spittin' image of a gangsta, the way pop walked
The way pop talked, got older and you thanked him now
This is your hood, poor folks drugs and robberies
Turnin' into the things moms wanted you not to be
Crime followin' the wrong dudes who have no values
Life's cheap as the dime in the minds of those around you
This is the test, the stress, the conflict, the ups and downs of
Niggas around you make threats
They tell you keep it gangsta, no matter the predicament
Even though your decision won't help you benefit"

In AA, they make you say that
That's the prayer they burn in your head when you in CASAT (Woo)
Man, I might talk to you while we up in them pens (Uh-huh)
But when we come home, that don't mean we gon' fucking be friends
The shells pass your head close enough to hear 'em whistle
Thank God they missed you and go grab your pistol
In the hood, niggas running 'round acting crazy (Uh-huh)
Buying little Air Jordans for maybe babies
See, it might be his and it might be yours
'Cause them broads in the projects is straight up whores (Haha)
Man, it don't take much for you to get in them drawers (Uh-huh)
You can have 'em on they back or on all fours
You ain't got to tell me you feeling this shit

Kurupt	4	Dogg Pound Gangstaz	Dogg Food	1995	[Verse 1]	"Now, my rhymes are as potent as pipe bombs
It takes time to concoct rhymes like mines
Like land mines — all set to explode
Microphones — all set to unload
Zone watch, that means watch the zone
I'm in a temple with a million dead MC microphones
And they all wanted back by they peeps
Sleep if you dare, 'cause death catch niggas when they sleep
Beware of the consequences
It's senseless to face a prosecuted life-or-death MC sentence
Travel through your inner thoughts
Just to vision how far I can get, explore to the inner core
And ain't stopped yet, continue the journey
'Cause all that shit you kick just don't concern me
You can't U-turn me, back to reality where niggas pack straps
And they mentality reacts so violently
That leave MC's breathin' silently
With hollow point talons for the violence
Ain't no harmin' me, ain't got no love for no hoes in Harmony
It's easy to find MC's to execute
Chances of survival too small to compute
Recognize, like this was Samuel Sneed
I grip the microphone, continue with my devilish deeds
'Cause all I see in my M-I-N-D is D-P-G for L-I-F-E
And all I see, on the M-I-C is another mangled MC opposin' me
Supposed to be regulatin' in this rap era
Made one error up against the microphone terror
It takes two to tangle
I told Daz, don't worry, like Keith Murray, I'mma strangle
MC's with the microphone cord
You don't faze me, your thoughts been invaded and explored
I know the ins and the outs to ya, buddy
I know where you live, and how you make your money
I came to violate you, desecrate you
I create two murderous scenes, can you relate, too?"

Rakim	10	Rest Assured	Don’t Sweat the Technique	1992	[Verse 2]	"I'm fillin' up the page when I'm steppin' on stage
Got the people in a rage with they hands in the air
Fellas sayin' ""Ho"", everybody yellin' ""Go""
Fly ladies in the house all screamin' ""Oh yeah""
That's how they react when I attack the mic
In fact it's like a stack of dynamite, powerful and bright
Girls love to squeeze me real tight
007 is back
Ra has returned to romance 'em, better than Johnny Handsome
When I was young women said, ""Damn son""
Ain't nothin' changed but the year and I'm still here
C'mere dear, let me whisper in your ear
Hug my words so I can taste your lips
I set up hips like domino chips
But I don't let 'em hit the floor
And if you got sore, then feel secure
Where's the pain? Is it the spot you set us in?
Almost magic, better than medicine
Take one of these and put your mind at ease
I get more work than a lot of M.D.'s
If I'm hawkin' New York or out on tour
I express the raw dialect and explore
But don't get fooled by metaphor
""007 is back""
Rest assured"

OutKast	28	The Rooster	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse 1]	"Okay, I started out all alone
'Cause my baby mama left me
Now there's nobody at home
Beginning to feel like Ms. Jackson done got cloned
Well it's some real shit and I'm living it through this song
A moving vehicle took my family
As I slept out on the sofa in the Boom Boom Room
I woke up very upset
I throw the covers back and peek out of the draperies
My daughter, my baby, my baby mama all escaping me
Like a candle in the wind, she was my friend
Like Princess Di' before she died, therefore we tried and tried again
But in the end, you pay attention to the pluses
But the minuses behind make it seem like you can't win"
Gang Starr	21	Mostly Tha Voice	Hard to Earn	1994	[Chorus]	"The voice that gets you up

I'm diagnosed with real nigga conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close, get money, fuck bitches

My momma told me that I'ma work myself to death
My girl told me don't let these hoes get in my head
My world been ecstatic, I checked the signal that read—"
2Pac	18	White Man’z World	The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory	1996	[Verse 2]	"Bein' born with less, I must confess, only adds on to the stress
Two gunshots to my homie's head, died in his vest
Shot him to death and left him bleedin' for his family to see
I pass his casket, gently askin', is there a heaven for G's?
My homeboy's doin' life, his baby mama be stressin'
Sheddin' tears when her son finally ask that questions
Where my daddy at? Mama, why we live so poor?
Why you cryin'? Heard you late night through my bedroom door
Now, do you love me, mama? Why they keep on callin' me nigga?
Get my weight up with my hate and pay 'em back when I'm bigger
And still thuggin' in this jail cell, missin' my block
Hearin' brothers screamin' all night, wishin' they'd stop
Proud to be black, but why we act like we don't love ourselves?
Don't look around, busta, (You sucka!) check yourselves
Know what it means to be black, whether a man or girl
We still strugglin' in this white man's world"

Tell me before we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
Been allergic to talkin', been a virgin to bullshit
And sell a dream in the auction, tell me just who your boss is
Niggas be fugazi, bitches be fugazi
This is for fugazi
Niggas and bitches who make habitual lyin' babies
Bless them little hearts
You can never persuade me
You can never relate me to him, to her, or that to them
Or you, the truth you love to bend
In the back, in the bed, on the floor, that's your ho
On the couch, in the mouth, I'll be out, really though
See, loud, rich niggas got low money
And loud, broke niggas got no money
The irony behind it is so funny
And I seen it all this past year
Pass on some advice we feel:"
André 3000	27	Happy Valentine’s Day	Speakerboxxx / The Love Below	2003	[Verse 4]	"Got a sweet lil' darlin' back in my corner
Below, I know I love her, but act like I don't want her
Surrounded by the lovely, but yet, feel like a loner
Could be an organ donor the way I give up my heart
But never know because, shit, I never tell her
Ask me how I'm feeling, I'd holla that it's irrele–
I don't get myself caught up in the Jello jella
And pudding pops, that others opt to call falling in love
But for the record, have you ever rode a horse?
Like for you to send me to Pluto, I said, ""Of course!""
But if you ain't a sweety, indeedy, I won't endorse
Han Solo 'til I'm hit by the bullet, so may the force
Be with you and I'll hit you when better time permits
For now, show me samples, examples why you're the shit
But how am I to know with the profession that I'm in?
And if you do not know me then how could you be my friend?"

Old heads taught me, ""Youngin, walk softly""
Carry a big clip that'll get niggas off me
Keep coke in coffee, keep money smellin' mothy
Chains is cool to cop, but more important is lawyer fees (Uh)
That's how it is now (Uh), that's how it always be (Uh)
I never change, this is always me
From the womb to the tomb, from now 'til my doom
Drink Army from one cup, pass it around the room (That's a family, nigga)
That's the ritual (Yup), Big Ran, I ain't forget you, fool
And all that bullshit you tryin' to get through
This is crew love, move music or move drugs
Rival crews, get your black suits up, I'll never change"
Havoc	7	Let a Ho Be a Ho	Murda Muzik	1999	[Verse 2]	"Chillin' at her crib, layin' in my boxers
While shorty got bent spittin' the latest gossip
Didn't want to hear it, in the middle cut her off
Lit a stog, smacked her on the ass, grabbed her by the draws
Bugged in the head, but her looks turned me on
She tried to turn me on with edible thongs
Plus I like the way she sounded when repeatin' my songs
From Queens to get to her crib, didn't take long
Said she had a man, but was locked up in Attica
Freaked off with the VCR to my camera
After that shit that happened to 2Pac
Yell rape, show 'em the tape, just playin' my part
Opposed to being on tape, but the G that I ran
Had her tongue in my ear and my dick in her hand
When I thought I knew I shoulda brought my fam
Bring her to the lowest level and shared it with my mans"

Chuck and gunnin' for dough
You want to score
But you really don't know how to to ball
I put you on
It was me that introduced you to wealth
Crossin' me is like shootin' yourself
Wanna blow so fast, now do it yourself
You ain't shit now
You was so ill, why you never came out?
Where ya clique now?
Where you sit now? In the back seat
Mad 'cause I flip styles and I pack heat
Make you run laps like a pro athlete
And I done that
From my experiences
I appear relentless
Take more time
Just to hear my sentence
I'ma tell you what's real
And what could stop you from makin a mil'
You could prevent this
When niggas don't see eye to eye to you
Lie to you
Wanna get high with you
Want to eat food off of your labor
And take food off your table
'Cause they don't see your vision
Don't understand your mission
Is to make history
While you here
How long you plan on livin'?
Not forever
At least to 140

Motown off Berry Gordy

Better watch what you say to these niggas
Cause you already know what they 'bout""
Put the game in a choke in a knot
Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out
Put that hook on her, now she got love in the south
I got some purp on me now
Stacking these styrofoams up by the double
They done let me back in, now they know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget, but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
I float off the Earth in designer
I’m working on having some manners
I’m thinking about it right now
I’m holding the cash while I pour up the lean
Then I put one in the air"

But I got my Smith and Wesson 'cause I'm gettin' grown
And their lookin' at your little boys success
And I been thinkin', I'm dealin' with too much stress
So I stay up on my P's and Q's
And watch out for the G's and fools
'Cause the homies that I thought I had
See me stackin' up a grip and they just started talkin' bad
So I stay away from outsiders
And when I roll through, it makes 'em open they mouth wider
I used to think that you was my one and only homie"

They hate when the player game is wrong

I'm grabbin' brews, takin' fast swiggas
I get cash and stash figures and harass them bitch-ass niggas!
After you, your man'll get scarred next
And if your squad flex, I'm lettin' off like Bernhard Goetz
A TEC-9 is my utensil
Fillin' niggas with so much lead, they can use they dick for a pencil
I'm known for snatchin' purses and bombin' churches
I get more pussy by accident than most niggas get on purpose
I got drug spots from New York to Canada
'Cause Big L be fuckin' with more keys than a janitor"
Eminem	15	White America	The Eminem Show	2002	[Outro]	"So to the parents of America, I am the Derringer
Aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the *galf*​​ and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you, Ms. Cheney! Fuck you, Tipper Gore!
Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have! Fuck you!
Ha ha ha, I'm just playin', America
You know I love you"

Common	22	Heat	Like Water for Chocolate	2000	[Verse 1]	"Messenger in the Metropolis; apocalypse here and now
Niggas know the ledge, so they don't come near the style
I appear in clouds on some heaven to earth shit
Fake niggas drown the deeper the verse gets
Deep as a skinny girl's cunt - I surface with the purpose
To let y'all niggas know the demo
Voice is a instrument that's monumental
You couldn't fuck with the style if you was a nympho
Raised in the temple of Chi, taught to look into the eye
I identify with dobbs and weaves, and niggas makin' moves
That bob and weave, and niggas with jobs on the side sell weed
I feed off the hunger that a bum or abandoned child gets
Freaky, like Marv Albert, in outfits, by Chaka Givens
I lecture how I got God but don't got religion
Got a clip for these niggas on the net, sellin' my shit
Let's just say you Ramone and I'm Spit
In a habitat of Cadillacs and battle raps
And people that travel at the speed of need
Never agree with the ways of the world
Cats say anything - like they say to they girl
How you bringin' it when you sit Indian style?
Niggas know me as Com, it's time hear me go wild
With hot shit, yeah
Hot shit, yeah, one, two
Came to bring it boy"

I got the seat reclined, fo-five under the white-T, smothered
Dippin' down Green Leaf, I ain't got no enemies
Been shot five times, now I bleed Hennessy
And bang for my niggas locked up, they can't stop us
It ain't a gangsta party 'til we go and dig Pac up
I'm Dr. Martin Luther King with two guns on
Hughey P. Newton with Air Force One's on
I gangbang but I'm the opposite of Tookie Williams

""You risked that for Blue?""

Cherubs and cerebellum
Terror at Sarah's wedding, Sam marrying Sam

If that sickens you, you a bigot
If it doesn't, well then you're wicked
Such is life, odd as Egg McMuffins at night
No answers, so let us watch these dancers
Structure reformed gracefully being born
On the pallet of dark grays, concaves and spirals
Kaleidoscope into a Eiffel
It ripples then it tidals, vacillates then it virals
Babylons then it Bibles and others
And tell me of the spinning mothers
And today's mathematics for beloved
And beasts' bellies covered like the cummerbunds of butlers"

Common	22	It’s Your World (Part 1 & 2)	Be	2005	[Verse 2]	"Life and death flow around us
Four pounds and pounds of herb from out of towners
It's hard to stay grounded
We stay high, that's why old folks down us
Lost, nobody found us, the force that surrounds us
Ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us
We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures
Removed from Earth, only to return through birth
Knew this girl sellin' her body, wish she knew what it was worth
Between God and trash, lookin' in every car that pass
With a walk that suggests head, to milk niggas she was breastfed
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads
Kinda scary, amongst thieves and base-heads
Said it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt
She was cold turk, growin' up she got to know hurt
Very well in a world where self hate is overt
Her stepfather thought he was Ike, so her mother he strike
She got to like like-minded niggas, who liked crimes and figures
Doin' white lines and liquor, see, hard times had kicked her
In the ass, it used to be thicker
Life is fast, some choose to be quicker
I remember in high school she had a passion to sing
Now she see herself in a casket in dreams
These are the children of crack and rap, blacks that lack
Self-esteem, yo we forgot the dream
On our Jeffersons y'all but we forgot the theme
In the Chi, we even rootin' for a garbage team
This queen never seen herself on this Corner
She still wanna see California
But this is her world"

Shorty dancin’ like she knows
She's the baddest in the place, hey, hey
I wanna get with you (Freak, don't fail me now, hey)
So what you wanna do?
Got her freakum dress on
Them New Bs on her feet

Thieves can't break in your crib and leave in that good life too

I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbors' hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up, bitches, with these hedge-trimmin' scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this mess
And make the best of this situation, I guess
'Cause I feel like a little bitch, this predicament's
Despicable, I'm sick of just gettin' pushed, it's ridiculous
I look like a frickin' wuss, a pussy
This kid just took my stick of licorice
And threw my sticker books in a picker bush
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
This fucker was twelve and was six foot, with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell, I got back up, all I did was book
Now there's usin' your head, momma always said"

Boa constricted, on my soul that they coil"

You all alone in these streets, cousin
Every man for they self in this land we be gunnin'
And keep them shook crews runnin', like they supposed to
They come around, but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face, you're in the wrong place
Cowards like you just get they whole body laced up
With bullet holes and such
Speak the wrong words, man, and you will get touched
You can put your whole army against my team and
I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin'
Your simple words just don't move me
You're minor, we're major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player
Don't make me have to call your name out
Your crew is featherweight, my gunshots'll make you levitate
I'm only nineteen, but my mind is old
And when the things get for real, my warm heart turns cold
Another nigga deceased, another story gets told
It ain't nothin' really, ayo Dun, spark the Philly
So I can get my mind off these yellow-backed niggas
Why they still alive? I don't know, go figure
Meanwhile back in Queens the realness and foundation
If I die, I couldn't choose a better location
When the slugs penetrate, you feel a burnin' sensation
Gettin' closer to God in a tight situation now
Take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you"

Or friend then, knowing the cost of rebuilding and carrying on
It gets so damn hard in this modern day Babylon
And disease runs rampant, so many men carry arm
So many have a lonely painful road to travel on
Mothers losing sons, improper use of guns
Children go astray because their parents were abusive ones
I used to run with the illest guys
Through the realest eyes
I seen the realest and the illest die
The cycle continues, so many times the good ones
The young ones
So many misunderstood ones
Remembering their faces and voices
And when the wise man said
Life is full of choices
Some get caught up, others are innocent victims
All I know is they were close to us, and that we miss them"

You cut 'em once he keep fighting, fuck it just keep cutting 'em
It's real killa instinct, kill or be killed
Trust me, you don't wanna feel how hollow tips feel
Fuck around and get your cap peeled, nigga you know the drill
Brownsville, Flatbush, Crown Heights, Brooklyn Zoo
Feed the wolves, they eat the food and the hand that feed 'em too
Nigga welcome to the jungle, New York, New York
Gangstas use sign language and let their guns talk
Look homie, I'm cool with some Bloods, I'm cool with some Crips

Used to chastise or string us up to spite niggas
War to fight for the culture, instead we eaten by vultures
They mix us like mimosas, hang us on wanted posters
Ask for license and registration with they gun out the holster
Some of us guilty, some of us not, some of us filthy rich
Others just watch us niggas drive up the block
We think we keeping it one hundred coming back to the hood
They think we flossin' money, so they pull a ratchet: what's good?
It happens in Compton, happens in Queens, happened to Big L
Happened to Chinx and 2Pac in that passenger's seat
Sometimes it's internal, happens to you before you happen to blink
What's beef? Cops killing niggas dead in the streets
So before we look outside, we gotta look within
Cause, now, we the dinosaurs, I think the world 'bout to end"

So I won't be seen by none of the homies, but
The homie Nate Dogg spots me and say, ""Yo, what's happenin'?
Oh, you don't know me no mo'?"", and passed me the satin
I said ""Aww, naw! It ain't like that, G
I'm tryin' to go straight and have a J-O-B""
""You need to quit that faggot ass job"", that's what he said
Showed me his grip and took some satin to the head
Damn! That nigga had at least two G's
And he was clockin' it wit' so much ease
I told him I was gone, so I'm headin' in the house
Everybody knocked out, so I'm locked out
I go back to the front where my homies is hangin' at
They offer me a cavi sack so I can start slangin' dat

Hold dat thought and I'll think about it 'cause..."

Over and over you hurt me, my love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up; when you down, they got nothing to say
But when you call up, I come running, I always take the pain away
They set you up to let you down; they crowned you prom queen
They know 'bout me; behind your back, they call you a fucking fiend
Can we just be alone so I can kiss and hug you?
Push me inside you; no other man can love you like I do
Call me Daddy, I'll make you feel good, I mean, real good
I find pleasure in pleasing you like a real man should
It was written long before us; it was carved in a tree
Forever, me and you, baby, we were meant to be
There's more to life than laughter; what brought us together was fate
And we'll be hand in hand when you walk through those pearly gates
And to see to that, I'ma do whatever it takes"

Not a day goes by, don't get high, don't ask why
Tonight's the night for me to rip microphones
Into bits and pieces — lyrical telekinesis
Gets me into verbally vindictive
Violent vocabulary vibes to existence
Catch me in the pitch-black path
I sit and let the sick thoughts pass
Through my mental 'til I hear an instrumental
And detrimental verbals get to spittin'
The highest in intellect, try connect it wit' the written
Now they faced wit' the forbidden, vocally chosen
To explore new terrain, then remain unseen throughout the war
Dips like a lo'-lo', wit' my verbal fo'-fo'
The cocoa complexion MC wit' the slow flow
Fo' sho'! I takes it to you from the do'
Muthafucka! Mentally, I go hardco' (You know!)
I disconnect ya, Kurupter
MC to vocally void your whole molecular structure
Catastrophic, mystic as Mxyzptlk
Hittin' MC's like pits, the deadliest lyricist"

JAY-Z	6	Marcy Me	4:44	2017	[Verse 2]	"Marcy me
Streets is my artery, the vein of my existence
I'm the Gotham City heartbeat
I started in lobbies, now parley with Saudis
I'm a Sufi to goofies, I could prolly speak Farsi
That's poetry, reek of coca leaf in my past
Came through the bushes smellin' like roses
I need a trophy just for that
Old Brooklyn, not this new shit, shit feel like a spoof
Fat laces in your shoe, I'm talkin' bustin' off the roof, uh
Hold a Uzi vertical, let the thing smoke
Y'all flirtin' with death, I be winkin' through the scope
Shout out to all the murderers turned murals
Plural, fuck the Federal Bureau
Shout out to Nostrand Ave., Flushing Ave., Myrtle
All the County of Kings, may your ground stay fertile
Shout out to Big Poppa, Daddy Kane, heroes
Thus concludin' my concerto
Marcy me"
Nas	9	Come Get Me	Nastradamus	1999	[Chorus]	"If you ill, come get me 'cause I ain't runnin'
If your gun's off the hook, then we'll both be gunnin'
Come get me if you real 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war, and I'm well prepared
If you ill, come get me 'cause I ain't runnin'
If your gun's off the hook, then we'll both be gunnin'
Come get me if you real 'cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war, we can take it there"
Dr. Dre	1	Express Yourself	Straight Outta Compton	1988	[Verse 2]	"Now, gettin' back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressin' ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin
Again and again and again — yo, you on the other end
Watch a brother blend dope rhymes with no help
There's no fessin' and guessin' while I'm expressin' myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants 'em to be, but not me
Ruthless is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
Though some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
Yeah, they want reality, but you won't hear none
They'd rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs and take a stand
But after the show, they go lookin' for the dopeman
Or they ban my group from the radio
Hear N.W.A and say ""Hell no!""
But you know, it ain't all about wealth
As long as you make a note to.."
Eric B. & Rakim	14	What’s On Your Mind	Don’t Sweat the Technique	1992	[Verse 3]	"Now it's been months and it's smooth and lovely
I'm in your head so you'll be thinkin' of me
So we met in Queens and went to Valley Streams
And, uh, couldn't remember the movie we just seen
But it's Wednesday, take the train uptown
How do 125th street sound?
Amateur night, Showtime at the Apollo
Probably be watchin' Bill Cosby tomorrow
Then after that get into it, I mean intimate
Every word is an instrument
Makin' sounds and tones and songs and moans
My lips so close to your ear, it's like headphones
She smiled and said ""You never know what the day will bring
It's always a new song to sing""
The next day, I went back to her rest
Knocked on the door, intentions — finesse
She let me in and had nothin' but a negligee on
Smellin' like Liz Claiborne
I sat down and got comfortable and watched the Huxtables
She sat next to me and said ""What's up wit' you?""
I got the feelin' for sexual healin'
A mental healin', how you feelin'?
She caught the effect and said she feel the same
Could you massage my intellect and stop the pain?
Desire's yearnin', the fire's burnin'
You hot 'cause it's a lot you're learnin'
Now I'm ready to explore you inner world
It's take a long time 'cause I'm just beginnin', girl
Take it easy, cut off the TV
Cut off the lights, use your mind to see me
Use your physical form if I'm hard to find
'Cause now I know what's on your mind"
Future	30	Stick Talk	DS2	2015	[Verse 2]	"I'ma tell a lie under oath
I can see it in your eyes, you're going broke
Oxycontin got her with a body count (sak pase)
Riding in a car I barely can pronounce
Ordered up a chauffeur, told him, ""ride me round the whole world""
I was on the E-way with that molly and that old girl
Get a little cheaper, you could win
Hit it little harder, get the Benz"
Lupe Fiasco	23	ON FAUX NEM	DRILL MUSIC IN ZION	2022	[Verse 4]	"Giving you a fourth, wanna make up for the first
Only 'cause I know that you can take another verse
Want the Quran to be a lie 'cause Hell sounds like it hurts
Also want it to be real 'cause Heaven sounds like it's turnt
Wear my conscience like a condom 'cause I don't wanna be burnt
Wear my dharma like its armor 'cause I don't wanna return
To the wheel of the quivering meat conception
Sometimes I hide inside Kerouac for protection
From the Thanksgiving where bears attacking the dressing
Like Tekken, just lean back and tear into that refreshment
Sometimes real life parallaxes in depression
That's real
Maybe not lie, maybe just chill (Yo)
Maybe not die, maybe just kill (Wait, no)
Maybe survive making a mil'
Greetings wavy but wavy don't make you a Navy SEAL"
Dr. Dre	1	Darkside/Gone	Compton	2015	[Verse 3]	"I went from hanging out down at the swap meet
To driving some of the hottest cars L.A. has ever seen
People been tellin' me I've grown into some kind of monster
But they don't know me though, I've been this way since seventeen
Tryna get finances poppin', man, I thought that was the object
'Til some of my niggas lost they life and then there goes the team
My only dream was holding it down, like, fuck who tryna stop us
You could get the middle finger or the reddest beam
It's your choice, I took this industry by storm, young and black
Killing them softly
Don't ever call me fortunate, you don't know what it cost me
So anybody complaining about they circumstances lost me, homie
We ain't even talkin', fuck that energy, fuck up off me, ugh!"
Snoop Dogg	0	Signs	R&G (Rhythm & Gangsta): The Masterpiece	2004	[Chorus]	"Don't think about it, boy, leave her aloneNigga, you ain't no G

Rakim	10	How I Get Down	The Master	1999	[Chorus]	"That's how I get down, so tell me how you like that
I hit the town, hold it down on a tight track
I start a party now - everybody like rap
Haters are mad cause they gave the R the mic back"
Eminem	15	So Much Better	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Chorus]	"My life would be so much better
If you just dropped dead (I hate you)
I was layin' in bed last night, thinkin'
And then this thought just popped in my head (You made me like this way)
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier
If you dropped dead? (Bitch)
I would feel so much, much better"

Scarface	11	Goin’ Down	The Diary	1994	[Verse 1]	"Hey, today must be my lucky day
I turned the corner, hit the block and seen that ass from a mile away
(now where's she staying?) she must be new in the hood
But I ain't trippin' on that shit, cause it's all good
I rolled up on her, and I asked her her name
Ain't a damn thing changed, ain't no shame in my game
She said, "" Used to go Thomas""
I slowed my roll, cause she just might be one of my homies' babies mamas
Now where your man at, she said ""Gone at work""
Gave me the look, I cracked a smile and thinkin', ""Go on and flirt""
My homies women ain't no thing to me
Cause if they caught one of my ho's, they'd do the same to me
And furthermore, she was peepin' my ride
Convertible, 64, with the ride inside
Super clean with the discs and vogues
Higher than a fuck spittin' this to hoes:"
Kendrick Lamar	16	King Kunta	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Verse 2]	"The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor

Rest in peace Ill Will, now your name's on the throne
And we gon' rep it the best that we can
Physically, you was killed by the weapons of man
But where you at now, you lamp, laid and max now
Where Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend
And they don't understand how you CEO from heaven
But that's another level, brethren
Two G's, we got the type fam with MAC-11's
We do squeeze, thought it's not right
But that's the zone that we left in
Bentleys, Porches, Piaget watches
Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks topless
Laptops with a 100 gigabytes, ninja bikes
And we all roll dice for each other's ice
Now how did one guy multiply to more than five wise guys?
But all in one man, only the mind's eye can understand that I'm..."
2Pac	18	I Get Around	Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...	1993	[Verse 1]	"Back to get wrecked, all respect
To those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
‘Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why your girl keeps pagin' me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me—lady, take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo, bust it, baby got a problem saying ""Bye-bye""
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask ""Why?"", don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's lookin' for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy, if you wanna see me
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
When will ya learn you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out: I get around"

I'm feelin' like, I'm finna fly
Right in the sky, unidentified
Flying object, that I sit inside
You can get a ride, just get in line
Hand by your heart, like memorize
Ask Scotty please, could you energize?
Beam on up, to the Enterprise
From the inner city, or the Windy City
Where's Mini-mini? Not Mini-me's
Only Mini-me's, not a lot of hymns
Only one eye, whole lot of them
Saw a cyclops, that's a eye clock
Like a Rolex, with a eye patch
See what I got, matches on the wall
Plus a crazy flow, suicide watch
I'm just killin' time, plus I'm insane
In a straight jacket, but it's Romanelli
I'm just gettin' back, for now it's kinda poor
Want to have things, couldn't afford a Pelle
So don't mind me, cause I ain't got a mind
I don't front hard, I ain't got a mind
I'm just gettin' mine, but don't step here
Because it's something buried, that I didn't find
And if I’m on top like a mohawk
I remember when, I was so not
It was no locks, man I couldn't ball
I was so bald, Robocop
I was Mr. Clean, now I'm Mr. T
But a different team, F&F rules
Call me F.I., from the Westside
And I'm underground, pepperin' you fool (yeah homey)"
Snoop Dogg	0	2001	Tha Doggfather	1996	[Verse 3]	"They say once upon a time in the land of the loccs
Where it's all about dope and pistol smoke
I packs me a heavy calibre .38 revolver
Weed out, DP'd out, GC'd out
Oh, did you not know
Snoop wit the .44 knockin at'cha door
We the passion for smashin and mashin the masses
Knockin' niggas like Cassius, Dogg Pound Gangsta assassin
It's like in a action
Cos for the cash in my own zone we known for blastin
Bustin, no need for discussion
We don't discuss, we stay close as 10 inches then bust
Close enough to touch then rush
Clean and radical and get clutch
The Dogg is the Don like killer Corleone
Free the D-O-double G with the solid gold bone"
JAY-Z	6	Lucifer	The Black Album	2003	[Verse 2]	"Yes, this is holy war, I wet y'all all with the holy water
Spray from the Heckler-Koch automatic
All the static, shall cease to exist
Like a sabbatical, I throw couple at you, take six!
Spread love, to all of my dead thugs
I pour out a little Louis, 'till I head above
Yessir, and when I perish, the meek shall inherit the Earth
'Til that time, it's on and popping, church
Like Don Bishop, the fifth or palm cock either
Lift up your soul or give you the holy ghost
Please I leave you in somebody's cathedral for stunting like Evel Knievel
I'll let you see where that bright light leads you
The more you talk, the more you irking us
The more you gon' need memorial services
The Black Album, second verse, is like
Devil's pie, save some dessert for us"

Pop anything to find that alley
Mhm, yeah, to find that alley (Mhm)"
Big Boi	26	ATLiens	ATLiens	1996	[Verse 3]	"Every day I sit while my nigga be in school
Thinking about the second album at The Dungeon shooting pool
Like E-S to the P-N, cause we adjust to the beat in the zone (zone)
Honey, I'm home but I'm not married
Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
And now I'm sitting at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team, and like your daddy's wife be making that coffee
You heard the ATLiens, so back the hell up off me"
Dr. Dre	1	Fuck Wit Dre Day (And Everybody’s Celebratin’)	The Chronic	1993	[Verse 3]	"Luke's bending over

 (What up?), 
If it ain't another ho that I gots to fuck with
Gap teeth in your mouth, so my dick's gots to fit
While you're on stage rappin' at your wack-ass concert
And I'ma snatch your ass from the backside
And show you how Death Row pull off that who-ride
'Cause I'ma rob you in Compton and blast you in Miami
 as I steps in the temple
Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap
Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat

Prodigy	8	Man Down	Hell On Earth	1996	[Verse 1]	"Here come the vultures, the Mobb-laced potent rap shit
Perhaps, kid, make it happen, start the flipping
You fuckin' comic, who you kidding?
My niggas laughing, blood bathin', the world's greatest
Infamous crimes heinous
To interfere would be dangerous
Plain and simp', stand clear, save your strength
You couldn't go the length if you was coked up
Bombazee'd up, whatever the fuck
Who gives a fuck? You get fucked
My coalition specialize in collision
The clash of the cliques
The duel of the iron, MAC spit
And leave you half-split
You'll be missin' much more than a fraction
When it's time for action
Hit him while he man down, make that nigga backspin
Trapped up by New Yiddy madmen
We blastin', you collapsin'
Heavily like my gold MAC-10
Get imprisoned with them raps'll have you relapsin'
You get cast in the Mobb, man, for askin'
We face splashin', dope fake's icepick stabbing
He slow leakin', eternally bleedin' for speakin'
Outta place, niggas get placed back indecent
Live at the main event, may I present
And scream it out loud for any Squad that's Def
My Infamous Mobb, your heart throb, hold your breath
He's KO'd from dead-arm rights and hard lefts
Another satisfied consumer who got blessed
Single out your army 'til there's no man left"

Kanye West	5	All Falls Down	The College Dropout	2004	[Verse 2]	"Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some 1s that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	Eric B. Is President	Paid in Full	1986	[Bridge]	"Make 'em clap to this

Nas	9	Life We Chose	Nastradamus	1999	[Verse 2]	"Uhh, what's love when you don't give your man enough dough?
He wanna stick you
What's love, you got beef?
Nobody rolling with you
What's love, you locked up, and your family don't care
Is love a four-letter word, that deceives the ear?
What's real, when you know your man's girl is a ho
And you don't even let him know, 'cause you fucked her befo'
What's real, when you talk behind a man's back
Then you see him and give him dap, now explain that?
What's trust, when they separate your case
When you at your court date, your co-de', can't look in your face
What's trust, when you keep your wife away from your man?
And he never crossed you, but you claiming he's fam'?
What's trust, when you get bust, your niggas don't retaliate?
They blaze purple haze with 'em the next day?
God forbid one of my niggas get hit, I'ma go haywire
Won't hesitate, I'ma spray fire
But everybody's different, you won't know how you react
Til you in that position, and that's an actual fact
The hearts of men change as time goes on, who's wrong?
You was hungry when you stuck Duke, he came back to buck you
Who's wrong? Foul all your life, now you 90
On your deathbed you regret being grimy
What's lust, a bust nut? What's a thug?
A ghetto child raised around drugs 'til he's old enough to bust slugs?
Then what's jail, to rehabilitate, or to make a nigga worse
When he come home to catch another case?
Life's about decisions, you choose it, you gotta live it
You did it, heaven or hell or prison
Who knows when your clock'll stop ticking, get your weight up
Save up before it's over neighbor, I told ya
You getting older player, look at those who gave up"

Stop the beat a minute! I got somethin' to say, Dre
I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin' weed is in me
I don't know if I ever told you this
But I love you, dog, I got your motherfuckin' back, just know this shit
I mean it, dog—you ever need somebody offed: ""Whose throat is it?""
Well, that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's mama
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin' at people (Hi!)
Then drop her off on the corner at the police station
And drive off, honkin' the horn for her (*Beep-beep!*)
Raw-dog, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed-off and beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
In they nose and cough snot up, mucus and hot water
That's for tryna talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
And you better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, ""I just don't give a fuck!"" and see who means it"

Life or death, we bangin' with soldiers, beware it if you scared
Then we torture you bastards for what the fuck you done done
Double-crossed this nigga, so now the war's on
We rob, strapped, bustin' until they all drop
Shit, we actually blowin' your bitch ass off the block
So keep your Glock clocked, sucker, for when I come through
Dumpin' rounds, slumpin' in your homie for nothin'
Twenty seconds 'til death, weed, alcohol on my breath
You looking for your fuckin' homies, ain't none left
Hangin' out with my niggas, real street niggas
They're hawkin' dope here, bust them triggers
Takin' flicks and pictures, martyrfyin' the street life
Drinkin' liquor, shermed out, high as a kite
Intoxicated, feelin' the feelin' that you can feel
When a car drive by suddenly and they was out to kill"

JAY-Z	6	Girls, Girls, Girls (Part 2)	The Blueprint	2001	[Verse 3]	"I'm lookin' for a Southern girl that cook like Patti LaBelle
Big ghetto booty, scarf over her doobie
Chanel under the Louis, Gucci over her booty
Vicky cover her titties, attitude of the city
Pretty, witty, girly, worldly
One who likes to party, but come home early
Light, kinda dark, short, sorta tall
Slim, kinda thick, I swear I love 'em all
She can cook the coke and got hook-up on the license
But she can get you first-class seats for coach prices
Isn't this great? My flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds"
2Pac	18	Trapped	2Pacalypse Now	1991	[Verse 2]	"They got me trapped, can barely walk the city streets
Without a cop harasskin' me, searching me, then askin' my identity
Hands up, throw me up against the wall, didn't do a thing at all
I'm telling you one day these suckers gotta fall
Cuffed up, throw me on the concrete
Coppers try to kill me, but they didn't know this was the wrong street
Bang bang, count another casualty
But it's a cop who's shot for his brutality
Who do you blame? It's a shame because the man's slain
He got caught in the chains of his own game
How can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me?
Sweated me, hunted me, trapped in my own community
One day I'm gonna bust, blow up on this society
Why did you lie to me? I couldn't find a trace of equality
Worked me like a slave while they laid back
Homie don't play that, it's time I let 'em suffer the payback
I'm tryin' to avoid physical contact
I can't hold back, it's time to attack, Jack"

'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear
That's rock bottom, when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom, when you want somethin' bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom, when you feel like you've had it up to here
'Cause you mad enough to scream, but you sad enough to tear"
Jay-Z	12	Coming of Age (Da Sequel)	Vol. 2… Hard Knock Life	1998	[Outro]	"Yeah, you done came up, put your life on the line
Soaked the game up, now it's yo' time to shine
Time to change up, no more second in line
Yeah, yeah

Eminem	15	Leaving Heaven	Music to Be Murdered By	2020	[Verse 2]	"I've been down, kicked
Like around six thousand times since I was a kid
As a child, picked on, clowned, been
Countless times I've been outed
Gotta remind myself of it every now and then (Yeah)
So the route I went's self-empowerment
In a hole, taught myself how to get out of it
And balance it with talents, wit
'Cause life is like a penny (Life is like a penny)
'Cause it's only one percent
Who overcome the shit they've underwent
I went AWOL like what my back was up against
Don't tell me 'bout struggle, bitch, I lived it
I was five or six the first time I got my hind end kicked
Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogie jumped me and took my tricycle
And I don't know if I would call that white privilege, yeah
But I get it, how it feels to be judged by pigment
Besides getting it from both sides of the tracks
But I swore I'd get them back
Even if it meant selling my soul to get my revenge and (What?)
Thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking
If I can believe in myself, I could prolly achieve it
That's part of the reason I do all my talking with ink
And as long as I'm breathing, I vow to outsmart 'em and beat 'em
A God with a heart of a demon, go at 'em and I'ma get even
Like I'm in the Garden of Eden, I'm 'bout to go off of the deep end
This evil is calling, I'm already seething and"
Nas	9	Carry On Tradition	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Verse 2]	"Now some of these new rappers got their caps flipped backwards
With their fingers intertwined in some gang-sign madness
I got an exam, let's see if y'all pass it
Let's see who can quote a Daddy Kane line the fastest
Some of you new rappers, I don't understand your code
You have your man shoot you, like in that Sopranos episode
Do anything to get in the game, mixtapes
You spit hate against bosses; hungry fucks are moralless
You should be tossed in a pit full of unfortunate vocalists
Niggas, I could've wrote your shit
I had off-time, was bored with this
I could've made my double-LP
Just by samplin' different parts of Nautilus
Still came five on the charts with zero audience
The lane was open and y'all was droppin' that garbage shit
Y'all got awards for your bricks – it got good to ya
You started tellin' them bigger dogs to call it quits?! WHAT?"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	I Know You Got Soul	Paid in Full	1987	[Verse 4]	"Now I'ma stop to see what you got
Get off the mic before I get too hot
I want to see which posse can dance the best
It should be easy 'cause the beat is fresh
Now if you're from Uptown, Brooklyn-bound
The Bronx, Queens, and Long Island Sound
Even other states come right and exact
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Since you came here, you have to show and prove
And do that dance until it don't move
'Cause all you need is soul, self-esteem will release
The rest is up to you, Rakim'll say peace"
Eminem	15	Still Don’t Give a Fuck	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Verse 2]	"I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast, when your blood spilled, it was still blue
I'll hang you 'til you dangle, and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb
'Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm, and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match (""Here, Momma, try 'em on"")
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
(Shittin' on rappers) Causing hospital accidents
God help me, before I commit some irresponsible acts again"
Kurupt	4	Bang	Doctor’s Advocate	2006	[Verse 1]	"Look nigga, I nurture and breed
I ain't never gave a fuck about a bitch's needs

I'ma lay 'em down, spray the 'K and get out"
The Game	13	100	The Documentary 2	2015	[Verse 3]	"Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil' Snupe, I was Meek Mill
Niggas know how it feel when you missin' your nigga though
Can't think, so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figuero'
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, ""Here it go""
Screamin' Frog name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool, but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter, dawg, cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga"

Big L	25	Street Struck	Lifestylez ov da Poor & Dangerous	1995	[Verse 1]	"Yo, where I'm from it ain't cookies and cream
There's a lot of peer pressure growin' up as a young teen
You never know when you gonna get wet
'Cause mad clowns be catchin' wreck with a Tec just to get a rep
Instead of cool friends, they'd rather hang with male thugs
Instead of goin' to school, they'd rather sell drugs
It's best to go the right route and not the wrong one
Because it's gonna catch up with you in the long run
Brothers be on the corners, actin' stupid, gettin' lifted
Their life is twisted, and most of them are quite gifted
In other words, they got talent
But they'd rather sell cracks and bust gats and run the streets actin' violent
To them it's all about hittin' skins and makin' some easy green
'Cause that's all they show you on the TV screen
All they care about is a buck or bustin' a sweet nut
They don't give a (What?) 'cause they're street struck"
Eminem	15	Brainless	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Chorus]	"""If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous"" (I'ma prove you wrong)
Momma, I'ma grow one day to be famous
And I'ma be a pain in the anus (I'ma be the bomb)
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness (Momma always said)
""Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous""
Guess it pays to be brainless"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	Lyrics of Fury	Follow the Leader	1988	[Verse 2]	"Terror in the styles, never error-files
Indeed, I'm known to exile
For those that oppose to be level or next to this
I ain't a devil and this ain't The Exorcist
Worse than a nightmare, you don't have to sleep or wink
The pain's a migraine every time you think
Flashbacks interfere, you start to hear
The R-A-K-I-M in your ear
Then the beat's hysterical
That makes Eric go get an axe and chops the wack
Soon the lyrical format is furier, faces of death remain
MCs decaying 'cause they never stayed
The scene of a crime every night at the show
The fiend of a rhyme on the mic that you know
It's only one capable, breaks the unbreakable
Melodies unmakeable, pattern unescapable
I haunt if you want, the style, I possess
I bless the child, the earth, the gods and bomb the rest
For those that envy an MC, it can be
Hazardous to your health, so be friendly
A matter of life and death, just like an Etch A Sketch
Shake 'til you're clear, make you disappear, make the next
After the ceremony, let a rhyme rest in peace
If not, my soul'll release
The scene is recreated, reincarnated, updated
I'm glad you made it
'Cause you're about to see a disastrous sight
A performance never again performed on a mic
Lyrics of fury
A furified freestyle"

Pearl Cadillac on D's and Vogues, flip flops, T-shirts and Dickies
It's the return of Billy Ocean, Cuervo is my drink
Stank, stank means you got the funkiest, dopest heat on the street

Deeper than sea fish in the O (Cean)
I got my gun on standby like Coast Guards
You boast hard, you'll get your salty ass crumbled like herb (Word, ayy, man)
You heard it here first, put your master plan in reverse
I ain't the one with the curse, so disperse
Yes, catching plagues, niggas catching AIDS
Niggas getting sprayed, niggas on they way
To a dead end, you won't catch me spreading no white thighs
I only see afro bitches up in my eyes
I don't eat no beef and surely not no pork
I used to drink that eight, but now I shove it down your throat
Quote, ""If they kill they own folks, what you think they gonna do to you?""
I'm outcasted and claiming true
Aiming two at your motherfucking spine
No, I make that three 'cause I don't wanna hear you whine, swine
Got my folks blind like Stevie

Andre Ben' slamming backs like King acts
Over Organized tracks full of facts

Well burn muthafucka burn American dreams
Don't everybody like the taste of apple pie?
We'll snap for yo' slice of life I'm tellin' ya why
I hear that Mother Nature now's on birth control
The coldest pimp be looking for somebody to hold
The highway up to Heaven got a crook on the toll
Youth full of fire ain't got nowhere to go, nowhere to go"
Nas	9	Take it in Blood	It Was Written	1996	[Verse 1]	"Yo, I never brag how real I keep it, 'cause it's the best secret
I rock a vest, prestigious Cuban link flooded Jesus
In a Lex, watchin' Kathie Lee & Regis
My actions are one with the seasons
A TEC squeezin' executioner
Winter time, I rock a fur
Mega popular center of attraction
Climaxin', my bitches, they be laughin'
They high from sniffin' coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson
City lights spark a New York night
Rossi and Martini sippin', Sergio Tacchini
Flippin' mad pies, low price, I blow dice and throw them
.45 by my scrotum, manifest the 'Do or Die' slogan
My niggas roll in ten M3's
Twenty gods poppin' wheelies on Kawasakis
Hip-hop's got me on some ol' sprayin' shots like a drum roll
Blankin' out, never miscount the shells my gun hold
I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite I separate, watchin' crab niggas marinate
I'm all about TEC's, a good jux and sex
Israelite books, holdin' government names from Ness
MC's are crawlin' out every hole in the slum
You be aight like blood money in a pimp's cum"
Snoop Dogg	0	Doggy Dogg World	Doggystyle	1993	[Verse 1]	"You know, some of these niggas is so deceptive
Usin' my styles like a contraceptive
I hope you get burnt, seems you haven't learnt
It's the knick-knack, paddywhack, I still got the biggest sack
So put your gun away, run away, 'cause I'm back (Why?)
Hit 'em up, get 'em up, spit 'em up
Now, tell me, what's going on?
It make me wanna holler, 'cause my dollars come in O-zones
Known for the break up, so take off your clothes
And quit tryna spit at my motherfuckin' hoes
Speakin' of hoes, I'll get to the point
You think you got the bomb 'cause I rolled you a joint?
You'se a flea, and I'm the Big Dogg
I'll scratch you off my balls with my motherfuckin' paws
Y'alls niggas better recognize (Uh-huh)
And see where I'm comin' from — it's still Eastside 'til I die
Why ask why?

Nas	9	I Gave You Power	It Was Written	1996	[Verse 1]	"I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab me, bullets spray
They use me wrong, so I sing this song to this day
My body is cold steel, for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats, they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches, four pounds, been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, living harshly
Beat up and battered
They pull me out, I watch as niggas scattered
Making me kill, but what I feel, it never mattered
When I'm empty, I'm quiet, finding myself fiending to be fired
A broken safety, niggas place me in shelves, under beds
So I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keeping me full up with hollow heads"
Kanye West	5	We Major	Late Registration	2005	[Verse 1]	"Feeling better than some head on a Sunday afternoon
Better than a chick that say ""Yes"" too soon
Until you have a daughter; that's what I call karma
And you pray to God she don't grow breasts too soon
Projects tore up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off, that's how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes? Just to blow up?
Get they first car and then, IRS show up
He ain't never had shit, but he had that nine
Nigga come through flicking and he had that shine
Put two and two together and a little bad weather
Gon' be your whole family on that funeral line
Asked the reverend, ""Was the strip clubs cool?
If my tips helped send a pretty girl through school?""
That's all I want, like winos want they good whiskey
I ain't in the Klan, but I brought my hood with me"

Lookin' for hoes and snitches was my thing on Player's Ball, yup

Smoked out is how I wanna end it on this track
So I pass it to my partner and step back up in my Cadillac"

Jewelry is ""shine"", if you in love that mean you ""blind""
Genuine is ""real"", a ""face card"" is a hundred dollar bill
A very hard, long stare is a ""grill""
If you sneakin' to go see a girl, that mean you ""creepin'""
Smilin' is ""cheesin'"", bleedin' is ""leakin'""
Beggin' is ""bummin'"", if you ""nuttin'"", you cummin'
Takin' orders is ""sonnin'"", an ounce of coke is a ""onion""
A hotel's a ""telly"", a cell phone's a ""celly""
Jealous is ""jelly"", your ""food box"" is your belly
To ""guerrilla"" mean to use physical force

Now tricks be looking at me like I'm they way up out the projects
Can't put you on my payroll, and no I ain't got no Rolex
Or no diamond; at the exit with a sign saying ""We'll rap for food""
My face is bawled up cause I ain't in a happy mood

'Cause I'm switchin' from side to side, lookin' for hoes and snitches
I'm wide open on the freeway, my pager broke my vibe

Go Uptown in The Bronx to Boogie Down
Get Strong on the Island, recoup and lay around
Time to build my juice back up

Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talkin' poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin' for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb and I can see power steerin'
Sex drive when you swerve, I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, mhm

My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car, then I tried to leave
And somethin' told me to keep it in park until I could see
The reason why he was mad at a stranger
Like I was supposed to save him
Like I'm the reason he's homeless and askin' me for a favor
He's starin' at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
He's starin' at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin' back at him, feelin' some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin' at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked

A humble man is all that we ever need""

Plus you better keep that mothafuckin' thing ridin' wit you
And if i feel you a threat to my well-being
Niggas is bleedin' you niggas better back up off the P kid
I blam you, and pass you to Jesus Christ
You be a Ghost Dog like Forest Whitaker wife

I got big four-pound towners
Give you New Balance"

Got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
Sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
'Cause even thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin'
I wanna take you to the movies and the park
A quiet spot for you to do me in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin' you right
You're lonely and depressed, you need a thug in your life
Enough talkin', you want me to leave I'll get to walkin'
See you later, 'cause baby, I'm a player, and all I heard was—"

Lil' Brad from out of South Acres, prone for scams
Never ducked the motherfucker, I was down for the dirt
Got respect from older cats cause I was down for the work
When Fondren had its Great Skate I'd roll to the club
Drunk off the bird with thumbtack holes in my glove
Stood in the corner waiting for bullshit to jump
And in the event it jumped you saw a fool get stomped
There it is, can't get this shit no realer than that
Had a super boxing game, but now I'm peeling your cap
I done been in fist fights with niggas twice my size
Got an incredible record, 27 and 5
And the 5 losses I got, I had to redeem 'em
So he had to fight me everytime I seen him
Ain't no pussy in me, I've been for real before this rap shit
I study MCs, that's how I know you hoes is plastic
So-a, shake your ass and I'mma tell 'em the truth
Fabricate your bumps and bruises homey, do what you do
Just remember who for real when they tell you they real
I survived the game of life nigga, fuck some skills"

Take kindness for a weakness, so I won't be so kind to
Niggas comin' through, I gave you birth, kid, I'm sonnin' you
The Infamous got PC for days
We runnin' through townships, fuckin' shit
Kid, we down shit
Hustle mad bricks, Queensbridge, no doubt, rep the clique
9-6, droppin' wild on some Benzes
Some next shit, crash bar, ask the God
I remember when loadin' up the gats, beef settlin'
Ghetto peddling the Sonder, shorty dead again
Songs about we all around the NC
Cop the E series, jealous ones envy
Hate to see me but got the nerve to wanna be me
I bleach blind 'em, you can't see like Stevie
I'm on TV, Vidbox and all that
Still in the Bridge, now what's fuckin' with that?"

P holds the pen tightly, explode nightly
I count on one finger all y'all rap niggas that excite me
Y'all niggas is trash rap - wanna fight me?
You shook to death, take breaths and step lightly
Y'all Little League niggas is so bald they might be
Spent too much time with wifey, come out to play
With the hard-headed, Infamous song torture
Crack your knuckles, buckle up your pants tight
Pull your hats down, let's get it on like papi bar fights
My spiral book, hold the world's most lethal
There's no cure, for what my pen do neither
Bring the fever, y'all niggas is the rap jesters
While we was gone for a moment, y'all kept the crowd goin' now
Move over bacon, time for some'in meatier
Your shit's weak, your best song was mediocre
Fuck a penis, how dare you entertain the thought
That you could come out to challenge me in blood talk?
Take a walk jerk, this ain't Levert, Sweat and Johnny Gill
This is rap for real, somethin' you feel
You catch a chill when you hear the Mobb bang through your stereo
It's heavy metal for the black people, rock'n'roll
But it's hip-hop though, my drug music
It's thereapeutic to the user, you slam dance to it"
Snoop Dogg	0	Vapors	Tha Doggfather	1996	[Verse 3]	"I got another homie from tha L-B-C
Known to y'all as DJ Warren G
He cut, scratch, transforms with finesse
(scratching) And all that mess
I remember when we first started to rock
He tried to get this job at Calvin's Record Shop
He was in it to win it, but the boss fronted
Said ""Sorry, Warren G, but there's no help wanted""
Now my homie Warren still tried
On and on and on til the like break of dawn
To work at tha V-I-P would be the lick
But they looked right past him so my homie straight dipped
Now for the year after Regulate
Warren G is having papers so my homie's like straight
He walked into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like ""Warren, welcome to my store""
Offering him a job, but nah he don't want it
Damn it feels good to see people up on it
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they caught since he busting
The vapors"

And the struggle must continue so it's on
Raised in a house full of bad motherfuckers
Mad motherfuckers, never had, so we grab
From the sad motherfuckers
Now they know me, the homies
Raised by some crazed ass well paid OG's
Ah shit! Pulled up in a Benzy, snatch
The wheel as I peel off catch
A cocktail, block sale's hit, raise a fist
So they know who make the hit
Can I flip it? I make it wicked as I rip it (Uh)
To get specific: if the shoe fits, then kick it
It's for the gifted, pump your fist if you with it
Here's your ticket to see Mr. Wicked rip shit
Now they wanna ban me (Told ya)
All I wanted to be was a soulja
Bang bang boogie, it's a stick up
Quit now, nigga, eat a dick up
Huh, I'm representin'"

The Game	13	Hustlers	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Verse 2]	"1995, eleven years from the day
I'm in the record shop with choices to make
Illmatic on the top shelf, The Chronic on the left, homie
Wanna cop both but only got a 20 on me
So fuck it, I stole both, spent the 20 on a dub sack
Ripped the package off Illmatic and bumped that
For my niggas it was too complex when Nas rhymed
I was the only Compton nigga with a ""New York State of Mind""
Inside the dope house, bottlin' up sherm
Bangin' The Firm, Dre was king then so I waited my turn
Fast forward, now I'm making 'em burn
Ended my peers' careers
Hollered at Nas, a hard lesson was learned
So I reconciled my differences like he did with Jigga
I stopped beefin' with niggas, ‘cause I'm ""Ether"" to niggas
Comb the earth 'til there's no one left
If I ruled the world I summons all you weak rap niggas to death"
Snoop Dogg	0	Play On Playa	Hip Hop Is Dead	2006	[Verse 3]	"It's kinda hard for a playa like you
But let me show you how a nigga like me get revenue
What you never do is punk out, what you better do
Never let the game get ahead of you, get a better view
Better yet, a better crew, praise God, I'ma marry you
Get ya holy, carry you, bury you, slowly
Roll me another blunt, stuff it
Lick it, puff it, tuck it, fuck it
That man, that game, that thing it busts
In D-O-Double-G we trust
Yup, yup, young loc with the two steps
He creepin' with two TEC's, they sleepin' with two chicks
Right before we blast, all you heard was two clicks (Bloaw!)
End of existence, for instance
Rewind, replay it, re-chop it, remix it, re-twist it
Goddamn, D-O-Double-G, cuz, we missed it
Travel slow, I'm an Indian, but not a Navajo
I smoke the big leaf, end all the big beefs
My hair in two braids, I'm the big chief
La-da-da, be-da-ba-da…
Yeah, break that down, how fresh you are?
The king from Queens, Mr. Escobar
Connect with the best from the West, yes-yes, you are
Oh my God, it's Snoop Dogg and Nas; playa, play on"
Common	22	Chi-City	Be	2005	[Verse 2]	"A black figure, in the middle with chaos and gunfire
So many raps about rims, surprised niggas ain't become tires
On the street you turn cold and then go screech
I tell 'em ""fuck 'em"" like I do to police
The beast is runnin' rampant
I'm in between sheets tryin' to have sex that's tantric
For the ghetto, tryin' to make a get-up stand-up anthem
You spit hot garbage son of Sanford
What you rappin' for to get fame or get rich?
I slap a nigga like you, and tell him ""Rick James bitch!""
With your Hollywood stories, on porches
We polly hood stories about who became rich
And whatever light they hit, we wanna hit the same switch
You didn't know where to aim it, you still remain bitch
I'm forever puttin' words together
Some'll sever mothers from daughters and fathers from sons
The name Com', has never been involved wit' run
Unless it's DMC, or runnin' these broads to bein' free
I'm harder than the times, you hardly scary
Holdin' gats inside, you cats is Halle Berry
They ask me where hip-hop is goin', it's Chicago-in
Poetry's in motion like a picture now showin'
It's the city, the city, y'all
The city (Uh)
The city, y'all, come on"
Guru	20	DWYCK	Hard to Earn	1992	[Verse 2]	"I chant, ""Eeny, meeny, miny, moe""
I wreck the mic like a pimp pimps hoes
Here's how it goes, I am a genius, I mean this
I shape this, you'll tape this, I'm kind of fiendish
You wish that you could come into my neighborhood
Meanin' my mental state, still I'm five foot eight
Crazy as I wanna be 'cause I make it orderly
You could say I'm sort of the boss, so get lost
The brother who will make you change opinions
Dominions, I'm in them when it's time to kick shit from the heart
Plus, I get a piece of the action
Feelin' satisfaction from the street crowd reaction
Chumps pull guns when they feel afraid
Too late, when they dip in the kick, they get sprayed
Lemonade was a popular drink and it still is
I get more props and stunts than Bruce Willis
A poet like Langston Hughes and can't lose
When I cruise out on the expressway
Leavin' the bodega, I say ""Suavé""
Premier's got more beats than barns got hay
Clips are inserted into my gun
So I can take the money, never have to run"
Nas	9	U Wanna Be Me	8 Mile	2002	[Verse 3]	"You can't be me, I'm trying to walk a straight line
Why they trying to take mine? I'm past 8 Miles of every state line
Eating, alligators and, hummingbird hearts
At the Player's Ball, Brioni suits, y'all birds watch
As real millionaire, shit'll take place
Evil as Hitler's hate-race people
This is God son, and I've come from the God under pure peace
To represent the streets, you'll see that my plan
Is not to destroy your man
But to bring more to mankind and teach
Every MC reach for your pens and papers
Lesson one be creative; what you made of junior?
Cause soon you'll be a grown man with the mic in your hand
And understand, to battle Nas not in your plan
I'm the last real nigga alive, understand that
And you my offspring, the boss sting
A bulletproof Porsche things, hard for you to understand that
Nas the king, where my bricks, where my band at?
Play me a gangster's theme, while you entertain me
If I ain't crying laughing, to the lions, throw your ass in
What the fuck was you niggas thinking?
Guns'll clutch if I get a inkling that you coming for the kingpin
But I laugh at you cowards, ha ha ha
Take me out, try try try, but you"

I know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pullin' TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gon' spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?
In the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around
Hommo shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Just Might Be OK	Lupe Fiasco’s Food & Liquor	2006	[Verse 3]	"Then he leaves the house that love built that
HUD renovated that section 8 pays for
Well let's pray for em, let the beat play for em
Put his struggles on display for em
Cause he gotta go and face the drama
With a different face from the one that he use
To face his momma, if you look close you'll see
It consist of a smile that hurts, an ice grill, and a trace of trauma
Little bit of his father, another criterion
That's no different from a young Liberian
Who let the delirium weary him, living in the inner city
Out of his mind, liria reconcilia
I'm cool, I don't foretell best
I ain't nicest MC, I ain't Cornel West
I am Cornel Westside, Chi-town Guevara
Malcolm eXorcise the demons, gangsta leaning
He traded in his kufi for a New Era
Chose a 44 over a mortarboard
I ain't a credited institute graduate, I ain't from Nazareth
My conception wasn't immaculate, I ain't master no calculus
A good addition to the rap audience
I back flipped on the mattress they slept on me on
Whaddown Joe, knowing is half the battle
Fighting temptation, have an apple
Shakes the snakes, pip the system
Let's get into it, tabernacle"
Eric B. & Rakim	14	Musical Massacre	Follow the Leader	1988	[Verse 1]	"How could I keep my composure?
When all sorts of thoughts fought for exposure?
Release, then veins in the brains increase
When I let off, make a wish and blow the smoke off my piece
Unloadin', unfold and the rhymes are explodin'
And the mic that I'm holding's golden
Cordless 'cause the wire caught fire like a fuse
Gunpowder and the slightest bruise is a friction
The outcome is near, so listen, here's a brief description:
A boom and flame and smoke, ashes are dust to dust
Contact is compact when I bust
MC's are now in a massacre, a disaster, a master at fashion, I
Beat to death, to a pulp 'til it can't pump
Speakers ain't sayin' nothin', now the ball can thump
As I'm lookin', I stand like brick buildings in Brooklyn
Then the stage is took, then
Havoc struck that could product a holocaust
Keep in touch the mic when you're holdin' yours
Huffin' and puffin' and slobbin' and droolin'
Nothing's pumpin', who do you think ya foolin'?
Tommy Tucker? The neighborhood sucker?
What you oughta do, is pick up a tempo
From what I invent, so hard not to bite, but you can't prevent, so
You start to kidnap, I watch a kid rap
When he get off, he know he shouldn't have did that
Minor, old-timer, weak rhymer, stay in liner
You won't be inclined to go so, yo
Maybe later, you're gonna be
But for now, you're almost one of me
Now, the immature imitation's taken from originations
Made by changin' and a little arrangin'
So, perform, if ya still ain't warm, maybe after a roast
By the host with the most, it's a Musical Massacre"

Currency means nothin' if you still ain't free
Money breeds jealousy, take the game from me
I hope for better days, trouble comes naturally
Runnin' from authorities 'til they capture me
And my aim is to spread mo' smiles than tears
Utilize lessons learned from my childhood years
Maybe Mama had it all right, rest yo' head
Tradin' conversations all night, bless the dead

Catch a brother at the crossroads
Plus nobody knows my soul, watchin' time pass
Through the glass of my drop-top Rolls; hold ya head!"

Huh, two ATMs (Hah, hah, hah, hah)

Gang Starr	21	Moment of Truth	Moment of Truth	1998	[Chorus 1]	"They say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you

We all must meet our moment of truth"
Jay-Z	12	Ain’t No Nigga	Reasonable Doubt	1996	[Verse 1]	"I keep it fresher than the next, bitch
No need for you to ever sweat the next bitch
With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit, indeed
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me
You get the keys to the Lexus with no driver
You got your own '96 somethin' to ride
And keep your ass tight up in Versace, that's why
You gotta watch your friends, you got to watch me, they connivin'
Shit, the first chance to crack the bank, they try me
All they get is 50 cent franks and papayas
From the village to the telly, time to kill it on your belly no question
Had more black chicks between my sheets than ""Essence""
They say sex is a weapon
So when I shoot, meet your death in less than 8 seconds
Still poundin' in my afterlife
Laughin', my shit is tight, who you askin', right?"
Kendrick Lamar	16	No Make-Up (Her Vice)	Section.80	2011	[Verse 1]	"I know she 'bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful and how long it took
For you to put it on, it was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
Of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown
Damn girl, why so much?
You 'bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing?
From Heaven is where you got it from
I love your smile, you can do it without style
From your lips all the way to your eyebrows
It's the beauty in her, but when the makeup occur
I don't see it, all I see is a blur"
Kendrick Lamar	16	Alright	To Pimp a Butterfly	2015	[Outro]	"I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes

Dark nights in my prayers"
Travis Scott	33	THANK GOD	UTOPIA	2023	[Verse 1]	"I won't doubt it, I won't

Havoc	7	Give Up the Goods (Just Step)	The Infamous	1995	[Verse 3]	"Yo, ain't no time for fakin' jax
'Cause brothers that fake jax get laid on they backs
The streets is real, can't roll without steel
I feel how I feel 'cause I was born to kill
Do what I gotta to eat a decent meal, brothers is starvin'
Don't try to find a job, son, it's all about robbin'
So don't be alarmed when we come through
We supposed to, if you opposed to, get your face blown, dude!
Off the map, 'cause I react, attack
A brother wasn't blessed with wealth, so I act like that
Drug dealin', only mess with shorties that's appealin'
I'm frontin' on the world once I start 4-wheelin'
'Cause back on the 41st Side, we do it right
Sippin' E&J, gettin' bent all night
Yo, who that?! I never seen him in my whole life
Step to his business 'cause it's only right
Po-po ain't around, so I grab my pound
Money retaliated, so I hit the ground
My life is on the line, gotta hold my projects down
Can't see myself gettin' bodied by a clown
Ass nigga that ain't even from my town
Hit him up in the chest, now he's layin' man down
Jetted up from under the benches, I started hearin' sirens
I stopped firin', to cut ass like a diamond
Jetted to the crib piece, what a relief
Stashed the heat, then proceeded to peep
Out the window, called my son, ""Yo, son, we got beef!""
But no question, money had a problem so I solved him"
Eminem	15	97' Bonnie & Clyde	The Slim Shady LP	1999	[Chorus]	"Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride

And when we ride
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I (See, honey)"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Kick, Push	Lupe Fiasco’s Food & Liquor	2006	[Verse 2]	"My man got a little older, became a better roller
Yeah, no helmet, hell bent on killing himself
Is what his mama said, but he was feeling himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend, she was clapping in the crowd
Love is what-what was happening to him now, ugh!
He said ""I would marry you
But I'm engaged to these aerials and varials
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two""
She said ""Bow! I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds"" (Woo!)
""Now, let me make one thing clear
I don't need to ride yours, I got mine right here""
So she took him to a spot he didn't know about
Some odd-end apartment parking lot
She said ""I don't normally take dates in here""
Security came and said ""I'm sorry, there's no skating here"""
Daz Dillinger	2	Blueberry	Tha Doggfather	1996	[Verse 2]	"My mind-state these days make the average nigga afraid
Hurt 'em in the worst way, put it down for myself
Put 'em to rest, confess, nevertheless
Snatch 'em a cap and destroy 'em at my best
For the simple fact with contact, we the block entourage
We drop bombs and we known to calm down the savage beast
And the rest of the jungle I'll mistreat
Any MC tryin to fuck with D-A-Z
I represent it to the fullest, it could be a verbal massacre
In ninety-six, with a different approach on shit
I got the flavor, and I'm major
Busta-ass niggas can't stop us, and can't fade us
Shady-ass niggas can't stand next to ya
When the Tek connects to ya
Swift as a cheetah when I'm catchin ya
I betcha I won't let ya escape, face the real on point
They're trained to kill, beyond the violated area
When the smoke clears the area whether I'm toast(?) or at home
I blaze the zag or the bone
Once again another zone is gone
MC's try to step they get lit and blown"

Kanye West	5	Feedback	The Life of Pablo	2016	[Verse 4]	"I've been outta my mind a long time
I've been outta my mind a long time
I know, I know, I shouldn't even bother
With all these gossiping, no-pussy-getting bloggers
Fashion show in Gotham, I need another costume
PETA mad 'cause I made a jacket outta possum
Awesome, Steve Jobs mixed with Steve Austin
Rich slave in the fabric store picking cotton
If Hov J then every Jordan need a Rodman
Man, Jay, they don't really want no problems
Driving in the same car that they killed Pac in
Driving in the same urr that they killed Pac in
Hands up, we just doing what the cops taught us
Hands up, hands up, then the cops shot us"

Pockets racked up, all blue type shit
Bunch of rich niggas, hoes get confused type shit
Atlanta nigga, I live like Ted Turner type shit
On camera, knockin' jaws loose typе shit
I canceled her, kick hеr out the stu' type shit
A silent hitter, I just keep it cool with you bitches
A solid nigga, countin' dog food type shit

Snoop Dogg	0	Gangbangin’ 101	Tha Blue Carpet Treatment	2006	[Verse 1]	"Have you ever seen 100,000 rip riders from the side
Blue Chuck's, blue rags, grey clouds, blue skies
On the move, can't lose, Hill Street blues
Niggas gotta pay they dues on the crews or with the uzi spray
These suckas then I cruise, my granny saw it on the news
She shook up, look up and then she put me on the move
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
'Cause the homies had the loop-loop that night at King Park
And I got into a squab, got caught and went to jail
Straight to the County with no motherfuckin' bail
4800 with this Crippin', oh well
My big homie Boy Blue snatched me by my coattail
He said trip Dogg, ya better get right, Crip right
Eyes open cause niggas get stuck on seez-ight
It ain't no motherfuckin' problem - pop-pop, tick-tock
Never flip-flop, 20 crippin' til I drop"
2Pac	18	Holler If Ya Hear Me	Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...	1993	[Verse 2]	"Pump ya fists like this
Holla if ya hear me, PUMP PUMP if you're pissed
To the sell-outs, livin' it up
One way or another you'll be givin' it up, huh
I guess 'cause I'm black born
I'm supposed to say peace, sing songs and get capped on
But it's time for a new plan, BAM!
I'll be swingin' like a one-man clan
Here we go, turn it up, don't stop
To my homies on the block gettin' dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin' my sound underground for ya
And I'ma throw a change up
Quayle ain't do nothing but blow my name up!
Now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets
They feel me when they rollin' in their fat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song, a black song
Tellin' all my brothers, get their strap on
And look for me in the struggle
Hustlin 'til other brothers bubble"
Common	22	Food for Funk	One Day It’ll All Make Sense	1997	[Chorus]	"Now, to the ladies in the house when you come in the place
It ain't a bunch of niggas all up in your face
The music is thumpin and you're feelin the bass
What you wanna do girl(wanna shout)
To the brothas when you come in a jam, it ain't a bunch of niggas
It ain't high tech and ain't got free liquor
You jackin his name and stick to make you jones get thicker
What you wanna do man?(let go)
Yo, check it"
Eminem	15	Berzerk	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Chorus 2]	"We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud

Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
 (Go berzerk)"
Big Pun	24	Boomerang	Capital Punishment	1998	[Verse 2]	"Now, should I slit my wrists? Go for it all or call it quits?
Picture me taking my life, leaving my wife and my daughter shit
Wish I could slip back and switch the memories
Lift the felonies from my record and respected my enemies
Live like the Kennedy's — above the law
Fuck 'em all! I'm coming for the rich, thieving 'em even if I wasn't poor
I seen it all like I said before
The streets are for men at war, and the beasts are the predators
I shed it all first and be the primary source
Of course, I bury any adversaries tryna floss
Just because, the reason I leave 'em lost in the sauce
Teeing off like we up North just for being soft
A beaten horse like a slave, getting minimum wage
Filling the gauge, front page, these are the last days!
Cash pays and rules — the root of all evil
Shooting amigos for loot, and perico polluting our people
Moving kilos like it's all good through every ghetto
I ain't judging, but bugging, how we fall so many levels?
The Devil's got us by the balls
That's why the law allows the drugs to overflood, knowing we gonna buy it all
It's time to call a world order where every girl's your daughter
And priceless as ice is and pearls fresh out the water
I'm gonna get mine, either from crime or through the Bible
Whichever way, it better pay, I'm feeling suicidal"
Kanye West	5	Bring Me Down	Late Registration	2005	[Verse]	"We goin' to Mass today, we have to pray
Besides what the pastor say?
I have to say, since Pac passed away
Most you rappers don't even deserve a track from me
You see, if you ever wanted to ever be anything
There'd always be somebody that'll shoot down any dream
There'll always be haters, that's the way it is
Hater niggas marry hater bitches and have hater kids
But they gon' have to take my life 'fore they take my drive
'Cause when I was barely livin', that's what kept me alive
Just the thought that maybe it could be better than what we at at this time
Make it out of this grind, 'fore I'm out of my mind
And get some leeway on the ""He say, she say""
Your girl don't like me, how long has she been gay?
Spanish girls say, ""Yo, no hablo inglés""
And everybody want to run to me for their sing-le
It's funny how these wack niggas need my help
Wasn't around when I couldn't feed myself
Dawg, if I was you, I wouldn't feel myself
Dawg, if I was you, I'd kill myself
Made a mil' myself and I'm still myself
And I'ma look in the mirror if I need some help
Now I'll speak from the heart, y'all all frontin'
Everybody feel a way about K but at least y'all feel something"

I'm good-looking, so you know, soon, she be trying me
Heard she bisexual, she fuck with that girl
But boy, oh boy, fucking wit me is a whole 'nother world
After that first night she fall in love, then chase the feelin
I hung out with Marvin when he wrote ""Sexual Healing""
Kurt Cobain—we were good friends; Ozzy Osbourne, too
I be with rock stars—see, you lucky I'm fucking with you
I chilled with Frankie Lymon and Jimi Hendrix crew
See, this is new to you, but to me, this ain't new
I live the lavish life; listen, if the mood is right
Me, you, and your sister can do the do tonight
I never steer you wrong; if you hyper, I make you calm
I'll be your incentive, a reason for you to move forward
Let's make a date, promise me you'll come to see me
Even if it means you have to sell your mama's TV
I love you—love me back; no one said loving me'd be easy"
OutKast	28	The Train	Idlewild	2006	[Verse 1]	"Little do they know when I was brought up in this game
'Twan ain't always in a vibe for spitting, I made a change
Like the diaper on the bottom of my baby daughter
I wasn't ready to be no father, maybe, kinda, sorta
'Cause when I saw her, I swear it made a tear fall
Not tears of sorrow but of joy, so listen here y'all
I grabbed the mic and moved the crowd then disappeared, dog
Back in '94, that was the motherfucking year, homeboy
Then that Southernplayalistic went platinum
Stacks on deck, they ain't tell us to pay our taxes
Walking around the table in the kitchen just for practice
Reciting rhymes to sharpen mine, now let's deliver to the masses"

Semi-automatic weapons that produce ka-pows
Word on the street is they all got heaters

You got a lot of money, I ain't tryna be funny
But they say where you goin', you ain't even gonna need it
(Die) I seen you ridin' round, shinin' with your fine round
Diamonds, pretty green-eyed lady
Been on the sideline, plottin' while you primetime, poppin'
Hungry niggas want a piece of your pastry
I suggest you protect your bakery

Paper chase, different name, same face, don't catch a case
My road dog's on parole, his baby girl's four years old
We play the block, pistol cocked, you could shoot or get shot
Kill you for your crack spot take everything your ass got
Semi-automatic spray, bust back or run away
Niggas talkin in the hood we'll handle this another day
In November you make my shitlist, you dead; you can cancel Christmas
I'll send you a gift, niggas'll come and leave your ass twisted
Them hollow tip shells burn baby burn
See a nigga get merked, a baby's born, man the world turns
I seen it all crystal clear so I keep my pistol near
Heart's never full of fear, homie I stay well aware
Of what's going on around me, motherfuckers want me dead

Willin' to stick out my neck for respect
If it meant life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if it's true
If it's you—what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real?
In confrontation, ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it; if you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable'll leave you full of bullets, pull it
Squeeze it 'til it's empty; tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze"

But I'ma veer, so I don't come near
Like a chicken or a deer, but I remember
I'm not a listener or a seer so my windshield smear
Here you steer, I really shouldn't be behind this
Clearly cause my blindness
The windshield is menstrual, the whole grill is roadkill
So trill and so sincere, yeah, I'm both them there
Took both pills when the bloke in the trench coat
And the locs in the chair had approached him here
Made it clear as a ghost or a biter of the throats in the mirror
The writer of the quotes for the ghosts
Who supplier of the notes to the living
Riveting as Rosie, pockets full of posies

Kanye West	5	No More Parties in LA	The Life of Pablo	2016	[Verse 2]	"Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I 'member Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It just mean, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A thirty-eight-year-old eight-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he funny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep
Get money (Money, money, money)
Big, big money (Money, money, money)
And as far as real friends, tell all my cousins I love 'em
Even the one that stole the laptop, you dirty motherfucker"

Kanye West	5	Crack Music	Late Registration	2005	[Verse 1]	"How we stop the Black Panthers?
Ronald Reagan cooked up an answer
You hear that? What Gil Scott was hearin'
When our heroes or heroines got hooked on heroin
Crack raised the murder rate in D.C. and Maryland
We invested in that, it's like we got Merrill lynched
And we been hangin' from the same tree ever since
Sometimes, I feel the music is the only medicine
So we, cook it, cut it, measure it, bag it, sell it
The fiends cop it, nowadays, they can't tell if
That's that good shit, we ain't sure, man
Put the CD on your tongue—yeah, that's pure, man"
Lupe Fiasco	23	Gotta Eat	Lupe Fiasco’s The Cool	2007	[Verse 2]	"He was a heart breaker
And a law shaker
If it was about caking, he was a partaker
International, he would take trips
Bon voyage, that's how hard he was fishing for the chips
So greedy, never gave to the needy, that's what some say
The way he shunned all the bums hanging in the subways
He called 'em fruits and laughed at 'em
Delivery man, on the pick-up
Drive through and throw a bag at 'em
And it was hard to understand him sometimes
Making a killing, the way he had 'em standing in line
Like"
Kurupt	4	Hate On Me	Space Boogie: Smoke Oddessey	2001	[Verse 3]	"Why do bitches blow dicks?
I don't know that but I can tell you dis, you simple trick
""Now you get it all you want.""
We roll joints we don't fuck with blunts, fuck a blunt now
""Some niggas is worse than ho's""
Holdin' somethin' on your chest let it go
I'll make a bitch blow balls like a ball and sing that song(echoes)...but naked
Most o' y'all niggas be break and hatin' records
The most hatin' done in 8.5 seconds
Why you hatin' Snoopy, you hate Nate and hate me
Why you hatin' Soopa and hatin' on Warren G
Why you hatin' Roscoe, why you hate Damani
Cause he wanna fuck Armani and don't wear Armani
Hatin' Goldie and hatin' Tray Deee, Tray Deee is like fuck'em if they hatin the ""G""
Fuck y'all"

Paintin' pictures, put me in the Louvre, that's a definite
Universal shift, I'm in a groove
And celebrity do not mean integrity, you fool
I'm a good man, shake your hand, firm grip rule
Seventy-two wins, lost ten, ballin' with the flu
More than two M's for a show, but add another two

Nas	9	N.Y. State of Mind Pt. II	I Am...	1999	[Verse 2]	"I'm at the gamblin' spot, my hands on a knot
New York Yankee cap cover my eyes, stand in one spot
I take a nigga dough, send him home to his shoe box
""You lost that, nigga, I'd put your dollar in the jukebox""
Hear my favorite song, all these niggas sing along
All the cigarette smoke's cloggin' my lungs
Hoodrats flashin' they tongue
Young thugs blastin' they gun — we got reputations
Bitches and niggas both on parole or probation
Shit is sick, niggas got gats, army fatigues
I got my eyes glued on whoever walk in or leave
'Cause I ain't playin'
Niggas'll run up in here and shoot up this shit
Stick yo' ass up, niggas'll find the loot in your kicks
Bunch of triple-cross niggas, just New York niggas
Lift you off your feet when they was just talkin' with you
Some of these dudes the Feds be on 'em, you knew 'em for years
Be the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers
That ain't gangsta, niggas is up North with tatted tears
Your name's on the affidavit — you ratted, kid
Faggot-ass niggas that be scared to do they bids
Fuck you! We run you outta N.Y, you can't live
Got your quiet niggas that relocated down South
Comin' back to floss, then you got the jealous loudmouths
All of a sudden, we got Crips and Bloods
D.T.'s runnin' 'round, quick to split yo' mug
It's easy to score, but it's hard to get the shit off
Niggas fightin' over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off
When the fiend come around the block, happy as hell
Niggas mad 'cause they ain't get a piece of that sale
Cutthroat connivers, universal ghetto survivors
Go to any hood that's live and make it liver
A lot of niggas schemin' — some real, some niggas frontin'
But I'm a big dreamer, so watch me come up with somethin'"

Drive my own cars and wear my own clothes
I hang out tough, I'm a real boss
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah, he's so sharp
On the TV screen and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh, you got a gun, so you wanna pop back?
AK-47 now, nigga, stop that
Cement shoes, now I'm on the move
Your family's cryin', now you on the news
They can't find you and now they miss you
Must I remind you, I'm only here to twist you
Pistol-whip you, dip you, then flip you
Then dance to this mothafuckin' music we Crip to
Subscribe, nigga, get your issue
Baby, come close, let me see how you get loose"

Eminem	15	Rhyme or Reason	The Marshall Mathers LP 2	2013	[Verse 3]	"So, yeah, Dad, let's walk
Let's have us a father-and-son talk
But I bet we wouldn't probably get one block
Without me knocking your block off, this is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm so bananas I appealed to all those walks
Of life, whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
'Cause I related to the struggles of young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're rippin' out their fuckin' hair again, it's hysterical
I chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
Yeah, uh-oh, better beware, knuckle heads
The sign of my hustle says:
""Don't knock”, the door's broken, it won't lock
It might just fly open, get cold-cocked
You critics come to pay me a visit?
Misery loves company, please stay a minute
Kryptonite to a hypocrite
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy gettin' stoned in your glass house
To kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out
Mr. Mathers as advertised on the flyers, so spread the word
'Cause I'm promoting my passion 'til I'm passed out
Completely brain-dead: Rain Man
Doing a Bankhead in a restraint chair
So, bitch, shoot me a look, it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas
I'm angrier than all eight other reindeer
Put together with Chief Keef 'cause I hate every fuckin' thang, yeah
Even this rhyme, bitch
And quit tryin' look for a fuckin' reason for it that ain't there
But I still am a ""Criminal""
Ten-year-old degenerate grabbin' on my genitals
The last Mathers LP done went diamond
This time I'm predicting that this one will go emerald (Hehe)
When will the madness end?
How can it when there's no method to the pad and pen?
The only message that I have to send
Is: ""Dad, I'm back at it again"""
50 Cent	19	Westside Story	The Documentary	2004	[Chorus]	"If you take a look in my eyes
You see I be a gangsta 'til I die
That California chronic got me so high

And when you get back, she gon' start up a fight
That night (That night), that night
Baby, it's too late for that, lately, I've been takin' it slow
Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional, like them Eskimos
What would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian-like?
Hmm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes
Five hours later? ""I'll be there in five minutes,"" go 'head, ride with it
I'm so live with it, look how I did it
Been bullshittin' but I finally arrived with it
I know it's late and I took all year but
You can stop complainin' 'cause I'm finally here, yeah"
Kanye West	5	Stronger	Graduation	2007	[Bridge]	"You know how long I've been on ya

Kanye West	5	Heard ’Em Say	Late Registration	2005	[Verse 1]	"And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow, today
From the Chi, like Tim, it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
The things we seen on the screen is not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars—I know it"

I smoke an ounce and bounce at the same time
It's off the limbo with Timbo, you motherfuckin bimbo
So quit knockin at my window, you nympho-maniac
Bring it back, now shake it up
Put it on the table, now break it up
Give it to me, now put a lighter on the end of it

A lot of niggas I know are takin' care of kids that might be mines
I love to go low, I'm freaky like that
I never get caught creeping 'cause I'm sneaky like that, uhh!
It ain't my fault your girl be ho-hoppin'
And matter of fact, the last time you gave her loot to go shoppin'
Honey picked me up some dope shirts
It's because of me why she's walking crooked and her throat hurts
I hate to wait, 'cause I'm not on a patient tip
Just hit me off, we don't need a relationship
And when you mention my name, it ring a bell
Ask any female, nobody do it like L
I met this chick Rhonda, who pushed the black Honda
Took her to the crib and bombed her with this big brown anaconda"

Yeah, I got the money and a half a million dope houses
I got the hookers on the go and player rhymes that I fuck with
And very often, pops my trunk swift
I've been a player since the age of two
That's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk, do how them hustlers do
See, born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be
Always claimin' true to what I do, well then, fuck what I see
I pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up
And made more money 'cause my daddy never showed up
But fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone
Ain't nothin' wrong, you don't belong, you left me standin' alone
Yeah, I'm the nigga with the feather in my hat
Finger waves and snakeskins, shit, I got all that
But you ain't know I'm the one dippin' and dodgin' bullets
The price you pay when you behind it, steady tryin' to pull it

I studied The Mack and Rudy Ray Moore, they were my idols when I was a kid
From nappy head, greasy face, eatin' watermelon
To drug dealer, armed robber, now convicted felon"

Homies died in my arms with his brains hangin', fucked up!
I had to tell him it was alright and that's a lie
And he knew it when he shook and died, my God
Even though I know I'm wrong man
Hennesey make a nigga think he strong, man (Heh-heh)
I can't sleep, so I stay up, don't wanna fuck them bitches
Try to calm me down, I ain't givin' up
I'm gettin' lost in the weed, man, gettin' high
Livin' every day like I'm gon' die (gon' die, gon' die)

Try to kill me I'm the leader, that's coup d'état
Streetsweepers in that Coupé all black, bitches want my chipped tooth back
Steel mac, so my kufi never gets smacked

Still wearing bundles, and spark weed

Because your sweat is a puddle but there's a puddle o' sweat
I'm a threat, so get a cold rag and wipe your neck
And clean the dirt off your face that causes acne
It's ridiculous thinkin' that you can jack me
This is the round where the punch will go
Into your H-E-A-D; that's known as a blow
I'm makin a point but it's a point that I'm makin
Like, see, I'm hatin' the fakin' I keep the suckers like shakin'
Scared to speak with a thought when they're chosen
The sound of my voice in their ear and they're frozen
This is a battle to the death, it's like the same ol'
Against a brother on a tip, with a Kangol
Givin' a pain but it's with pain that I'm givin
But I'm comparin' and tearin' em but I'm makin a livin'
With the hype of a nine volt battery
And the odds for me to conquer is averagely good
