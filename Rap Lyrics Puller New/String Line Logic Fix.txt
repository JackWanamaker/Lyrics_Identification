Okay, I don't know how to solve this problem...

The loops I have been using have been going character
by character. That's all well and good, but now I have lines
involved... This complicates things a great deal...

Reason being is that tags may be across multiple lines,
not just one...

The String processing was easy before, as it was a single
String... No biggie... But now I have built my entire
initial identification system on lines...

Okay, in that case it may be easiest to avoid using multiple
lines altogether... But in that case I am unsure of how
to verify... Wait... Yes I can...

Jesus Christ... I can create a String splice...

And then iterate through adding lyrics until there is a
</div>.
