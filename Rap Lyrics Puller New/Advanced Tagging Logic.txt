Okay, so I have another issue to overcome, which is in
regards to the tags... Right now we have a slight problem...
That being that the tags are saved as strings in an array,
whereas this isn't necessarily the ideal approach...

Instead, I actually need to check if the artist is already
in the Verse in another form... This means that a single
artist can actually share MULTIPLE TAGS... Oh... I see

So not only can multiple artists share a single tag, a
single artist can share mutliple tags... This makes things
more complicated...

In addition, I also need tags removed from the artist header
in the case of ["All"]. In fact, this loop can remain
unchanged! As this is a special case after all... However,
the other case's loop will need to be modified in order to
accomodate the data structure change from array of Strings
to array of arrrays of Strings...

So I will need to reference the array of artists to check
if one of the ones in the & is already in the artist array.
