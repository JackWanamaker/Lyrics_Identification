Array Logic
So I want to figure out the logic of the arrays...

I want to append the artist as an array with a string
inside of it. However, 

[Snoop Dogg, [RBX, Lady of Rage], Dr. Dre]

OR

[[Snoop Dogg], [RBX, Lady or Rage], [Dr. Dre]]

Jewell & Dr. Dre, <i>Snoop Dogg</i>, <b>Snoop Dogg & RBX</b>
