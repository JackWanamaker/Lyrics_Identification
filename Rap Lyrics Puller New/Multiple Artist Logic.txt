<i> without any other artist there?

-Okay, this is a unique problem...As the comma doesn't
always denote a change in the & logic... Wait... If the
& is before the comma it acts as a "single artist",
whereas if it is after the comma but in a tag, it
acts as a "single artist". However, if it is after
the comma but outside of a tag, it acts as a "comma"
to denote two different artists

It is also true that if there is only an & symbol, it
acts as if it is inside a tag

+ acts like a comma

There is one case where the & is between two bold tags
but this shouldn't cause problems? I guess I can actually
make different instances of each artist separate?

Okay so first I'd like to replace the + symbol with a
comma ,

Then, I'd like to replace &s with ,s for cases where they
act like ,s instead of &s
