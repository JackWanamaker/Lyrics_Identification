Styling artist separation logic (oh boy)

First, we need logic that will handle when two artists share
a certain set of lyrics...

Then, we need a separate set of logic that will handle when
there are tags... Perhaps a simple nested array structure
will work fine for this...

We can have an array of the identifiers, ala none, <i>, <b>
and (

Maybe we do it a little differently... Maybe instead we
utilize BeautifulSoup for this task... I think it may make
more sense... Or maybe we create an array of the artists
beforehand based on their tags and essentially map it to
each one?

Damn...

Okay, so we essentially process the logic you have made using
,s and &s... So the array structure will be like this...

We have an array, and for each index there is an additional
array...

When processing ,s we place an artist in a separate index
of the base array, while if it is an &, we place the artist
in a separate index of the inner array...

This way it can be structured that the corresponding lyrics
can be mapped to an artist based on styling, but also mapped
to the same artist if 2 artists both said it...

Hmmm... So I guess
