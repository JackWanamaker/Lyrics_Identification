AND Cases
-Case where there is no comma, tags, and & acts like commas
outside of tags
-Case where there is a comma and & acts like commas outside
of tags
-Case where there is a comma, and & acts like AND inside tags
-Case where there is a comma, and & acts like AND outside
tags, but BEFORE the comma

So the & depends on two things:
1. If inside tags, it acts as an &, or if tags exist but is
before the comma
2. Otherwise, it acts as a ,

I can use this logic to replace the &s I need to with ,s
by taking the not of the if statement
